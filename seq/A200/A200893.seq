%N A200893 Triangle read by rows: number of meanders filling out an n X k grid.
%C A200893 The sequence counts the distinct closed paths that visit every cell of an n-by-k rectangular lattice at least once, that never cross any edge between adjacent squares more than once, and that do not self-intersect. Paths related by rotation and/or reflection of the square lattice are not considered distinct.
