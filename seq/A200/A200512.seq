%N A200512 Least m>0 such that n = y^2 - 2^x (mod m) has no solution, or 0 if no such m exists.
%C A200512 To prove that an integer n is in A051204, it is sufficient to find (x,y) such that y^2 - 2^x = n. In that case, a(n)=0. To prove that n is *not* in A051204, it is sufficient to find a modulus m for which the (finite) set of all possible values of 2^x and y^2 allows us to deduce that y^2 - 2^x can never equal n. The present sequence lists the smallest such m>0, if it exists.

%e A200512 a(0)=a(1)=0 because 0=1^2-2^0 and 1=3^2-2^3 are in A051204. Similarly, n=2 through n=5 are in A051204, i.e., there are (x,y) such that n=y^2-2^x, but for n=6 such (x,y) cannot exist:
%e A200512 a(6)=12 because for all m<12 the equation y^2-2^x = 6 has a solution (mod m), but not so for m=12: Indeed, y^2 equals 0, 1, 4 or 9 (mod 12) and 2^x equals 1, 2, 4 or 8 (mod 12). Therefore y^2-2^x can never be equal to 6, else the equality would also hold modulo m=12.
