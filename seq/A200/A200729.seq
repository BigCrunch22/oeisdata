%N A200729 Smallest nontrivial positive power x such that the number of even powers (i.e., even base) not exceeding x exceeds by n the number of odd powers not exceeding x.
%C A200729 A nontrivial power is a^b where a,b are integers and b>1.
%e A200729 a(2)=216 because there are 11 even powers not larger than 216 and 9 odd powers not larger than 216, and 9 - 7 = 2.
%Y A200729 Cf. A200730.
