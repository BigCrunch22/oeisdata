%N A071915 Number of 1's in the continued fraction expansion of (3/2)^n.
%C A071915 It seems that lim n ->infinity a(n)/n = 0.2... << (log(4)-log(3))/log(2) = 0.415... the expected density of 1's (cf. measure theory of continued fraction).

%e A071915 The continued fraction of (3/2)^24 is [16834, 8, 1, 10, 2, 25, 1, 3, 1, 1, 57, 6] which contains 4 "1's", hence a(24)=4.
