%N A071013 a(0)=1, a(n) is the smallest number > a(n-1) such that the simple continued fraction for S(n)=1/a(0)+1/a(1)+...+1/a(n) contains exactly 2n elements.
%e A071013 The simple continued fraction for S(4)=1+1/2+1/5+1/7+1/12 is [1, 1, 12, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2] which contains exactly 8 elements. The simple continued fraction for 1+1/2+1/5+1/7+1/12+1/25 is [1, 1, 28, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] which contains exactly 10=2*5 elements and 25 is the smallest integer>12 with this property, hence a(5)=25.
