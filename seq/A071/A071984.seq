%N A071984 Square loops: the number of circular permutations (reversals not counted as different) of the numbers 1 to n such that the sum of any two consecutive numbers is a square.
%C A071984 It is unknown whether a circular permutation of the numbers 1 to n exists such that the sum of any two consecutive numbers is a cube.
%C A071984 According to Rivera's Puzzle 311, the smallest n for which a cubic loop exists is 473. - _T. D. Noe_, Nov 26 2007
%C A071984 From _Bert Dobbelaere_, Dec 28 2018: (Start)
%C A071984 It is easy to see that no solutions for n <= 30 can exist: for each value of n <= 30 at least one number exists that can only be paired with at most one other number to form a square (e.g., 18 for n=30 can only be paired with 7). No Hamiltonian cycle can exist if the graph contains a vertex of degree less than 2.
%C A071984 For the case n=31, the nonexistence of a Hamiltonian cycle is less trivial but can be shown by hand.

%e A071984 There is only one possible square loop of minimum length, which is (32, 4, 21, 28, 8, 1, 15, 10, 26, 23, 2, 14, 22, 27, 9, 16, 20, 29, 7, 18, 31, 5, 11, 25, 24, 12, 13, 3, 6, 30, 19, 17) so a(32)=1.
