%N A071990 Numerators of the partial sums of the reciprocals of the upper members of twin prime pairs.
%C A071990 The sum of the reciprocals of the upper bound twin primes is convergent. Proof: If S2 = 1/5 + 1/7 + 1/13 + 1/19 . . . is divergent then S2 + (S1 = 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/11 + 1/17 . . .) is divergent. But S1+S2 = 1/3+1/5 + 1/5+1/7 + 1/11+1/13 ... was proved to be convergent by V. Brun in 1919. So S2 is not divergent and since it is not oscillating, it is convergent as stated.
%e A071990 1/5+1/7+1/13+1/19 = 4084/8645 and 4084 is the fourth entry in the table.
