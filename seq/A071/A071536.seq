%N A071536 Number of extensions to a semigroup of the (categorical) composition of arrows in the complete directed graph on n labeled nodes.
%C A071536 Terms obtained, especially the 147, lend some support to the peculiar conjecture that the composition in any category can be extended to a total, associative operation, that is to a semigroup (not, of course, a monoid).
%e A071536 For n=2, arrows 0:0->0, 1:1->1, f:0->1, g:1->0, the self-dual solution (commutes with reversing arrows) has multiplication table (rows and columns indexed by 0, 1, f, g in order) with rows
%e A071536     0 f f 0
%e A071536     g 1 1 g
%e A071536     0 f f 0
%e A071536     g 1 1 g.
