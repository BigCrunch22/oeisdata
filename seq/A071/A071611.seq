%N A071611 Number of points (i,j,k) on the surface of a sphere around (0,0,0) with squared radius A071609(n).
%C A071611 a(n) is the number of lattice points on a sphere around (0,0,0) with r^2 = A071609(n).

%e A071611 A sphere with radius 1 has 6 lattice points on its surface, so a(1)=6. A sphere with r=sqrt(2) passes through 12 lattice points of the shape (1,1,0), so a(2)=12. A sphere with r=sqrt(5) passes through 24 lattice points with shape (2,1,0), so a(3)=24. A sphere with r=sqrt(9) passes through 6 lattice points of shape (3,0,0) and through 24 lattice points of shape (2,2,1), so a(4)=6+24=30.
