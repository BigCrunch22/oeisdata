%N A370662 Numbers m such that 3 does not divide the m-th Catalan number A000108(m); m such that A067397(m) = 0.
%C A370662 A number m is a term if and only if m = 3*k-1 (k>0), 3*k or 3*k+1 for k in A005836; see A067397.
%C A370662 Conjecture: the only terms of the form 2^r-1 are 0, 1, 3, 31 and 255. Since 2^r-1 !== 2 (mod 3), this is equivalent to saying that the only numbers of the form 2^r-1 that have no digits 2 in ternary are 0, 1, 3, 31, 255. The conjecture would imply that the n-th Catalan number is divisible by 2 or 3 other than n taking these values.

%e A370662 11 is a term since that 3 does not divide the 11th Catalan number 58786. Note that 11 = 3*4 - 1, and 4 is in A005836.
