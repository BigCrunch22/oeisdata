%N A370717 Arithmetic derivative of elements of GF(2)[x], evaluated at x=2.
%C A370717 The indices of this sequence are sorted by evaluation at x=2, i.e. 0, 1, x, x+1, x^2, x^2+1, etc. Generalization of arithmetic derivative is as described by Victor Ufnarovski and Bo Ahlander. For a general UFD this requires a choice of canon primes for which p' = 1. However, GF(2)[x] has only one unit, so there is a unique arithmetic derivative over this UFD.
%C A370717 The arithmetic derivative of a square polynomial in GF(2)[x] is 0 so square polynomials act like units: given f, g in GF(2)[x], (f*f*g)' = f*f*(g'). The arithmetic derivative of a positive degree squarefree polynomial in GF(2)[x] is always nonzero.

%e A370717 To find a(9), first convert 9 into its corresponding GF(2) polynomial x^3 + 1. Then find its arithmetic derivative, x^2. Finally, convert to an integer via evaluation at x=2, giving a(9) = 4.
