%N A370911 a(n) is the smallest positive integer k with k != 10^m (m: nonnegative integer) and with which the fraction 1/n must be expanded so that 1/n can be obtained again by incorrectly reducing the fraction - by deleting the same digit in the numerator and denominator as often as possible, leaving one digit "1" in the numerator.
%C A370911 This sequence shows which fractions should not be used when teaching the reducing of fractions, otherwise there is a risk that learners will develop the misconception that deleting is the same as reducing and that digits can be treated in the same way as factors.
%C A370911 If k were defined for k = 10^m (m: nonnegative integer), every fraction could be expanded with k = 10 followed by deleting the digit "0" at the end of the numerator and denominator and a(n) would be 10 for every n. Therefore, k = 10^m is excluded.
%F A370911 a(n*10^j) = a(n) for positive integers j.
%e A370911 a(4) = 16. 1/4 expanded with 16 is 16/64. If the common digit "6" of the numerator and demoninator is deleted, it continues to be 1/4. There is no smaller value than 16 with that property (except for 10).
%e A370911 a(8) = 101413. 1/8 expanded with 101413 is 101413/811304. If the common digits "0", "1", "1", "3", "4" (leaving a single digit "1" in the numerator) of the numerator and denominator are deleted, it continues to be 1/8. There is no smaller value than 101413 with that property (except for 10, 100, 1000, 10000 and 100000).
%e A370911 a(49) = 1921. 1/49 expanded with 1921 is 1921/94129. If the common digits "1", "2", "9" (choosing the first digit "9" in the denominator to delete and leaving a single digit "1" in the numerator) of the numerator and denominator are deleted, it continues to be 1/49. There is no smaller value than 1921 with that property (except for 10, 100 and 1000).
