%N A370911 a(n) is the smallest positive integer k with k != 10^m (m: nonnegative integer) for which 1/n can be obtained by incorrectly reducing k/(n*k) - by deleting the same digit in the numerator and denominator as often as possible, leaving one digit "1" in the numerator.
%C A370911 This sequence shows which fractions should not be used when teaching the reducing of fractions, otherwise there is a risk that learners will develop the misconception that deleting is the same as reducing and that digits can be treated in the same way as factors.
%C A370911 If k were defined for k = 10^m (m: nonnegative integer), in every fraction 10^m/(10^m*n) the m digits "0" at the end of the numerator and denominator could be deleted and a(n) would be 10 for every n. Therefore, k = 10^m is excluded.

%F A370911 Conjectures from _Felix Huber_, Apr 28 2024: (Start)
%F A370911 a(10^j - 1) = 10^(2*j + 1) + 5*10^j - 5 for positive integers j.
%F A370911 a(10^j - 9) = 10^(2*j) + 1/9*(10^j - 1) for integers j >= 2.
%F A370911 a(i*(10^(j + 1) + 10^j - 1)) = 10^(j + 1) + 1 for positive integers j and integers i, 1 <= i <= 9. (End)
%e A370911 a(4) = 16. 1/4 = 16/(4*16) = 16/64. If the common digit "6" of the numerator and demoninator is deleted, it continues to be 1/4. There is no smaller value than 16 with that property (except for 10).
%e A370911 a(8) = 101413. 1/8 = 101413/(8*101413) = 101413/811304. If the common digits "0", "1", "1", "3", "4" (leaving a single digit "1" in the numerator) of the numerator and denominator are deleted, it continues to be 1/8. There is no smaller value than 101413 with that property (except for 10, 100, 1000, 10000 and 100000).
%e A370911 a(49) = 1921. 1/49 = 1921/(49*1921) = 1921/94129. If the common digits "1", "2", "9" (choosing the first digit "9" in the denominator to delete and leaving a single digit "1" in the numerator) of the numerator and denominator are deleted, it continues to be 1/49. There is no smaller value than 1921 with that property (except for 10, 100 and 1000).
