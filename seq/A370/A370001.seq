%N A370001 Maximum number of induced subgraphs, up to isomorphism, of an n-vertex graph.
%C A370001 The null subgraph is included in the counts.
%C A370001 A graph and its complement have the same number of induced subgraphs.
%C A370001 The number of terms in the n-th row of A263342 is a(n)-n.

%e A370001 The table below shows all optimal graphs for n <= 9. For n = 10, a lower bound obtained by generating several thousands of random graphs is shown, together with a graph attaining this bound. Only one graph in each complementary pair is listed. If there is no known simple description or name of the optimal graphs, they are shown in the graph6 format.

%e A370001 For n = 3, the path graph has 5 induced subgraphs: the null graph, K_1, K_2, the empty graph on 2 vertices, and itself. This is the maximum possible, so a(3) = 5.
