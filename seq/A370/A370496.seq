%N A370496 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is smallest unused number such that a(n) is coprime to a(n-1) and sopfr(a(n)) is coprime to sopfr(a(n-1)), where sopfr(k) is the sum of the primes dividing k, with repetition.
%C A370496 In the first 100000 terms the primes appear in their natural order. In the same range the fixed points begin 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 20, 134, 136, 403, 598, 608, 649, 667. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive numbers.

%e A370496 a(9) = 8 as a(8) = 11 and 8 is the smallest unused number that is coprime to 11, while sopfr(8) = 6 is coprime to sopfr(11) = 11.
