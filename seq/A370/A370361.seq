%N A370361 Smallest smoothness for a length n number with 2 distinct digits, excluding multiples of 10.
%C A370361 The smoothness equals the greatest prime factor, A006530.
%C A370361 Multiples of ten are disallowed, because that would give A010716 (all 5) preceded by 2, 3, 3.
%C A370361 Corresponds to 2-distinct-digit numbers in A370849, except at a(21) where 101010110010001010011 with zero digits is more smooth than 222229999999292992929.
%F A370361 a(n) = A006530(A370849(n)) unless the smoothest solution is (as for n = 21) a number made of digits {0, 1}, currently excluded in A370849. - _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 05 2024
%e A370361 a(7) = 29 as the largest prime factor of the 7-digit number with exactly two distinct digits, 1111222, is 29 and no 7-digit number with exactly two distinct digits has a smaller largest prime factor and no 7-digit number with exactly two distinct digits smaller than 1111222 has a largest prime factor that is equal to 29. - _David A. Corneth_, Mar 05 2024
%e A370361 a(9) = 19, because 799779977 = 17*19^6 has nine digits, two distinct digits and largest prime factor 19. - _Ed Pegg Jr_, Mar 05 2024
