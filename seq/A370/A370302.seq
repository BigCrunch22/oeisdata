%N A370302 Least number of vertices of a graph that contains an induced cycle of length k_i + 3 for i = 1, 2, ..., where n = 2^k_1 + 2^k_2 + ... is the binary expansion of n.

%F A370302 a(2^m) = m+3.
%F A370302 a(2^m-1) = A370301(m+2).
%e A370302 For n = 22 = 2^4 + 2^2 + 2^1, the graph should contain induced cycles of lengths 4+3 = 7, 2+3 = 5, and 1+3 = 4. This is achieved by a graph on 8 vertices consisting of a cycle 1-2-...-7-1 together with an 8th vertex with edges to 1, 3, and 5; the induced cycles of lengths 5 and 4 are 1-7-6-5-8-1 and (for example) 1-2-3-8-1. Clearly, 7 vertices is not sufficient, so a(22) = 8.
