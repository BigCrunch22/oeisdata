%N A370768 Number of signed permutations of length n+2 with adjacent elements differing by more than 1 whose first element is 1 and whose last element has absolute value n+2.
%C A370768 A signed permutation is a sequence (x_1,x_2,...,x_n) of integers such that {|x_1|,|x_2|,...|x_n|} = {1,2...,n}.
%C A370768 Adjacent elements that differ in sign will always differ by more than 1.
%C A370768 a(n) is also half the number of signed permutations of length n+1 with adjacent elements differing by more than 1 whose first element has absolute value 1 or whose last element has absolute value n+1.

%F A370768 a(n) = 2*n*a(n-1) + 4*a(n-2) + 4*(2-n)*a(n-3) + a(n-4) - 2*(2-n)*a(n-5) for n >= 5.
%e A370768 In the following examples, the number of assignments of signs to each unsigned permutation is shown in parenthesis.
%e A370768 a(0) = 1 from the signed permutation (1, -2).
%e A370768 a(1) = 1 from the signed permutation (1, -2, 3).
%e A370768 a(2) = 5: 1234(1), 1324(4). Total is 1 + 4 = 5.
%e A370768 a(3) = 29: 12345(1), 12435(4), 13245(4), 13425(8), 14235(8), 14325(4).
%e A370768 The 2*a(3) = 58 signed permutations of length 4 with adjacent elements differing by more than 1 which start with +-1 or end with +-4 are: 1234(2), 1243(4), 1324(8), 1342(8), 1423(8), 1432(4), 2134(4), 2314(8), 3124(8), 3214(4).
