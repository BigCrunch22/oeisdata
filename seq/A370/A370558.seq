%N A370558 Periodic sequence S_1 of length 28: used to compute the number of times a day from 1 to 28 of a month occurs on a day of the week for the Gregorian cycle of 400 years.
%C A370558 For the Gregorian Calendar (in use since Friday, October 15, 1582) of period legth 400, the number of occurrences of a day d from 1 to 28 of a month on a day D of the week from 0 to 6 (0 for Sunday), can be given for the representative years y fom 0 to 399 (for years congruent to modulo 400, and y >= 1583) by pieces of the present sequence S_1 with period length 28.
%C A370558 These multiplicities are denoted by a length 400 sequence M(d, D) (to be used periodically). It is sufficient to consider the representative days congruent to  modulo 7, namely d = 1 representing 8, 15, 22, d = 2 for 9, 16, 27, ...., d = 7 for 14, 21, 28. Then M(d, D), for d = 1, 2, ..., 7 can be reduced further giving only the results for d = 1 for the seven values of D, using the identity M(d, D) = M(1, (D - d' + 1) mod 7), with d' = 0 if d = 7, and d' = d for 1, 2, 3, ..., 6. This builds a 7 X 7 Toeplitz matrix with main diagonal entries 0, upper diagonal values 1 to 6 and lower ones from 6 to 1. E.g., row d = 6: M(6, D) = M(1, j(D)), with j(D) = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0, 1, for D = 0, 1, ..., 6, respectively.
%C A370558 The results for the seven sequences M(1, D) of length 400 are then composed of subsequences of S_1 (to be used periodically). They are given in detail in the linked WL paper.
%C A370558  E.g., the number of times the first day of a month occurs on a Sunday (0), hence the 13th of a month falls on a Friday (5), is given by the length 400 sequence M(1, 0) encoded by (0)101(17)99(17)101(17)99. This translates to: start with S_1(0) = 1 for all together 101 entries (reaching periodically S_1(16) = 1), then take 17 steps to reach the entry S_1(5) = 1, and go on for 99-1 = 98 entries to reach S_1(19) = 2. Then take another 17 steps to reach S_1(8) = 1, and go on for 101-1 = 100 entries to reach S_1(24). Further 17 steps lead to S_1(13) = 2. The next 99-1 entries end up with S_1(27) = 1, closing a cycle. That always jumps with 17 steps appear is a coincidence.
%C A370558 This gives the 4 pieces of M(1, 0) as S_1, S_1, S_1, S_1(0..16); S_1(5..27), S_1, S_1, S_1(0..19); S_1(8..27), S_1, S_1, S_1(0..24); and S_1(13..27), S_1, S_1, S_1.  Here S_1(i..j) denotes the subsequence S_1(i), S_1(i+1), ..., S_1(j), i.e., a(i), a(1+1), ..., a(j).
