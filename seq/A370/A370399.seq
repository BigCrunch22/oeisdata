%N A370399 Triangle read by rows: T(n, k) is the denominator of the probability of winning a certain game while playing optimally.
%C A370399 T(n, k) is the numerator of the probability of winning a game M(n, k) while playing optimally. The game is played by a single player who begins with n tokens of which k are blue and the rest are red; 0 <= k <= n > 0. Each move consists of randomizing the order of the remaining tokens, observing their resulting order, choosing a number m of tokens to remove, and removing the m tokens that are ordered last; m must be at least 1 but no more than half of the remaining tokens. Play continues until only one token remains; the game is won if that token is blue, otherwise the game is lost.
%C A370399 Let Pr(n,k) be the probability of winning a game M(n,k). Then Pr(n+1,1) = (n/(n-1))*Pr(n,1) if n is a power of 2, Pr(n,1) otherwise. So lim_{n->oo} Pr(n,1) = (1/2)*(2/3)*(4/5)*(8/9)*(16/17)*... = A083864.
%e A370399 The values of Pr(n,k) begin as follows:

%e A370399 We can calculate Pr(4,2) using the table below, given the values of Pr(n,k) for n=3 and for n=2. The leftmost column lists each of the six possible results of randomizing the n=4 tokens during the first move; in each randomized sequence, the red and blue tokens are represented by "r" and "b", respectively.

%e A370399 .
%e A370399 For example, when we get rbrb it's better to remove the last two tokens (one r and one b) instead of removing only the last token (b). So the probability of winning M(4,2) is
%e A370399 Pr(4,2) = (1/6)(1/3) + (1/6)(1/2) + (1/6)(1/2) + (1/6)(2/3) + (1/6)(2/3) + (1/6)(1/1) = 11/18.
%e A370399 Of course Pr(n,k) >= k/n, because k/n could be achieved by removing 1 token on each move.
