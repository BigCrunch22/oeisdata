%N A370158 a(n) is the number of prime quadruples of the form {p, p+2, p+6, p+12} with p < 10^n.
%C A370158 These quadruples are adjacent twin/cousin/sexy prime pairs, and may consist of non-consecutive primes (see A086140).
%e A370158 The third term, the count of quad primes < 10^2, is 4 and they are: (5,7,11,17), (11,13,17,23), (17,19,23,29), (41,43,47,53). The first term, the count of quad primes <10^0, is 0 since the smallest prime is 2.
