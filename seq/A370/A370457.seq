%N A370457 a(n) = n - A368887(n) is the neutron number of the nuclide with the lowest energy among the isobars of mass number n.
%C A370457 A beta-stable nuclide with an odd number of protons or an odd number of neutrons must have the lowest energy among its isobars. (A beta-stable nuclide is a nuclide whose beta decay (beta-minus and beta-plus decay) is energetically disallowed; that is to say, a nuclide that has lower energy than its isobars with one more or one less proton. Note that double beta decay is allowed.) As a result, an odd number N appears in this sequence exactly A368860(N) times. The missing numbers are the odd terms of A370460.
%C A370457 The even numbers that appear only once are the even terms of A370460, except that 54 (96Mo and 98Ru) and 84 (144Nd and 146Sm, the latter being non-primordial) each appears twice; these two numbers surround the elements Tc and Pm which have no beta-stable isotopes. Page 12 of the Zagrebaev et al. link predicts that Nh has no beta-stable isotopes, implying that one of 180 and 182 would be in A370460 but would appear twice in this sequence, depending on which of 294Cn and 294Fl has lower energy.
