%N A370599 a(n) is the number of distinct triangles with integral side-lengths for which the perimeter 2*n divides the area.
%C A370599 If the perimeter 2*n of a triangle with integral edge-lengths divides its area A, then this also applies to a triangle stretched with positive integer k, because A*k^2/(2*n*k) = k*A/(2*n). Therefore a(d) <= a(n) for all positive divisors d of n and a(m) >= a(n) for all positive integer multiples m of n.
%C A370599 With an odd perimeter, according to Heron's formula the area A would have the form A = sqrt((2*k - 1)/8), where k is a positive integer. The area A would be irrational and the integer perimeter would not divide the area A. For this reason, only triangles with an even perimeter are considered in this sequence.

%F A370599 a(n*k) >= a(n) for positive integers k.
%e A370599 a(18) = 1, because only the triangle (9, 10, 17) satisfies the condition: A/(2*n) = 36/36 = 1. (9, 10, 17) is one of the five triangles for which the perimeter is equal to the area (see A098030).
%e A370599 a(42) = 4, because exactly the 4 triangles (10, 35, 39) with A/(2*n) = 168/84 = 2, (14, 30, 40) with A/(2*n) = 168/84 = 2, (15, 34, 35) with A/(2*n) = 252/84 = 3 and (26, 28, 30) with A/(2*n) = 336/84 = 4 satisfy the condition.
%e A370599 a(426) = 0, because no triangle satisfies the condition. Therefore, a(n) = 0 for all n for which n*k = 426 for positive integers k.
