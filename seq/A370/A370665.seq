%N A370665 Number of standard hexagonal Young tableaux with n cells.
%C A370665 A hexagonal Young diagram is a finite collection of hexagons or cells, arranged in center justified rows, with row lengths being either -1 or +1 of any adjacent rows above or below a given row, see illustration in links.
%C A370665 Reading the number of hexagons by row gives a integer composition (ordered partition) where differences between neighboring parts are in {-1,1}. These diagrams can also be drawn with tangent circles on a hexagonal grid oriented pointy side up, see illustration link in A173258.
%C A370665 A standard hexagonal Young tableau is then created by filling the cells of a hexagonal Young diagram with numbers {1..n} such that all rows and downward diagonals form increasing sequences. For every hexagonal young diagram there is at least one hexagonal Young tableau.

%e A370665 The integer composition [2,3,2] of 7, corresponds to the hexagonal Young diagram:
%e A370665   diagram      tableau
%e A370665     0 0          1 2
%e A370665    0 0 0  --->  3 4 5
%e A370665     0 0          6 7
%e A370665 Then filling in the cells sequentially by rows gives the tableau having rows [[1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7]] right diagonals [[3,6], [1,4,7], [2,5]] and left diagonals [[1,3], [2,4,6], [5,7]]; all of which contain increasing sequences.
%e A370665 The a(5) = 6 hexagonal Young tableaux with 5 cells are:
