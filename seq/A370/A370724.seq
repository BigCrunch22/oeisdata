%N A370724 Determinant of n X n Fibonacci word matrix.
%C A370724 Take the first n terms of A003849 and form an n X n matrix by rotating these n terms 1 place to the left in each new row (i.e., a circulant matrix).  This sequence is the determinant of the resulting matrix.
%F A370724 Conjectures:  a(F(n)) = +-F(n-2) where F(n) is the n-th Fibonacci number, and a(L(n)) = +-L(n-2) where L(n) is the n-th Lucas number.
%e A370724 For n=5 the first 5 terms are [0,1,0,0,1] and the resulting matrix is [[0,1,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0,1],[1,0,0,1,0]].  Its determinant is 2.
%Y A370724 Cf. A000032, A000045, A003849, A370725.
