%N A370776 The maximum number of alive cells reached in Conway's Game of Life when starting with the first n primes in Ulam's spiral; or -1 if no such maximum exists.
%C A370776 The initial alive cells are at coordinates x=A214664(i), y=A214665(i) for i=1..n.
%C A370776 For the first 7 terms of this sequence we have a(n)=n since those initial configurations do not lead to complex enough patterns that increase the number of alive cells beyond the initial number of alive cells.
%C A370776 The definition includes the possibility that a glider gun (or a similar pattern) is created which will result in an unbounded number of alive cells.

%e A370776 n=1 to n=4 die out very quickly (within 3 steps). The maximum number of alive cells is simply the number of alive cells in the initial pattern, i.e., n.
%e A370776 n=5 is the first term that leads to somewhat interesting steps in the game of life simulation (although the maximum number of alive cells still does not exceed the initial number 5):

%e A370776 n=8 leads to a maximum number of 65 alive cells and stabilizes after 107 steps. Initial pattern:

%e A370776 n=15 reaches a maximum of 160 alive cells and is the first pattern that leads to having a glider (escaping in the northeast direction). Besides the glider, the stabilized pattern contains 4 blinkers, 3 blocks, 2 beehives and 1 ship.
