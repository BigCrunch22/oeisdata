%N A370459 Number of unicursal stars with n vertices.
%C A370459 A unicursal star is a closed loop formed by diagonals of a regular n-gon.
%C A370459 These are Hamiltonian cycles on the graph complement of the n-cycle.
%C A370459 Allowing polygon diagonals, but not sides, is equivalent to requiring every edge to cross at least one other edge.
%C A370459 These are counted up to rotation and reflection, i.e., modulo dihedral symmetry of the n-gon.
%C A370459 Inspired by a unicursal dodecagram drawn by Gordon FitzGerald (see links).

%e A370459 For n=5, there is only the regular pentagram {5/2}.
%e A370459 For n=6, there is only the unicursal hexagram.
%e A370459 For n=7, in addition to the two regular heptagrams {7/2} and {7/3}, there are three nontrivial unicursal heptagrams represented by:
%e A370459  (0, 2, 4, 1, 6, 3, 5, 0)
%e A370459  (0, 2, 5, 1, 3, 6, 4, 0)
%e A370459  (0, 2, 5, 1, 4, 6, 3, 0).
%Y A370459 Cf. A000940 (polygon sides allowed).
%Y A370459 Cf. A055684 (cases with dihedral symmetry only).
%Y A370459 Cf. A002816 (rotations and reflections counted separately).
%Y A370459 Cf. A231091 (reflections counted separately).
