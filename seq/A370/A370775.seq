%N A370775 Integers m whose (constant) convergence speed is exactly 2 (i.e., m^^(m+1) has 2 more rightmost frozen digits than m^^m, where ^^ indicates tetration).
%C A370775 It is well known (see Links) that as the hyperexponent of the integer m becomes sufficiently large, the constant convergence speed of m is the number of new stable digits that appear at the end of the result for any further unit increment of the hyperexponent itself, and a sufficient (but not necessary) condition to get this fixed value is to set the hyperexponent equal to m plus 1.
