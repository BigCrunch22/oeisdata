%N A370609 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of labeled graphs with vertex set [n] that are reachable in k (but no fewer) steps from a given graph on [n], where a step consists of choosing a subset S of [n] and replacing the subgraph induced by S with its complement, 0 <= k <= n-1.
%C A370609 This is the labeled version of A370072. Here, in contrast to A370072, it does not matter which graph we start with.
%C A370609 Define a graph on 2^(n*(n-1)/2) nodes, where each node corresponds to a labeled graph on [n] and two nodes are adjacent if the symmetric difference of the edge sets of the corresponding graphs equals the set of edges of a complete graph on a subset of [n]. This graph is vertex transitive, and T(n,k) is the number of nodes at distance k from a given node. The independence number of this graph is studied in Alon (2024).
