%N A370633 Numbers k such that A372041(k) = 3.
%C A370633 3 is the smallest positive value occurring in A372041 and occurs when the sum of the squares of the first 2*k+1 primes starting at 3 is a prime.
%F A370633 a(n) = (A160358(n) - 1)/2.
%e A370633 k = 2 is a term since A372041(2) = 3, meaning that the sum of the 2*k+1 = 5 squares of primes starting at 3 is a prime: 3^2 + 5^2 + 7^2 + 11^2 + 13^2 = 373.
