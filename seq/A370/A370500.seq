%N A370500 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number such that a(n) does not share a factor with a(n-1) but sopfr(a(n)) does share a factor with soprf(a(n-1)), where sopfr(k) is the sum of the primes dividing k, with repetition.
%C A370500 The fixed points begin 1, 2, 4, 56, 72, 138, 200, 438, 500, 540, 590, 3998. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A370500 a(4) = 4 as a(3) = 9 and 4 does not share a factor with 9 while sopfr(4) = 4 does share a factor with sopfr(9) = 6.
