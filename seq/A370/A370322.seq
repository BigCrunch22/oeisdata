%N A370322 Least prime p such that exactly n distinct primes can be formed using one or more of the digits of p.
%C A370322 Inspired by A076449.
%C A370322 a(n) >= A076449(n). As an example, a(727) is 3569887, but A076449(727) is 3567889, a difference of 1998. Notice that they possess identical digits.
%C A370322 a(n) = A076449(n) at n = 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 18, 19, 25, 26, 29, 33, 38, 40, 45, 46, ..., .
%C A370322 a(n) <> A076449(n) but they have identical digits at n = 12, 13, 17, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, ..., .
%C A370322 a(n) <> A076449(n) and they do not have identical digits at n = 2, 9, 15, 16, 22, 23, 28, 30, ..., .
%C A370322 The digit 1 is the leading digit >87% of the time.
%e A370322 a(0) would be 1, but 1 is not a prime (A075053);
%e A370322 a(1) is 2, the first prime;
%e A370322 a(2) is 29 since {2 & 29} are primes but {9 & 92} are not;
%e A370322 a(3) is 13 since {3, 13 & 31} are primes, but 1 is not;
%e A370322 a(4) is 37 since all the permutations are prime, i.e.: {3, 7, 37 & 73};
%e A370322 a(5) is 107 since {7, 17, 71, 107 & 701} are primes; etc.
