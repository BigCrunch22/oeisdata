%N A370398 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the numerator of the probability of winning a 1-player game M(n,k) as defined below while playing optimally.
%C A370398 A game M(n,k) is played as follows: play begins with k blue tokens and n-k red; 0 <= k <= n > 0. At each move, the order of the r remaining tokens is randomized and observed, and the player then chooses a number d, 1 <= d <= r/2, and discards the last d of the remaining tokens. The game is won iff the last remaining token is blue.
%C A370398 Let Pr(n,k) be the probability of winning a game M(n,k). Then Pr(n+1,1) = (n/(n-1))*Pr(n,1) if n is a power of 2, Pr(n,1) otherwise. So lim_{n->oo} Pr(n,1) = (1/2)*(2/3)*(4/5)*(8/9)*(16/17)*... = A083864.
%C A370398 The (generally suboptimal) strategy of removing 1 token on each move (regardless of the randomization result) provides Pr(n,k) >= k/n as a lower bound.
%F A370398 T(n,k) = numerator(Pr(n,k)) where Pr(n,k) =
%F A370398    0 if k = 0,
%F A370398    1 if k = n, and
%F A370398    (1/C(n,k))*Sum_{c=1..C(n,k)} Max_{j=1..floor(n/2)} Pr(n-j, k-f(c,j)) otherwise,
%F A370398 and where the summation is over all combinations of n tokens, exactly k of which are blue, and f(c,j) is the number of blue tokens among the last j tokens in the c-th combination.
%e A370398 The values of Pr(n,k) begin as follows:

%e A370398 We can calculate Pr(4,2) given the values of Pr(n,k) for n=3 and n=2 as seen in the table below. The leftmost column lists each of the six possible outcomes (i.e., C(4,2) = 6 combinations, all equally likely) of randomizing the n=4 tokens during the first move; in each randomized sequence (i.e., combination), the red and blue tokens are represented by "r" and "b", respectively. Removing the last j = 1 or 2 tokens will leave n' = n - j remaining tokens of which k' = k - f(c,j) are blue. For each randomized sequence, an asterisk marks the probability of winning using the optimal choice of the number j of tokens to remove.

%e A370398 For example, when we get rbrb it's better to remove the last two tokens (one r and one b) instead of removing only the last token (b).
%e A370398 The probability of winning M(4,2) is the average of the probabilities of winning for each randomized sequence, i.e.,
%e A370398 Pr(4,2) = (1/3 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 2/3 + 2/3 + 1/1)/6 = 11/18.
