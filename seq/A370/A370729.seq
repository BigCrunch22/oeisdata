%N A370729 a(n) is the number of distinct length-n blocks occurring in the characteristic sequence of A228082.
%C A370729 The characteristic sequence is the sequence (b(n)) where b(n) = 1 if n occurs in A228082, and 0 otherwise.  The number of distinct length-n blocks is also called the "factor complexity" or "subword complexity" of (b(n)).
%e A370729 For n = 4, the only blocks that occur are {0101, 0110, 0111, 1010, 1011, 1101, 1110, 1111}, so a(4) = 8.
