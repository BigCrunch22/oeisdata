%N A370504 The smallest positive number such that sopfr(|a(n) - n|) = sopfr(a(n) + n) and Omega(|a(n) - n|) = Omega(a(n) + n), where sopfr(k) is the sum of the primes dividing k, with repetition.
%C A370504 The sequence likely contains all the positive integers, although it takes many terms for some values to appear, e.g., a(41205) = 3. The first value to appear twice is 71 = a(14) = a(20), although numbers which are the product of small primes appear multiple times, e.g., in the first 500000 terms the value 5040 appears 808 times.

%e A370504 a(1) = 13735 as |13735-1| = 13734, 13735+1 = 13736, and soprf(13734) = 124 = soprf(13736), Omega(13734) = 5 = Omega(13736). No smaller number satisfies these requirements.
%e A370504 a(2) = 23 as |23-2| = 21, 23+2 = 25, and soprf(21) = 10 = soprf(25), Omega(21) = 2 = Omega(25). No smaller number satisfies these requirements.
