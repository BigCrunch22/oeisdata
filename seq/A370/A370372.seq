%e A370372 Define quality Q to signify a number neither squarefree nor prime power. For example, 12 has quality Q but smaller numbers do not.
%e A370372 The smallest number k with quality Q such that either (k-1) or (k+1) (or both) share quality Q is 44.
%e A370372 Since both {44, 45} have quality Q, but 43 and 46 are squarefree, a(1) = 2.
%e A370372 Since both {75, 76} have quality Q, but 74 and 78 are squarefree, a(2) = 2.
%e A370372 Since all of {98, 99, 100} have quality Q but 97 and 101 are prime, a(3) = 3, etc.
