%N A370822 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers such that all equal terms appear at mutually coprime indices.
%C A370822 See A279119 for the same sequence with numbers including 0.
%C A370822 See A055396 for a similar sequence where all equal terms share a factor > 1.

%F A370822 a(n) = 1 + A279119(n). - _RÃ©my Sigrist_, Mar 04 2024
%e A370822 a(4)=2 because if we had a(4)=1, then i=2 and i=4, which are not coprime indices, would have the same value 1. So a(4)=2, which is a first occurrence.
%e A370822 a(9)=2 because if we had a(9)=1, i=3 and i=9, would have the same value despite not being coprime indices. a(9) can be 2 because the only other index with a 2 is a(4)=2 and 4 is coprime to 9.
%e A370822 a(15)=4 because 4 is the smallest value such that every previous index at which a 4 occurs is coprime to i=15. In this case, 4 has only occurred at i=8 and 8 is coprime to 15.
