%N A370071 Fibonacci numbers such that some permutation of their digits is a perfect power.
%C A370071 0, 1, 8 and 144 are the only Fibonacci numbers that are themselves perfect powers (see A227875).
%C A370071 A term might have multiple permutations which are perfect powers.
%C A370071 Leading 0 digits are allowed in the perfect power, so that 610 is a term since 016 = 2^4.
%C A370071 From _David A. Corneth_, Feb 17 2024: (Start)
%C A370071 Four ideas to find terms:
%C A370071 1. For each Fibonacci number, check each anagram to determine whether it is a perfect power. A Fibonacci number is a term if and only if such an anagram exists.
%C A370071 2. Let q be the number of digits of some Fibonacci number F. Then check all perfect powers m < 10^q if the frequency of positive digits matches the corresponding positive digits of F and F has at least as many 0's as m. E.g., 610 is a term as the perfect power 16 has the same number of 1's, and the same number of 6's, and 610 has at least as many 0's as 16.
%C A370071 3. Match the last digits of perfect powers and whittle down the number of candidates. So for 46368, a perfect square must end in 4 or 6 for the last digit, 36, 64 or 84 for the last two digits and so on.
%C A370071 4. If some Fibonacci number F has q digits then we could list the possible strings the first floor((q + 1)/2) such numbers could form and see what squares start with those digits. (End)

%e A370071 46368 is a term because it is a Fibonacci number whose digits can be permuted to 36864 = 192^2 (and also to 86436 = 294^2).
%o A370071 (PARI) isok(f) = my(d=digits(f), n=#d); for (i=1, n!, my(p=numtoperm(n, i), dd=vector(#d, i, d[p[i]])); if (ispower(fromdigits(dd)), return(1)););
%o A370071 lista(nn) = my(list = List([0, 1])); for (n=3, nn, my(f=fibonacci(n)); if (isok(f), listput(list, f));); Vec(list); \\ _Michel Marcus_, Feb 17 2024
