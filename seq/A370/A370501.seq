%N A370501 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number such that a(n) shares a factor with a(n-1) but sopfr(a(n)) does not share a factor with soprf(a(n-1)), where sopfr(k) is the sum of the primes dividing k, with repetition.
%C A370501 The fixed points begin 1, 2, 64, 114, 116, 132, and it is plausible no more exist. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A370501 a(6) = 4 as a(5) = 12 and 4 shares a factor with 12 while sopfr(4) = 4 does not share a factor with sopfr(12) = 7.
