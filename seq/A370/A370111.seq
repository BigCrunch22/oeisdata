%N A370111 Least prime p such that the sum of 2i - 1 consecutive primes starting with p is prime for each i <= n and not prime for i = n+1, and -1 if no such prime exists.
%e A370111 a(1) = 2: This is because the sum of 1 consecutive prime number starting with 2 (which is just 2 itself) is also a prime number. Additionally, the sum of 2 * 2 - 1 = 3 consecutive primes starting with 2 (i.e., 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 = 2 * 5) is not prime, and no smaller prime number satisfies this condition.
%e A370111 a(2) = 17: 17 is prime and the sum of 2*2 - 1 = 3 consecutive primes starting with 17 (i.e., 17 + 19 + 23 = 59) is a prime number. However, the sum of 2 * 3 - 1 = 5 consecutive primes starting with 17 (i.e., 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 + 31 = 119 = 7 * 17) is not prime, and no lesser prime number meets this requirement.
