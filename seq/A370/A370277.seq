%N A370277 Numbers k with the property that Dirichlet's Simultaneous Approximation Theorem applied to Z_k is tight (for d = 3).
%C A370277 Dirichlet's Simultaneous Approximation Theorem applied to Z_k states that for all a_1, a_2, ..., a_d, there exists a nonzero p such that |pa_i| <= k^(1 - 1/d) mod k.
%C A370277 For d = 3, the bound of floor(k^(2/3)) is tight only for specific values of k. That is to say, max_(a_1,a_2,a_3) min_p max_i |pa_i| = floor(k^(2/3)) only for specific values of k. These are those values.
%C A370277 This sequence consists of the indices of the zeros in A370278.
%C A370277 It appears that this sequence contains all integers k such that k or k+1 is a cube.

%e A370277 For k = 14, floor(k^(2/3)) = 5. Given the triple (1, 3, 5), there is no choice of p such that |p| mod 14, |3p| mod 14, and |5p| mod 14 are all smaller than 5.
%e A370277 p = 1, 3, 5, 9, 11, and 13 results in a simultaneous minimum of 5.
