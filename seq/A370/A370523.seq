%N A370523 Numbers k > 2 such that all positive values of k - 2^(2^m) are prime, with integer m >= 0.
%C A370523 If k > 4 is a term of this sequence, then (k-2, k-4) is a twin prime pair.
%C A370523 So all terms k > 7 are divisible by 3, and k = 7 is the only prime here.
%C A370523 It seems that there are infinitely many such numbers.
%C A370523 Note that A039669 is finite and probably complete.
%e A370523 The number 15 is a term, since 15-2^(2^0) and 15-2^(2^1) are primes 13 and 11.
%t A370523 q[k_] := Module[{m = 0}, While[2^(2^m) < k && PrimeQ[k - 2^(2^m)], m++]; 2^(2^m) >= k]; Select[Range[4, 15000], q] (* _Amiram Eldar_, Feb 22 2024 *)
