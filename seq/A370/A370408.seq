%N A370408 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers such that no three equal terms appear at distinct indices that are the side lengths of a triangle.
%C A370408 In a triangle, the sum of any two side lengths is greater than that of the third, so that x + y > z.
%C A370408 So if x < y and a(x) = a(y) = t then we cannot have a(z) = t for any z in the range y < z < x+y.
%C A370408 Another way to construct the sequence: Place 1's at the earliest permitted positions (in this case, at Fibonacci indices). Each subsequent value (2’s, 3’s, etc.) is placed at the earliest permitted indices not already occupied by a smaller value. For example, 3's could be placed in a Fibonacci pattern beginning with 7, 9 (7, 9, 16, 25, etc.), but i=7+9=16 is already occupied by the value 2, so 3 gets the next smallest position i=17. i=9+17=26 is again occupied by a 2, so we give 3 the next smallest unoccupied position i=27.
