%N A370199 a(n) is the number of odd polyominoes with n cells.
%C A370199 Whether a polyomino is "odd" is determined by the fact that the permutation defined by assigning the positions from row- or column-wise enumeration of its cells on a square grid is an odd permutation. See the description in the 'Ponder This' challenge for the exact definition.
%C A370199 The terms a(1)-a(10) were given in this description, and a(11)-a(20) were in the solution. The larger terms are results of the program that the user "uau" provided in the Mersenne forum.
