%N A280945 List of primitive triples (x, y, z) of positive integers for which xy - z, yz - x, and zx - y are powers of 2.
%C A280945 There are sixteen such triples, namely (2, 2, 2), the three permutations of (2, 2, 3), and the six permutations of each of (2, 6, 11) and (3, 5, 7).
%C A280945 See the proof in the link.
%C A280945 The sixteen triples are (2, 2, 2), (2, 2, 3), (2, 3, 2), (3, 2, 2), (2, 6, 11), (2, 11, 6), (6, 2, 11), (6, 11, 2), (11, 2, 6), (11, 6, 2), (3, 5, 7), (3, 7, 5), (5, 3, 7), (5, 7, 3), (7, 3, 5) and (7, 5, 3).
%C A280945 This sequence is relative to the 2nd problem, proposed by Serbia, during the 56th International Mathematical Olympiad in 2015 at Chiang Mai, Thailand (see links). - _Bernard Schott_, Mar 17 2021

%e A280945 The 3rd primitive triple (x, y, z) = (2, 6, 11) is in the sequence because xy - z = 1, yz - x = 2^6 and zx - y = 2^4.
