%N A280079 Abscissa of points (x,y) of the square lattice such that x >= 0 and 0 <= y <= x, and ranked in order of increasing distance from the origin. Equidistant points are ranked in order of increasing ordinate.
%C A280079 The points belong to the first half of the first quadrant, and in order are (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), (3,0), (3,1), (3,2), (4,0), (4,1), (3,3), (4,2), (5,0), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), etc.
%e A280079 a(12) = 3 since the twelfth point in distance from the origin is (3,3) at a distance of 3*sqrt(2) = 4.242640... whereas the eleventh is (4,1) at a distance of sqrt(17) = 4.12310... and the thirteenth is (4,2) at a distance of 2*sqrt(5) = 4.472113... .
%e A280079 The fourteenth and fifteenth points are respectively (5,0) and (4,3) and have the same distance 5 to the origin, but (5,0) has a smaller ordinate than (4,3), so a(14) = 5 and a(15) = 4.
