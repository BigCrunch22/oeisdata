%N A280110 Numbers n such that A278981(n) > A278981(m) for 2 <= m < n.
%C A280110 The density of this sequence, and the pattern of A278981(a(n)), seem to suggest that computing the terms of A278981(n) gets exponentially more difficult as n tends to infinity.
%e A280110 a(3) = 7 since A278981(7) = 906, which is greater than all the terms in A278981 which precede it.
%Y A280110 Cf. A278981.
