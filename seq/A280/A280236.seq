%T A280236 96
%N A280236 Numbers n such that A278981(n) < A278981(m) for all m > n (excluding values of m where A278981(m) = 0).
%C A280236 It is not necessary to check A278981(m) for all values of m > n (of which there are infinitely many). One need check only values of a(m) where m^2 + m + 1 <= A278981(n), due to the lower bound of A278981(m).
%C A280236 It appears that all members in this sequence are even, although it is possible that some members could be odd.
%C A280236 It appears that, apart from 2, all members in this sequence appear in A280270. If this is the case, all members in this sequence must be even.
%e A280236 6 is a member of this sequence as A278981(6) = 57, which is which is less than all the terms in A278981 which succeed it.
%e A280236 One need check only values of a(m) where m^2 + m + 1 <= 57. In this case, only m=7 needs to be checked, and A278981(7) = 906, with 906 >= 57. Thus A278981(6) < A278981(m) for all m > 6.
%Y A280236 Cf. A278981, A280270.
