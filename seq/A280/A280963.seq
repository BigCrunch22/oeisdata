%N A280963 Numbers n such that for all divisors of n, ratios of 2 consecutive divisors of n will always reduce to lowest terms to a fraction with numerator=denominator+2.
%C A280963 This sequence is similar to A140110. Both sequences concern numbers such that consecutive divisors of these numbers have a ratio which is of the form (k+1)/k for A140110 and (k+2)/k for this sequence.
%C A280963 So for each q >= 1, one can define a corresponding sequence where the said ratio is of the form (k+q)/k. It appears that such sequences are reduced to a single term 1 when q+1 is not prime. On the other hand when p=q-1 is prime (see A006093), then these sequences include the terms 1, p, p^2, .... so they are infinite.
%C A280963 The sequence of powers of 3 (A000244) is a subsequence. And all terms except 1 are divisible by p, here 3.
%e A280963 9 is in the sequence for the following reason. Divisors of 9 are {1,3,9}; ratios formed by pairing adjacent divisors are 3/1,9/3, both reduce to 3/1. The difference between numerator and denominator is 2 in both cases. - _Michael De Vlieger_, Jan 11 2017
