%N A280616 Smallest m such that the m - s is a prime for exactly n distinct squarefree numbers s.
%e A280616 a(1) = 3 because 3 - 1 = 2 is prime where 1 is squarefree number.
%e A280616 a(2) = 4 because 4 - 1 = 3 and 4 - 2 = 2 are primes where 1 and 2 are squarefree numbers.
%e A280616 a(3) = 9 because 9 - 2 = 7, 9 - 6 = 3, 9 - 7 = 2 are primes where 2, 6, 7 are squarefree numbers.
