%N A280223 Precipice of n: descending by the main diagonal of the pyramid described in A245092, a(n) is the height difference between the n-th level (starting from the top) and the level of the next terrace.
%C A280223 The structure of the stepped pyramid arises after the 90-degree-zig-zag folding of the diagram of the isosceles triangle A237593.
%C A280223 The terraces at the n-th level of the pyramid are also the parts of the symmetric representation of sigma(n).
%C A280223 The stepped pyramid is also one of the 3D-quadrants of the stepped pyramid described in A244050.
%C A280223 Note that if a(n) > 1 then the next k terms are the first k positive integers in decreasing order, where k = a(n) - 1.
%C A280223 For more information about the precipices see A277437 and A280295.
%C A280223 a(n) is also the number of numbers >= n whose largest Dyck paths of the symmetric representation of sigma share the same point at the main diagonal of the diagram. For more information see A237593.

%e A280223 Descending by the main diagonal of the stepped pyramid, for the levels 9, 10 and 11 we have that the next terrace is in the 12th level, so a(9) = 12 - 9 = 3, a(10) = 12 - 10 = 2, and a(11) = 12 - 11 = 1.
