%N A280740 After S(n)=A280864(n) has been computed, let p(n) = product of distinct primes shared by S(n-1) and S(n); let q(n) = product of distinct primes in S(n) but not in S(n-1); and let r(n) = smallest number not yet in S. Sequence gives r(n).
%C A280740 We use the convention that an empty product is 1.
%C A280740 By decree, gcd(S(n+1),p(n)) = 1, gcd(S(n+1),q(n)) = q(n) = p(n+1), S(n+1) >= r(n). (Note p(n) is as defined above; it is not the n-th prime.)
%C A280740 Conjecture: except for the four terms equal to 25, a(n) is always a prime, and all the primes appear and in their natural order.
%C A280740 The conjecture is true for n up to 10^7. - _Lars Blomberg_ Jan 14 2017
