%N A280317 Ordinate of points (x,y) of the square lattice such that x >= 0 and 0 <= y <= x, and ranked in order of increasing distance from the origin. Equidistant points are ranked in order of increasing ordinate.
%e A280317 a(12) = 3 since the twelfth point in distance from the origin is (3,3) at a distance of 3*sqrt(2) = 4.242640... whereas the eleventh is (4,1) at a distance of sqrt(17) = 4.12310... and the thirteenth is (4,2) at a distance of 2*sqrt(5) = 4.472113... .
%e A280317 The fourteenth and fifteenth points are respectively (5,0) and (4,3) and have the same distance 5 to the origin, but (5,0) has a smaller ordinate than (4,3), so a(14) = 0 and a(15) = 3.
