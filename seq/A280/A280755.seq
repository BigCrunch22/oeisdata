%N A280755 Numbers n such that 3n appears earlier than 2n in A280864.
%C A280755 Normally (at least as indicated by all the evidence so far), 2n appears earlier than 3n in A280864. The present sequence lists the exceptions.

%e A280755 A280864(114) = 195 = 3*65 appears before A280864(130) = 130 = 2*65, so 65 is a term.
%e A280755 A280864(178) = 285 = 3*95 appears before A280864(190) = 190 = 2*95, so 95 is a term.
%e A280755 It is a bit surprising that both 130 and 190 are fixed points of A280864 (cf. A280754).
%Y A280755 Cf. A280864, A280754.
