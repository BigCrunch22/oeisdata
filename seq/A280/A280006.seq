%N A280006 Number of possible connected steric graphs with n nodes of degree less than 5, excluding the ones with all nodes of degree 4 and trees.
%C A280006 Also number of hypothetical neutrally charged hydrocarbons with n carbon atoms containing a cyclic set of atoms (cycloalkanes and alkyl-cycloalkanes) satisfying the octet rule. This includes all isomers except conformers.
%C A280006 Steric (three-dimensional) graphs can be represented as two-dimensional graphs provided that stereoisomers are taken into account. This means acting the group S_4 on the stereocenters (nodes with 4 different substituents) of each 2D graph and counting all of the resulting non-symmetric molecules.
%C A280006 The terms of this sequence (and related ones) were found by drawing and counting the hydrocarbons in the PDFs below. If there are any missing molecules you can contact me. I'll add them in the PDF and update the data section.
%C A280006 Many of those "theoretical" molecules are to be discovered and some may not exist due to their strained geometries.
