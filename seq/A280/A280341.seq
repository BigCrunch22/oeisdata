%N A280341 Number of distinct heights achieved in the Collatz (or '3x+1') problem when starting from numbers in the range [2^n,2^(n+1)).
%C A280341 Here the height is defined to be the number of halving and tripling steps required to reach 1.
%C A280341 Interestingly the values in this sequence grow slowly (almost linearly) indicating that the average number of starting values with the same height increases with n.
%C A280341 Question: Is this sequence always increasing?
%C A280341 Definition corrected by _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 09 2020. The old definition was "Number of unique heights achieved in the Collatz (or '3x+1') problem when starting from numbers in the range [2^n,2^(n+1))."
%C A280341 This sequence a(n) as well as the sequence of maximum heights in each interval appear to increase quadratically with n.  The odd numbers in [2^n, 2^(n+1)) , 5 <= n <= 20, create all distinct heights for the interval except for height n of number 2^n, and except for height n+3 when n is odd. - _Hartmut F. W. Hoft_, Dec 16 2020
%e A280341 The heights for starting values 16 to 31 are: 4, 12, 20, 20, 7, 7, 15, 15, 10, 23, 10, 111, 18, 18, 18, 106. The unique heights are: 4, 12, 20, 7, 15, 10, 23, 111, 18, 106. Hence a(4)=10.
