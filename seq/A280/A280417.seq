%N A280417 Number of distinct length-n blocks (a.k.a. subword complexity) of the characteristic sequence of the prime numbers A010051.
%C A280417 Unlike A023192, this sequence also counts blocks that occur finitely often in A010051. And unlike A023192, the correctness of the numbers provided here depend on no conjecture.
%e A280417 For n = 4, the 9 blocks (in the order they occur in A010051) are 0110,1101,1010,0101,0100,1000,0001,0010,0000.
%Y A280417 Cf. A010051, A023192.  A280418 gives the length of shortest prefix needed to get all blocks that occur.
