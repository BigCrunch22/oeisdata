%N A280356 Number of ways to write n as x^4 + y^3 + z^2 + 2^k, where x,y,z are nonnegative integers and k is a positive integer.
%C A280356 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 1, and a(n) = 1 only for n = 2, 23, 1135, 6415, 6471.
%C A280356 (ii)  If P(x,y) is one of the polynomials 3*x^4 + y^3 and x^6 + 3*y^2, then any positive integer n can be written as P(x,y) + z^2 + 2^k with x,y,z and k nonnegative integers.
%C A280356 We have verified that a(n) > 0 for all n = 2..2*10^7, and that part (ii) of the conjecture holds for all n = 1..10^7.
%C A280356 We also find finitely many polynomials of the form a*x^m + b*y^2 (including x^4 + y^2 and 10*x^5 + y^2) with a and b positive integers and m <= 5, for which it seems that any positive integer can be written as P(x,y) + z^2 + 2^k with x,y,z,k nonnegative integers.
%C A280356 See also A280153 for a similar conjecture involving powers of 4 or 8.
%C A280356 Qing-Hu Hou at Tianjin Univ. has verified that a(n) > 0 for all n = 2..10^9. In 2017, the author announced to offer US $234 as the prize for the first correct solution to his conjecture that a(n) > 0 for all n > 1. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Dec 30 2017

%e A280356 a(2) = 1 since 2 = 0^4 + 0^3 + 0^2 + 2^1.
%e A280356 a(23) = 1 since 23 = 2^4 + 1^3 + 2^2 + 2^1.
