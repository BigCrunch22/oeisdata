%N A104477 Number of successive squarefree intervals between primes.
%C A104477 Find the number (the "run length") of successive intervals [p, p'=nextprime(p)] (followed by [p', p''], then [p'', p'''] etc.) which do not contain a square. When a square (n+1)^2 is found in such an interval, this will result in a term a(2n) = 0, preceded by a(2n-1) = the number of intervals of primes counted before reaching that square, i.e., between n^2 and (n+1)^2. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 01 2018

%F A104477 a(2n) = 0: this is the interval from the greatest prime less than the (n+1)th square, through that square and up to the least prime greater than that square. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Apr 23 2005
%F A104477 a(2n-1) = the difference between the indices of the greatest prime less than (n+1)^2 and the least prime greater than n^2. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Apr 23 2005
%F A104477 a(2n-1) = A014085(n) - 1 = primepi((n+1)^2) - primepi(n^2) - 1. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 01 2018
%e A104477 a(1)=1 because the first interval between primes (2 to 3) is free of squares.
%e A104477 a(2)=0 because there is a square between 3 and 5.
%e A104477 a(7)=2 because there are two successive squarefree intervals: 17 to 19; and 19 to 23.
%e A104477 a(8)=0 because between 23 and 29 there is a square: 25.
