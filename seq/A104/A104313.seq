%N A104313 Numbers n such that the coefficient of x^(2n) in (x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)^n is prime.
%C A104313 n such that A005191(n) is prime. No other n<10000. The primes are in A104314. Only coefficients of the x, x^(2n) and x^(4n-1) terms can be prime; the coefficients of x and x^(4n-1) terms are prime whenever n is prime.
%C A104313 No other n<195316. Most likely this sequence is finite. Terms A005191(n) that are not a multiple of 5 have zero density, namely, there are fewer than n^(log(4)/log(5)) such terms among A005191(1..n). In particular, A005191(5k+2) and A005191(5k+4) are multiples of 5 for every k. - _Max Alekseyev_, Apr 25 2005
