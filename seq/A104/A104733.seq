%N A104733 Triangle T(n,k) = sum_{j=k..n} Fibonacci(n-j+1)*Fibonacci(k+1), read by rows, 0<=k<=n.
%F A104733 Matrix product of T(n,k) = sum_j A104762(n+1,j)*A104763(j+1,k), both interpreted as lower triangular square arrays.
%e A104733 The first few rows of the triangle are:
%e A104733 1;
%e A104733 2, 1;
%e A104733 4, 2, 2;
%e A104733 7, 4, 4, 3;
