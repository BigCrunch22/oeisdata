%N A104231 Triangle read by rows, based on the morphism f: 1->2, 2->3, 3->{3,3,5,4}, 4->5, 5->6, 6->{6,6,2,1}. First row is 1. If current row is a,b,c,..., then the next row is a,b,c,...,f(a),f(b),f(c),...
%C A104231 This substitution was suggested by looking at output of the symbols of an actual Kenyon border tiling program.
