%N A104768 Number of matrices G with entries in Z satisfying G^2=G+1 and having the form 2G=[1+p q-2n | q+2n 1-p].
%C A104768 The matrix solutions to G^2=G+1 are gI, g'I (where g is the golden number and g'=1-g) and the matrices 2G=[1+p q-B | q+B 1-p]. It is easy to see that B must be even.
%F A104768 a(n)=8*104767(n) if n != 1, a(1)=4.
