%N A104461 Number of instances of nonprimes m in Pythagorean triples x,y,z such that x^2 + y^2 = z^2. Except for 1, the number of instances of composite numbers m in Pythagorean triples.
%C A104461 The PARI script is direct and very fast for m = x,y values but slows in the trial routine for m = z. We save some time for m even allowing the testing of only even values of y.
%F A104461 Consider Pythagorean triples x^2 + y^2 = z^2. We seek to find the total number of instances of an integer m being x or y or z. The solution for x or y is straightforward by considering appropriate lesser and greater pairwise factors, L, G of m^2 in z^2 - y^2 = (z-y)(z+y) = m^2. Then solve for z and y with the relations, z-y = L z+y = G 2z = L+G, z = (L+G)/2 where L and G are both even if m is even or both odd if m is odd. The number of L factors < m is the number of instances of x or y. The count of instances z=m is solved by trial on x^2 = m^2 - y^2.
