%N A104552 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of Schroeder paths of length 2n having trapezoid weight k.
%C A104552 A Schroeder path is a lattice path starting from (0,0), ending at a point on the x-axis, consisting only of steps U=(1,1), D=(1,-1) and H=(2,0) and never going below the x-axis. Schroeder paths are counted by the large Schroeder numbers (A006318).
%C A104552 A trapezoid in a Schroeder path is a factor of the form U^i H^j D^i (i>=1, j>=0), i being the height of the trapezoid. A trapezoid in a Schroeder path w is maximal if, as a factor in w, it is not immediately preceded by a U and immediately followed by a D. The trapezoid weight of a Schroeder path is the sum of the heights of its maximal trapezoids. For example, in the Schroeder path w=UH(UHD)D(UUDD) we have two trapezoids (shown between parentheses) of heights 1 and 2, respectively. The trapezoid weight of w is 1+2=3.
%C A104552 This concept is an analogous to the concept of pyramid weight in a Dyck path (see the Denise-Simion paper). Row sums yield the large Schroeder numbers (A006318). Column 1 yields the even-subscripted Fibonacci numbers (A001906).
