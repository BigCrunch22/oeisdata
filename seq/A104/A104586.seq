%N A104586 Pentagonal wave sequence triangle.
%C A104586 Row sums = A086500: 1, 9, 18, 50, 75, 147, 196...
%F A104586 Odd columns are terms of A104584, pentagonal wave sequence of the first kind, (starting with 1): 1, 7, 12, 26, 35, 57, 70... Even columns are terms of A104585, pentagonal wave sequence of the second kind (starting with 2): 2, 5, 15, 22, 40, 51... Odd rows are pentagonal numbers (A000326) starting with "1" at the right. Even rows are second pentagonal numbers (A005449) starting with 2 at the right. The triangle is extracted from a matrix product A * B, A = [1; 1, 2; 1, 2, 1; 1, 2, 1, 2;...], B = [1; 3, 1; 5, 3, 1; 7, 5, 3, 1;...] (both infinite lower triangular matrices, with the rest zeros).
