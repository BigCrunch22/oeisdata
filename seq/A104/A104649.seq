%N A104649 Numerators (denominators are all 840) of x-coordinates of four points on the parabola y = x^2, x >= 0, at rational distances (distance between any two points is rational).
%F A104649 The distance formula between points on the parabola y = x^2.
%e A104649 We need 6 Pythagorean triples such that the ratios of the sides satisfies
%e A104649 (a+d = b+f = c+e) where x1+x2 = a, x2+x3 = b, x1+x3 = c, x3+x4 = d
%e A104649 (45/28 + 3551/840 = 171/140 + 775/168 = 91/60 + 1209/280). Solve for x1,x2,... to get the sequence.
