%N A104740 a(1) = 1; for n > 1: if n is even, a(n) = least k > 0 such that sum(i=1,n/2,a(2*i-1))/sum(j=1,n,a(j))>=1/4, or 1 if there is no such k; if n is odd, a(n) = largest k > 0 such that sum(i=1,(n+1)/2,a(2*i-1))/sum(j=1,n,a(j))<=1/3, or 1 if there is no such k.
%C A104740 If this sequence is interpreted as describing a 0-1-sequence: a(1) 1's followed by a(2) 0's followed by a(3) 1's ... (alternatingly), then the portion of 1's in that 0-1-sequence oscillates between 1/4 and 1/3, except for a slight disturbance at the beginning. Quite analogously, sequences can be constructed that describe 0-1-sequences where the portion of 1's oscillates between arbitrary bounds 0 < r < s < 1. However, depending on the choice of the bounds, the initial disturbance may extend rather far.
%C A104740 Interleaving of A073941 and A081848 from a(3) onward.
%e A104740 Consider n = 10; for k = 5 we have (1+1+1+1+2)/(1+3+1+3+1+3+1+3+2+k) = 6/23 < 1/4, but for k = 6 we have
%e A104740 (1+1+1+1+2)/(1+3+1+3+1+3+1+3+2+k) = 6/24 >= 1/4, hence a(10) = 6. Consider n = 11; for k = 3 we have
%e A104740 (1+1+1+1+2+k)/(1+3+1+3+1+3+1+3+2+6+k) = 9/27 <= 1/3, but for k = 4 we have (1+1+1+1+2+k)/(1+3+1+3+1+3+1+3+2+6+k) = 10/28
%e A104740 > 1/3, hence a(11) = 3.
