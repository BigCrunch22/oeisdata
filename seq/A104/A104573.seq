%N A104573 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of Motzkin paths of length n having trapezoid weight k.
%C A104573 A Motzkin path is a lattice path starting from (0,0), ending at a point on the x-axis, consisting only of steps U=(1,1), D=(1,-1) and H=(1,0) and never going below the x-axis. Motzkin paths are counted by the Motzkin numbers (A001006).
%C A104573 A trapezoid in a Motzkin path is a factor of the form U^i H^j D^i (i>=1, j>=0), i being the height of the trapezoid. A trapezoid in a Motzkin path w is maximal if, as a factor in w, it is not immediately preceded by a U and immediately followed by a D. The trapezoid weight of a Motzkin path is the sum of the heights of its maximal trapezoids. For example, in the Motzkin path w=UH(UHD)D(UUDD) we have two maximal trapezoids (shown between parentheses) of heights 1 and 2, respectively. The trapezoid weight of w is 1+2=3.
%C A104573 This concept is analogous to the concept of pyramid weight in a Dyck path (see the Denise-Simion paper).
%C A104573 Row sums yield the Motzkin numbers (A001006).
%C A104573 Row n has 1+floor(n/2) terms.
%C A104573 T(2n+1,n)=(n+2)*2^(n-1) (A001792).
