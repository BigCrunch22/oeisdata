%N A104290 a = a(n) is such that the a-th prime p(a) is the least prime with digital sum equal to n, or a(n)=0 if no such prime exists.
%C A104290 a(1)=0 because there is no prime with digital sum equal to 1, a(2)=1 because p(1)=2 is the least prime with digital sum equal to 2, a(3)=2 because p(2)=3 the only prime with digital sum equal to 3, a(3k>3)=0 because there is no prime with digital sum equal to 3 (besides p(2)=3), a(53)=77777 because p(77777)=989999 is the least prime with digital sum (9+8+9+9+9+9) equal to 53. For the first 1,000,000 primes, the maximal digital sum is 62 (for p(658445)=9899999).
