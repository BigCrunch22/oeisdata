%N A104347 a(n) is the number of integers m such that (digit reversal of m) - m = 9*n.
%C A104347 For any n>0, a(n) is finite (or zero) and a(0) is infinite (because there are an infinite number of palindromes).
%e A104347 a(7)=2 because there are only two integers m such that (digit reversal of m) - m = 9*7=63, namely 18 and 29: 81-18=63 and 92-29=63.
