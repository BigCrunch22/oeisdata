%N A104160 Primes equal to a sum of primes with differences congruent to (2,4) mod 6.
%C A104160 Consider finite ordered subsequences of at least 2 distinct primes A000040 subject to the conditions:
%C A104160 (i) the first differences of the subsequence are the initial terms of A047235,
%C A104160 (ii) the sum of the terms of the subsequence is a prime,
%C A104160 (iii) the subsequence is maximum in the sense that it cannot be extended by appending larger primes and still maintaining the conditions (i) and (ii).
%C A104160 Then the (prime) sum of the subsequence is one term of this sequence here.
%C A104160 The terms are inserted in order of the smallest prime in the subsequence.
%e A104160 a(1)=353 because 353 = 5+7+11+19+29+43+59+79+101.
%e A104160 a(2)=41 because 41 = 11+13+17.
%e A104160 a(3)=131 because 131 = 17+19+23+31+41.
%e A104160 a(4)=131 because 131 = 41+43+47.
%e A104160 a(5)=311 because 311 = 101+103+107.
