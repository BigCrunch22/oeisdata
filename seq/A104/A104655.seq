%N A104655 Let c(i) = A018252(i) be the i-th nonprime; then the final entry in row n of A101513 is c(a(n)) (see A104656), for n >= 3.
%C A104655 The entries up to 66 have been checked, but the remaining entries are based on my hypothetical formula (see A101513). (It would be easy to check them.)
%C A104655 I have checked that these are correct entries from the triangle, but not that they match the hypothetical formula (from A101513). - _Joshua Zucker_, May 20 2006
