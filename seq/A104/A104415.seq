%F A104415 a(n) = A001222(A079262(n+6)).
%e A104415 a(0)=a(1)=0 because the first two nonzero octanacci numbers are both 1, which has zero prime divisors.
%e A104415 a(2)=1 because the 3rd nonzero octanacci number is 2, a prime, with only one prime divisor.
%e A104415 a(3)=2 because the 4th nonzero octanacci number is 4 = 2^2 which has (with multiplicity) 2 prime divisors (which happen to be equal).
%e A104415 a(4)=3 because the 5th nonzero octanacci number is 8 = 2^3.
%e A104415 a(10)=3 because A079262(10) = 255 = 3 * 5 * 17 which has 3 prime factors.
%Y A104415 Cf. A001222, A079262, A104411, A104412, A104413, A104414.
