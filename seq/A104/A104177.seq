%N A104177 A variation on Flavius's sieve (A000960): Start with the natural numbers; at the k-th sieving step, remove every f-th term of the sequence remaining after the (k-1)-st sieving step, where f is the (k+2)-nd Fibonacci number, f=F(k+2); iterate.
%C A104177 This sequence is approximately as dense as the lucky numbers or primes: there are 195 of these numbers, 153 lucky numbers and 168 primes less than 1000.
