%N A104886 Sequence A048138, the number of times that a positive integer occurs as the sum of proper divisors, if Goldbach partitions (two odd primes, which account for most of the values) are ignored.
%F A104886 a(n) = number of m such that the sum of the proper divisors of m is n, ignoring m if m is the product of two different odd primes.
%e A104886 a(13)=1 because s(27)=1+3+9 and s(35)=1+5+7=13 however 35's factors 3 and 5 are a Goldbach partition, so 35 is not counted.
