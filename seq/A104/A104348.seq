%N A104348 a(n) is the number of integers m such that m -(digit reversal of m) = 9*n.
%C A104348 For any n>0, a(n) is finite (or zero) and a(0) is infinite (because there are an infinite number of palindromes).
%e A104348 a(8)=2 because there are only two integers m such that m - (digit reversal of m) = 9*8=72, namely 80 and 91: 80-(08)=80-8=72 and 91-19=72.
