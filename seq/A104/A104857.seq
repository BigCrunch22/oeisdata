%N A104857 Positive integers that cannot be represented as the sum of distinct Lucas 3-step numbers (A001644).
%C A104857 Similar to A054770 "Numbers that are not the sum of distinct Lucas numbers (A000204)" but with Lucas 3-step numbers (A001644). Wanted: equivalent of _David W. Wilson_ conjecture (A054770) as proved by Ian Agol. Note that all positive integers can be presented as the sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers in A000119 way. Catalani called Lucas 3-step numbers "generalized Lucas numbers" but that is quite ambiguous. These are also called tribonacci-Lucas numbers.

%e A104857 In "base Lucas 3-step numbers" we can represent 1 as "1", but cannot represent 2 because there is no next Lucas 3-step number until 3 and we can't have two instances of 1 summed here. We can represent 3 as "10" (one 3 and no 1's), 4 as "11" (one 3 and one 1). Then we cannot represent 5 or 6 because there is no next Lucas 3-step number until 7 and we can't sum two 3s or six 1's. 7 becomes "100" (one 7, no 3s and no 1's), 8 becomes "101" and so forth.
