%N A125212 Numbers m such that no prime exists of the form |k! - m|; or A125211(m) = 0.
%C A125212 Note the triples of consecutive zeros in A125211 for n = {{50,51,52}, {56,57,58}, {86,87,88}, {92,93,94}, ...}. Most zeros in A125211 have even indices. The middle index of most consecutive zero triples in A125211 is odd and is a multiple of 3. Numbers n such that no prime exists of the form (k! - 3n - 1), (k! - 3n), (k! - 3n + 1) are listed in A125213. The first pair of odd middle indices of zero triples that are not divisible by 3 is n = 325 and n = 329. They belong to the first septuplet of consecutive zeros in A125211. A125211(n) = 0 for 7 consecutive terms from n = 324 to n = 330.
