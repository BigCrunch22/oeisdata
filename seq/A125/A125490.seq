%N A125490 Amicable triples: numbers such that sigma(x) = sigma(y) = sigma(z) = x+y+z, x<y<z. We order these triples according to the common value of sigma. Sequence gives x numbers.
%C A125490 G. Resta computed these terms.
%C A125490 As stated, we first order by common sigma value. When the common value of sigma is the same for several triples, these are then sorted (ascending) by the smallest member. When the smallest members also agree, we go on to the second smallest members, and so on, lexicographically. - _John Cerkan_, Jun 18 2016
