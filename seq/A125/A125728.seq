%F A125728 a(n) = Sum_{j=1..n} Sum_{k|(n*j)} mu(k) * floor(j/k), where mu(k) is the Mobius (Moebius) function and the inner sum is over the positive divisors, k, of (n*j).
%e A125728 The positive integers coprime to k and <= k are, as k runs from 1 to 8, 1; 1; 1, 2; 1,3; 1,2,3,4; 1,5; 1,2,3,4,5,6; 1,3,5,7. So we want, so as to get a(8), the number of 1's, 3's, 5's and 7's in this concatenated list, since the positive integers <=8 and coprime to 8 are 1,3,5,7. In the concatenated list there are eight 1's, four 3's, three 5's and one 7. So a(8) = 8 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 16.
