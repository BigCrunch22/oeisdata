%N A125749 a(n) is the smallest positive integer such that (Sum_{1<=k<=a(n), gcd(t(k),n)=1} t(k)) is >= n, where t(k) is the k-th positive integer which is coprime to n.
%e A125749 The positive integers which are coprime to 12 are 1,5,7,11,13,... Now 1+5 = 6, which is less than 12; but 1+5+7 is 13, which is >= 12. 7 is the 3rd positive integer which is coprime to 12, so a(12) = 3.
