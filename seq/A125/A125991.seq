%N A125991 A106486-encodings of combinatorial games with zero value.
%C A125991 In these games, the second player can always win.

%e A125991 Game 0 is encoded as zero, giving the first term of this sequence. Also 24 belongs into this sequence, as it encodes game {-1|1}, which the second player always wins. Similarly for game {*|*} which has code 2^(1+2*3) + 2^(2*3) = 192, thus 192 is a member of this sequence.
%Y A125991 Row 1 of A126000. Intersection of A126001 and A126002. Characteristic function occurs as row 0 of A126010.
