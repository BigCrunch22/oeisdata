%N A125992 A106486-encodings of combinatorial games with value 1.
%C A125992 These are codes for games which belong to the same equivalence class as the game {0|} (i.e. game 1).

%e A125992 Game {0|} is encoded as 2^(2*0) = 1, thus 1 is the first term of this sequence. Also 17 belongs into this sequence, as it encodes game {-1,0|}, where, as the option -1 is dominated by option 0, the former can be deleted, resulting the same game {0|}. Also code 65536 (= 2^(2*(2^(1+2*1)))) belongs into this sequence, as it encodes the game {{|1}|}, which is reversible to game 1.
