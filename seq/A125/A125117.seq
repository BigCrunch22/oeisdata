%N A125117 First differences of A034887.
%C A125117 This sequence is not periodic because log(2)/log(10) is an irrational number. - _T. D. Noe_, Jan 10 2007
%C A125117 The sequence consists only of 0's and 1's. Sequence A276397 (with a 0 prefixed) is similar but differs from a(42) on. Sequence A144597 differs only from a(102) on. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 07 2016

%F A125117 a(n) = number_of_digits{2^(n+1)} - number_of_digits{2^(n)} with n>=0.
%e A125117 a(1)=0 because 2^(1+1)=4 (one digit) 2^1=2 (one digit) and the difference is 0.
%e A125117 a(3)=1 because 2^(3+1)=16 (two digits) 2^(3)=8 (one digit) and the difference is 1.
