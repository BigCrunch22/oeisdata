%N A125756 Numbers n whose reverse binary representation has the following property: let a 0 mean "halving" and a 1 mean "k -> 3k+1". The number describes an operation k -> f_n(k). If the equation f_n(k) = k has a positive integer solution, n is a term in the sequence.
%C A125756 Suggested by A125626.
%C A125756 Note that f_n(x) is always a linear function of x.
