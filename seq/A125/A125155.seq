%N A125155 The k-sequence associated with A125151.
%C A125155 A permutation of the positive integers.
%D A125155 Clark Kimberling, Interspersions and fractal sequences associated with fractions (c^j)/(d^k), Journal of Integer Sequences 10 (2007, Article 07.5.1) 1-8.
%F A125155 This sequence k(m) is associated with the array T(2,3,1) at A125151 as follows: row m consists of numbers of the form Floor[(2^p)/(3^k)] for k=k(m).
%e A125155 The pairs (j,k) for the first six rows are (2,1), (5,2), (7,3), (9,4), (11,5), (13,6).
%e A125155 First term in row m is Floor[(2^j(m))/(3^k(m))], so for m=1,2,3, the first terms are 1=[(2^2)/(3^1)], 3=[(2^5)/(3^2)], 4=[(2^7)/(3^3)].
%Y A125155 Cf. A125151.
%K A125155 nonn
