%N A125065 a(1)=1. a(n) is the smallest positive integer not occurring earlier in the sequence such that a(n)/gcd(a(n), a(n-1)) is not a prime.
%C A125065 Sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.
%e A125065 a(22) = 27 because 27 is the smallest positive integer not occurring among the first 21 terms of the sequence such that a(22)/gcd(a(22), a(21)) = 27/gcd(27, 24) = 9 is not a prime.
%e A125065 a(8) = 5 because 5 is the smallest positive integer not occurring among the first 7 terms of the sequence such that a(8)/gcd(a(8), a(7)) = 5/gcd(5, 10) = 1 is not a prime.
