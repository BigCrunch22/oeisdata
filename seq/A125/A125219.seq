%N A125219 a(n) is the smallest positive integer not occurring earlier in the sequence such that sum{k=1 to n} a(k) = j^r, j = any positive integer, r = any integer >= 2.
%C A125219 Is this sequence a permutation of the positive integers?
%e A125219 The sum of the first 7 terms of the sequence is 32. 17 is the smallest positive integer m that does not occur earlier in the sequence and is such that 32+m is of the form j^r, r >=2. So a(8) = 17 and the sum of the first 8 terms of the sequence is 49 = 7^2.
