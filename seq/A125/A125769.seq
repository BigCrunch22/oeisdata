%N A125769 a(n) is the least number j such that j*T_k +/- 1 is n-th prime for some k-th triangular number.
%C A125769 Eventually all primes p appear since (p +/-1) times 1(1+1)/2 equals (p +/- 1).
%C A125769 If we asked for the least number k then k always equals 1 since all primes p appear since (p +/-1) times 1(1+1)/2 equals (p +/- 1).
%C A125769 The k's for the corresponding j's are: round(sqrt(2p/j)).
%C A125769 First occurrence of i is A125770: 1, 2, 7, 9, 34, 31, 54, 15, 16, 26, 148, 68, 398, 62, 193, 25, 27, 140, 550, 397, 107, 113, ...,.
%e A125769 a(1) = 1 because 1*1+1 = 2 which is the first prime,
%e A125769 a(2) = 2 because 2*1+1 = 3 which is the second prime,
%e A125769 a(3) = 4 because 1*6-1 = 5 which is the third prime,
%e A125769 a(8) = 3 because 2*10-1 = 19 which is the eighth prime, ...
