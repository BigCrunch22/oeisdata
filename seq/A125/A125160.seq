%N A125160 The fractal sequence associated with A125152.
%C A125160 If you delete the first occurrence of each n, the remaining sequence is the original sequence; thus the sequence contains itself as a proper subsequence (infinitely many times).

%F A125160 a(n)=number of the row of array A125152 that contains n.
%e A125160 1 is in row 1 of A125152; 2 in row 2; 3 in row 1;
%e A125160 4 in row 3; 5 in row 4; 6 in row 2, so the fractal
