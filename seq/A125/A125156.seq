%N A125156 The k-sequence associated with A125152.
%C A125156 A permutation of the nonnegative integers.
%D A125156 Clark Kimberling, Interspersions and fractal sequences associated with fractions (c^j)/(d^k), Journal of Integer Sequences 10 (2007, Article 07.5.1) 1-8.
%F A125156 This sequence k(m) is associated with the array T(3,2,0) at A125152 as follows: row m consists of numbers of the form Floor[(3^p)/(2^k)] for k=k(m).
%e A125156 The pairs (j,k) for the first six rows are
%e A125156 (0,0), (2,2), (2,1), (4,4), (5,5), (7,8).
%e A125156 First term in row m is Floor[(3^j(m))/(2^k(m))],
%e A125156 so for m=1,2,3, the first terms are
%e A125156 1=[(3^0)/(2^0)], 2=[(3^2)/(2^2)], 4=[(3^2)/(2^1)].
%Y A125156 Cf. A125152.
