%N A125998 A106486-encodings of combinatorial games equivalent to game {1|1}.
%C A125998 These are codes for games which belong to the same equivalence class as the game {1|1}, the impartial game 1*.

%e A125998 Game {1|1} is encoded as 2^(2*1) + 2^(1+2*1) = 12, thus 12 is the first term of this sequence. Also 13 belongs into this sequence, as it encodes game {0,1|1}, where, as the option 0 is dominated by option 1, the former can be deleted, resulting the same game {1|1}.
