%N A125310 Numbers n such that n = sum of deficient proper divisors of n.
%C A125310 Since any proper divisor of a perfect number is deficient, all perfect numbers are (trivially) included in the sequence.
%C A125310 Hence the interesting terms of the sequence are its non-perfect terms, which I call "deficiently perfect". 90 is the only such term < 10^8. Are there any more?
%C A125310 If a(n) were defined to be those numbers that are equal to the sum of their deficient divisors, then the sequence would begin with 1.  So, up to 10^10, the only non-perfect numbers in that sequence would be 1 (a deficient number) and 90 (an abundant number). - _Timothy L. Tiffin_, Jan 08 2013
%C A125310 a(8) > 10^10. - _Giovanni Resta_, Jan 08 2013
%C A125310 These "deficiently perfect" numbers are pseudoperfect (A005835) and are a proper multiple of a nondeficient number (and hence abundant).

%e A125310 90 has deficient proper divisors 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 15, 45, which sum to 90. Hence 90 is a term of the sequence.
