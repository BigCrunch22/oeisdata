%N A125266 Number of repetitions in A007918.
%C A125266 Except for the first 2 terms, these numbers are always even. Conjecture: the number 2 occurs infinitely often in this sequence.
%C A125266 Essentially the same as A075526 and A054541. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jun 15 2008
%C A125266 3 together with A001223. - _Omar E. Pol_, Nov 01 2013
%e A125266 A007918(0) = 2, A007918(1)=2, A007918(2) = 2. So 2 repeats 3 times, giving 3 as the first term in the table.
