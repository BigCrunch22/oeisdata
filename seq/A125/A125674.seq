%N A125674 For any number larger than 2, the primes reached when you start with n and concatenate the sum of its prime factors with its largest prime factor, then repeat the process until you eventually reach a prime, or print a -1 if you never do.

%e A125674 Start with 4. Its factors are 2 and 2. Sum them to get 4 and then concatenate that to its largest prime factor to get 42. It is not a prime. The factors of 42 are: 2, 3, 7. Sum them to get 12 and concatenate it with its largest prime factor to get 127. That number is prime. So a(4) = 127.
