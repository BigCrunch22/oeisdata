%N A125996 A106486-encodings of combinatorial games equivalent to game {1|0}.
%C A125996 These are codes for games which belong to the same equivalence class as the game {1|0}.

%e A125996 Game {1|0} is encoded as 2^(2*1) + 2^(1+2*0) = 6, thus 6 is the first term of this sequence. Also 7 belongs into this sequence, as it encodes game {0,1|0}, where, as the option 1 dominates the option 0 on the left side, the former can be deleted, resulting the same game {1|0}.
