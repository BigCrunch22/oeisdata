%N A125060 Irregular array where a(1)=1; run n of the sequence is the first a(n-1) integers from among those positive integers which are coprime to n and which do not occur earlier in the sequence {a(k)}.
%C A125060 This sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.
%e A125060 The sequence grouped by runs, where run n, after the first 1, consists of a(n-1) terms:
%e A125060 1,(3),(2,4,5),(7,9),(6,8,11,12),(13,17,19,23,25),(10,15,16,18,20,22,24),...
%e A125060 a(5) is 5. So run 6 contains the first 5 positive integers which do not occur earlier in the sequence and which are coprime to 6, (13,17,19,23,25).
