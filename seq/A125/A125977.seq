%Y A125977 Inverse: A125978. a(n) = A057163(A125976(n)). The number of cycles, maximum cycle sizes and LCM's of all cycle sizes in range [A014137(n-1)..A014138(n-1)] of this permutation are given by A126317, A126318 and A126319. The number of fixed points seems to be given by A123050 and fixed points themselves are probably given by A126312. Cf. also A126313-A126316.
%Y A125977 Differs from A071661 for the first time at n=43, where a(n)=40, while A071661(43)=34. Differs from A071666 for the first time at n=34, where a(n)=47, while A071666(34)=48.
