%N A125626 Numbers n whose reverse binary representation has the following property: let a 0 mean "halving" and a 1 mean "k -> 3k+1". The number describes an operation k -> f_n(k). If the equation f_n(k) = k has a positive solution, n is a term in the sequence.
%C A125626 The terms in this sequence have the following characterization. Suppose the binary expansion of n contains i 1's and j 0's. Then it is easy to see that n is in the sequence if and only if 3^i < 2^j, or i/j < log 2 / log 3 = 0.630929753... - _David Applegate_ and _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 01 2007
%C A125626 Note that f_n(x) is always a linear function of x.

%C A125626 Could be used in conjunction with the Collatz (or 3x+1) conjecture. If the positive solution k is an integer (most are not) then a cycle exists. If this cycle does not contain a 1 and the sequence of steps agrees with what Collatz's rule tells you to do when you start with k, then the Collatz conjecture would be false.
%e A125626 Consider the term 200: its binary representation is 11001000. Reversing this gives 00010011. We solve (3*(3*(((3*(((k/2)/2)/2)+1)/2)/2)+1)+1) = k and find k = 40. Since k is positive, 200 is a member of the sequence.
