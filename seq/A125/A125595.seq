%N A125595 a(1)=1, a(n) = the least positive number not yet in sequence which added to max(a(1)..a(n-1)) gives a prime.
%C A125595 Apparently an arrangement of positive integers. Among the first 1000 terms in the sequence, the first absent numbers are: 809,890,902,908,920,926,932,938,944,945,963,968,977,986,998. Fixed points of the arrangement are: 1,2,3,4,6,61,106,137,419,452,486,557,730.

%e A125595 n=7: ss={1,2,3,4,7,6}, max(ss)=7; a(7)=the least positive number d not yet in ss such that max(ss)+d is prime, d=10, 7+10=17, hence a(7)=10.
