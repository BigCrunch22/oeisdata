%C A125084 If n is of the form 4^i*(8j+7) (where i>=0, j>=0) then n^3 is not in the sequence because n^3 is of the mentioned form so n^3 is in A004215 hence according to the definition n^3 is not in this sequence (see formula for A004215). Hence 7^3, 15^3, 23^3, 28^3, 31^3, 39^3, ... are not in the sequence. Is there a number n such that n^3 is not in the sequence but n is not of the form 4^i*(8j+7)? - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Nov 23 2006
%C A125084 A number n^3 belongs to this sequence if and only if n is sum of three squares. Proof is immediate from Catalan's identity (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^3 = x^2*(3*z^2 - x^2 - y^2)^2 + y^2*(3*z^2 - x^2 - y^2)^2 + z^2*(z^2 - 3*x^2 - 3*y^2)^2. - _Artur Jasinski_, Dec 09 2006
%C A125084 If n = a^2 + b^2 + c^2, then n^3 = (n*a)^2 + (n*b)^2 + (n*c)^2. Conversely, suppose there were an n such that n^3 is in A000378 but n is not. Then n must be of form 4^k*(8i+7). But n^3 would also be of the form 4^k*(8i+7) and thus n^3 would not be in A000378, contradicting the original assumption. This argument is easily extended to all odd powers, i.e., n^(2k+1) is in A000378 iff n is in A000378. - _Ray Chandler_, Feb 03 2009

%e A125084 125 is in the sequence because
%e A125084   125 = 5^3 = 0^2 + 2^2 + 11^2
%e A125084             = 0^2 + 5^2 + 10^2
%e A125084             = 3^2 + 4^2 + 10^2
%e A125084             = 5^2 + 6^2 +  8^2.
%e A125084    27 = 3^3 = 1^2 + 1^2 +  5^2, so  27 is a term.
%e A125084   125 = 5^3 = 0^2 + 2^2 + 11^2, so 125 is a term.
%e A125084   216 = 6^3 = 2^2 + 4^2 + 14^2, so 216 is a term.
