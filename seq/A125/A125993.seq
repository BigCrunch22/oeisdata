%N A125993 A106486-encodings of combinatorial games with value -1.
%C A125993 These are codes for games which belong to the same equivalence class as the game {|0} (i.e. game -1).

%e A125993 Game {|0} is encoded as 2^(1+2*0) = 2, thus 2 is the first term of this sequence. Also 10 belongs belongs into this sequence, as it encodes game {|0,1}, where, as the option 0 dominates the option 1, the latter can be deleted, resulting the same game {|0}. Likewise code 8589934592 (= 2^(1+(2*2^(2*2)))) belongs into this sequence, as it encodes the game {|{-1|}}, which is reversible to game -1.
