%N A125288 a(n) = least integer k such that for all integers m greater than k, 2*Pi(n,m) is greater than Pi(n,2*m).
%C A125288 Pi(n, m) is the number of integers <= m that have n prime factors counting multiplicity, also known as n-almost-primes (A078840).
%e A125288 a(1) = 10 since the first term relates to 1-almost-primes, which are the primes themselves; and there are 4 primes <= 10, and 2*4 = 8 primes <= 2*10 = 20; but for m = 11 and all larger integers, the number of primes <= 2*m is less than twice the number of primes <= m. - _Peter Munn_, Dec 23 2022
