%N A125147 a(0)=1; for n >= 1, a(n) is the smallest positive integer not occurring earlier in the sequence such that Sum_{k=0..n} a(k) is a multiple of n.
%C A125147 Sequence A019444 is a similar sequence, but it has an offset of 1 and a(1) =1 instead.
%C A125147 This sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.  This can be proved using the theorem-prover Walnut. - _Jeffrey Shallit_, Aug 12 2023

%e A125147 a(5) = 9 because 9 is the smallest positive integer m which does not occur earlier in the sequence and which is such that 5 divides m + Sum_{k=0..4} a(k).
%e A125147 So Sum_{k=0..5} a(k) = 25, which is divisible by 5.
