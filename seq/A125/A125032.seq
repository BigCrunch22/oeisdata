%N A125032 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = number of tournaments with n players which have the k-th score sequence. The score sequences are in the same order as A068029 and start with the empty score sequence.
%C A125032 The score sequences are sorted by number of players and then lexicographically.
%C A125032 There are A000571(m) score sequences for m players. The sum of all the a(n) for m players is A006125(m)=2^(m(m-1)/2).
