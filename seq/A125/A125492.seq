%N A125492 Amicable triples: numbers such that sigma(x) = sigma(y) = sigma(z) = x+y+z, x<y<z. We order these triples according to the common value of sigma. Sequence gives z numbers.
%C A125492 _Giovanni Resta_ computed the first 12 terms.
%C A125492 As stated, we first order by common sigma value. When the common value of sigma is the same for several triples, these are then sorted (ascending) by the smallest member. When the smallest members also agree, we go on to the second smallest members, and so on, lexicographically. - _John Cerkan_, Jun 18 2016
