%N A125844 a(n) = the smallest positive integer which does not occur earlier in the sequence and which is coprime to the n-th composite integer.
%C A125844 This sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.
%e A125844 The positive integers which do not occur among the first 6 terms of the sequence are 4,6,8,9,10,12,... Of these integers, 9 is the smallest that is coprime to 14, the 7th composite. So a(7) = 9.
