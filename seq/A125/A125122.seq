%N A125122 First differences of A034888.
%C A125122 This sequence is not periodic because log(3)/log(10) is an irrational number. - _T. D. Noe_, Jan 10 2007
%F A125122 a(n)=Number_of_digits{3^(n+1)}-Number_of digits{3^(n)} with n>=0.
%e A125122 a(1)=0 because 3^(1+1)=9 (one digit) 3^1=3 (one digit) and the difference is 0
%e A125122 a(4)=1 because 3^(4+1)=243 (three digits) 3^(4)=81 (two digits) and the difference is 1
