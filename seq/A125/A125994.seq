%N A125994 A106486-encodings of combinatorial games equivalent to game {0|0}.
%C A125994 These are codes for games which belong to the same equivalence class as the game {0|0} (i.e. game *).

%e A125994 Game {0|0} is encoded as 2^(2*0) + 2^(1+2*0) = 3, thus 3 is the first term of this sequence. However, 11 also belongs into this sequence, as it encodes game {0|0,1}, where, because the option 0 dominates the option 1 on the right hand side, the latter can be deleted, resulting the same game {0|0}.
