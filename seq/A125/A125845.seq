%H A125845 Sam Vandervelde, <a href="http://www.mandelbrot.org">The Mandelbrot Competition</a>, round 2, 2006-07, asked for the smallest composite number in this list.
%e A125845 1 is the only one-digit number with only one factor. Two-digit primes are the only two-digit numbers in the list since they have a one-digit factor (1) and a two-digit factor (themselves). Three-digit squares of two-digit primes are the only three-digit numbers in the list, since only numbers of the form p^2 can have three factors.
%Y A125845 A125315 gives the smallest n-digit number of this form for each n.
