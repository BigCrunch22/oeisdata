%N A125077 #4 in an infinite set of generalized Pascal's triangles with trigonometric properties.
%C A125077 Row sums are powers of 4. The triangle is #4 in an infinite of generalized Pascal's triangles constrained by two rules: row sums are powers of N and upward sloping diagonals (as coefficients to polynomials with alternating signs) have roots N + 2*cos(2*Pi/Q).
%C A125077 Right border, A001835, and next to right border, A001353 = bisections of denominator of continued fraction [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]; i.e., bisection of A002530. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Jun 21 2009
%F A125077 Upward-sloping diagonals of the triangle are derived from (alternating) characteristic polynomials of two types of matrices: those of the form: (all 1's in the super and subdiagonals and 3,4,4,4,... in the main diagonal) and (all 1's in the super and subdiagonals and 4,4,4,... in the main diagonal.
%e A125077 First few rows of the triangle are:

%e A125077 The upward-sloping diagonal (1, 11, 38, 41) relates to the heptagon and in the form x^3 - 11x^2 + 38x - 41 has a root 5.24697960... = 4 + 2*cos(2*Pi/7). The corresponding matrix is [3, 1, 0; 1, 4, 1; 0, 1, 4]. The next upward-sloping diagonal relates to the octagon, with a characteristic polynomial x^3 - 12x^2 + 46x - 56 and a root 5.414213562... = 4 + 2*cos(2*Pi/8). The corresponding matrix is [4, 1, 0; 1, 4, 1; 0, 1, 4].
