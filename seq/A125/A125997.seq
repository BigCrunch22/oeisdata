%N A125997 A106486-encodings of combinatorial games equivalent to game {0|1}.
%C A125997 These are codes for games which belong to the same equivalence class as the game {0|1} (game 1/2).

%e A125997 Game {0|1} is encoded as 2^(2*0) + 2^(1+2*1) = 9, thus 9 is the first term of this sequence. Also 25 (= 2^(2*2) + 2^(2*0) + 2^(1+2*1)) belongs into this sequence, as it encodes game {-1,0|1}, where, as the option -1 is dominated by option 0, the former can be deleted, resulting the same game {0|1}.
