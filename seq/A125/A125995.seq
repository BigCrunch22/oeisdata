%N A125995 A106486-encodings of combinatorial games with value 2.
%C A125995 These are codes for games which belong to the same equivalence class as the game {1|} (i.e. the game 2).

%e A125995 Game {1|} is encoded as 2^(2*1) = 4, thus 4 is the first term of this sequence. Also 5 belongs into this sequence, as it encodes game {0,1|}, where, because the option 1 dominates the option 0 on the left side, the zero can be deleted, resulting the same game {1|}.
