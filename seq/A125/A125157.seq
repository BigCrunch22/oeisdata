%N A125157 The k-sequence associated with A125153.
%C A125157 A permutation of the positive integers.
%D A125157 Clark Kimberling, Interspersions and fractal sequences associated with fractions (c^j)/(d^k), Journal of Integer Sequences 10 (2007, Article 07.5.1) 1-8.
%F A125157 This sequence k(m) is associated with the array T(3,2,1) at A125153 as follows: row m consists of numbers of the form Floor[(3^p)/(2^k)] for k=k(m).
%e A125157 The pairs (j,k) for the first six rows are
%e A125157 (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (7,8).
%e A125157 First term in row m is Floor[(3^j(m))/(2^k(m))],
%e A125157 so for m=1,2,3, the first terms are
%e A125157 1=[(3^1)/(2^1)], 2=[(3^2)/(2^2)], 3=[(3^3)/(2^3)].
%Y A125157 Cf. A125153.
