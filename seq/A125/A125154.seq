%N A125154 The k-sequence associated with A125150.
%C A125154 A permutation of the nonnegative integers.
%D A125154 Clark Kimberling, Interspersions and fractal sequences associated with fractions (c^j)/(d^k), Journal of Integer Sequences 10 (2007, Article 07.5.1) 1-8.
%F A125154 This sequence k(m) is associated with the array T(2,3,0) at A125150 as follows: row m consists of numbers of the form Floor[(2^p)/(3^k)] for k=k(m).
%e A125154 The pairs (j,k) for the first six rows are
%e A125154 (0,0), (5,2), (4,1), (9,4), (8,3), (13,6).
%e A125154 First term in row m is Floor[(2^j(m))/(3^k(m))],
%e A125154 so for m=1,2,3,4,5,6, the first 3 terms are
%e A125154 1=[(2^0)/(3^0)], 3=[(2^5)/(3^2)], 5=[(2^4)/(3^1)].
%Y A125154 Cf. A125150.
%K A125154 nonn
