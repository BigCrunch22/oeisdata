%C A249573 Smallest p = prime(i) such that A280720(i) = n, where i is the index of p in A000040. - _Felix Fröhlich_, Jan 07 2017

%C A249573 a(10) > 10^10.
%C A249573 It seems very likely that a(11) exists. But is it possible that this sequence is finite? Each row of the table below shows, for an interval of width 10^8, the number of primes p within the interval that remain prime through exactly 0 iterations, exactly 1 iteration, etc. E.g., in the interval [10^9, 10^9 + 10^8), there are 4437075 primes p that remain prime through exactly 0 iterations, 326699 that remain prime through exactly 1, 45062 that remain prime through exactly 2, etc.

%C A249573 The numbers in column 0 drop at a rate that is not surprising, given that the way that the density of primes drops as numbers get larger. The numbers in the other columns drop more rapidly, in relative terms. Suppose a similar table were constructed using much wider intervals (perhaps with intervals starting not at 1, 10^8, 10^9, 10^10, etc., but at 1, 10^30, 10^31, 10^32, etc.), so that the numbers in, say, column 12 remained positive through several rows, but were dropping by a factor of more than 10 from one row to the next, making it likely that the total number of k-digit primes -- not just those from intervals of a fixed size -- that would remain prime through 12 iterations was actually decreasing as k increased. Would such an outcome suggest that the sequence might be finite? (End)
%e A249573 With p = 13: 5 * 13 + 2 = 67, 5 * 67 + 2 = 337 and 5 * 337 + 2 = 1687. 67 and 337 are both prime, but 1687 is not, so 13 remains prime through exactly two iterations of 5 * x + 2 and is the smallest prime with this property, so a(2) = 13.
