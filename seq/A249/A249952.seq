%N A249952 Rank of first single 1 in A000002 such that A249949 takes the value n.
%C A249952 It is not known if this sequence is defined for any n > 0; showing that it is would solve some of the problems posed by Clark Kimberling about the Kolakoski sequence A000002 (see the link), at least the 2nd and 3rd problems.
