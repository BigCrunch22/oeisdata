%N A249724 Numbers k such that on row k of Pascal's triangle there is no multiple of 9 which would be less than any (potential) multiple of 4 on the same row.
%C A249724 Disjoint union of {0} and the following sequences: A048278 (gives 7 other cases where there are neither multiples of 4 nor 9 on row k), A249722 (rows where a multiple of 4 is found before a multiple of 9), A249726 (cases where the least term on row k which is a multiple of 4 is also a multiple of 9, and vice versa, i.e., such a term a multiple of 36).
%C A249724 If A249717(k) < 3 then k is included in this sequence. This is a sufficient but not necessary condition, e.g., A249717(25) = 5, but 25 is also included in this sequence.
