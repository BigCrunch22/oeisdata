%N A249907 Smallest positive integer k such that k contains all possible pairs of digits when represented in base b = n >= 2.
%C A249907 In base b, there are b^2 distinct pairs of digits and the smallest positive integer to contain all of them will have (b^2)+1 digits. For example, in base 2 there are 2^2 = 4 distinct pairs: 00, 01, 10, 11. All of them are represented in the 5-digit binary number 10011 = 19 in base 10.
