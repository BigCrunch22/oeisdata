%N A249973 Positive integers A when the positive roots of r^2 = Ar + B are listed in increasing order.
%C A249973 Generalize the Fibonacci sequence recurrence equation as: F_(n+1) = A*F_n + B*F_(n-1), where A and B are positive integers. As n goes to infinity, the ratio F_n / F_(n-1) approaches the positive real number r = (A + sqrt(A*A + 4B))/2. This sequence gives the A values in increasing order of r.
%C A249973 In case of a tie in r values, then sort in increasing order of sqrt(A*A + B*B).
%C A249973 This A sequence appears to be the ordinal transform of the B sequence (A249974) and vice versa. The associative arrays of A and B are transposes. The first row of A's associative array seems to be A006000.
%C A249973 For the A and B values leading to a positive integer limit r see a comment in A063929. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jan 12 2015
%e A249973 a(6) = 2 because the 6th smallest value of r (approximately 2.732050808) is that for A=2, B=2.
