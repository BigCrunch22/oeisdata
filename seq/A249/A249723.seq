%N A249723 Numbers n such that there is a multiple of 9 on row n of Pascal's triangle with property that all multiples of 4 on the same row (if they exist) are larger than it.
%C A249723 All n such that on row n of A095143 (Pascal's triangle reduced modulo 9) there is at least one zero and the distance from the edge to the nearest zero is shorter than the distance from the edge to the nearest zero on row n of A034931 (Pascal's triangle reduced modulo 4), the latter distance taken to be infinite if there are no zeros on that row in the latter triangle.
%C A249723 A052955 from its eight term onward, 31, 47, 63, 95, 127, ... seems to be a subsequence. See also the comments at A249441.

%e A249723 Row 13 of Pascal's triangle (A007318) is: {1, 13, 78, 286, 715, 1287, 1716, 1716, 1287, 715, 286, 78, 13, 1} and the term binomial(13, 5) = 1287 = 9*11*13 occurs before any term which is a multiple of 4. Note that one such term occurs right next to it, as binomial(13, 6) = 1716 = 4*3*11*13, but 1287 < 1716, thus 13 is included.
