%N A249905 Smallest number of vertices supporting a graph with exactly n Hamiltonian cycles up to direction.
%C A249905 "Up to direction" means that cycles differing only in starting vertex or direction of traversal are treated as one cycle. a(n) always exists since the wheel graph on n spokes has n cycles.
