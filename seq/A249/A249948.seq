%N A249948 Gaps between single 1's in the Kolakoski sequence A000002.
%C A249948 Except the first term, equals first difference of A249942.
%C A249948 The only possible values are 3, 5, 6, 9 and 10: a(n) cannot take the value 2, because it would imply the word 21212 which does not appear in the OK sequence; a(n) = 3 with the word 212-212, a(n) = 5 with 212-11-212, a(n) = 6 with 212-211-212 or 212-112-212, a(n) = 9 with 212-211-211-212 or 212-112-112-212, a(n) = 10 with 212-2112112-212. And from this it is easily seen that a(n) and a(n+1) cannot be equal unless a(n) = a(n+1) = 6 with the word 21-21122-1-22112-12.
