%N A249913 Numbers in accordance with alphabet placement on a qwerty keyboard.
%C A249913 On the standard 'qwerty' keyboard, these are the numbers that are vertically in line with the letters of the alphabet, starting with A and continuing with the standard order of the alphabet to Z. Numbers qualify as in line with the number if about 2/3 of the key is in line with the letter. In the case that two numbers are equally in line with a given letter (example: keys 3 and 4 are both equally in line with key E), the sum of the two numbers is taken.
%e A249913 The first term is 2 because most of the A key is in line with 2.
%e A249913 The second term is 6 because most of the B key is in line with 6.
