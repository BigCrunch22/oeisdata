%C A016037 The basis of this sequence is that integers are named without the use of "and". As a minor correction at the time of this comment, therefore, the 31-digit number above beginning 1103 ... should be described as "one nonillion one hundred three octillion ...". If naming is done in accordance with UK English usage ("one hundred", "one hundred and one", ...), the first occurrence of a(n) = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ... is for n = 4, 0, 3, 1, 11, 23, 124, 113373373373, ... _Ian Duff_, Dec 04 2019
