%N A300861 Records in A300858.
%C A300861 Consider numbers in the cototient of n, listed in row n of A121998. For composite n > 4, there are nondivisors m in the cototient, listed in row n of A133995. Of these m, there are two species. The first are m that divide n^e with integer e > 1, while the last do not divide n^e. These are listed in row n of A272618 and A272619, and counted by A243822(n) and A243823(n), respectively. This sequence lists the records in A300858, which is a function that represents the difference between the latter and the former species of nondivisors in the cototient of n.
%e A300861 0 is the first term since A300858(1) = 0. A300858 is 0 or negative for n < 8.
%e A300861 A300858(8) = A243823(8) - A243822(8) = 1 - 0 = 1. Within the cototient of 8 there is one nondivisor (6) and it does not divide 8^e for integer e. (All prime powers m have A243822(m) = 0 and for m > 4, A243823(m) is positive.) Therefore 1 is the next term. Between 8 and 15, -1 <= A300858(n) <= 1.
%e A300861 A300858(15) = 2. Within the cototient of 15 there are 4 nondivisors; of these 3 (i.e., {6, 10, 12}) do not divide 15^e for integer e, but 9 | 15^2. Therefore 3 - 1 = 2 and 2 exceeds all values A300858(n) for n < 15, and appears after 1.
