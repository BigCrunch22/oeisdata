%N A300812 Irregular triangle T(n,c) read by rows: the number of clusters of n spheres centered on f.c.c. lattice sites with c contacts.
%C A300812 Each of the n spheres is centered at a different vertex of the face-centered-cubic lattice.
%C A300812 "Clusters of spheres" means that the (simple, undirected) graph, which has edges for each "bond" where two spheres touch, is connected. The number of contacts equals the number of edges in the graph.
%C A300812 T(n,c) counts "free" clusters, which means that clusters are considered distinct if they cannot be mapped onto each other by one of the 48 symmetries of the octahedral group plus shifts along the directions of the face centers.
%C A300812 Since there are 12 nearest neighbors in the f.c.c. lattice, the degree of each vertex in the contact graph is in the interval [1,12].
%C A300812 T(n,c) = 0 for c < n: the minimum number of contacts is realized with chains of spheres, where the two spheres at the ends have degree 1 and the others degree 2.
%C A300812 The row length of row n of the triangle should equal 1+A214813(n) ... but does not for n=5, see the comment in A214813.

%e A300812 T(2,1) = 1 because there is one cluster with two spheres which touch each other at one point: (0,0,0), (1/2,0,1/2).
%e A300812 T(3,2) = 3 counts three spheres in three different geometries: (i) (0,0,0), (1/2,1/2,0), (1,0,1), linear, (ii) (0,0,0), (1/2,1/2,0), (1,1,0) with 90-degree bond angle, (iii) (0,0,0), (1/2,1/2,0), (1,1/2,1/2) with 120-degree bond angle.
%e A300812 T(3,3) = 1 counts the planar triangular canonball base arrangement: (0,0,0), (1/2,1/2,0), (1/2,0,1/2).
