%N A300024 For any k, the cumulative sum a(1) + a(2) + a(3) + ... + a(k) shows at least a digit 0.
%C A300024 The sequence starts with a(1) = 10 and is always extended with the smallest integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction.
%C A300024 A permutation of the natural numbers.

%e A300024 10 shows at least a digit 0, of course (k = 1)
%e A300024 10 + 20 = 30 and 30 shows at least a digit 0 (k = 2)
%e A300024 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 and 60 shows at least a digit 0 (k = 3)
%e A300024 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 = 100 and 100 shows at least a digit 0 (k = 4)
%e A300024 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 1 = 101 and 101 shows at least a digit 0 (k = 5)
%e A300024 10 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 1 + 2 = 103 and 103 shows at least a digit 0 (k = 6)

%Y A300024 Cf. A300015 (which is the lexicographic first sequence of positive integers without duplicate terms having this property).
