%N A300360 Number of ways to write n^2 as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers and z <= w such that x or y is a power of 2 (including 1) and x + 63*y = 2^(2k+1) for some k = 0,1,2,....
%C A300360 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 1, and a(n) = 1 only for n = 5, 13, 25, 29, 59, 61, 79, 91, 95, 101, 103, 1315, 2^k (k = 1,2,3,...), 2^(2k+1)*m (k = 0,1,2,... and m = 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23).
%C A300360 Note the difference between the current sequence and A300356.
%C A300360 In the comments of A300219, the author conjectured that a positive square n^2 can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers such that both x and x + 3*y are powers of 4 unless n has the form 4^k*81503 with k a nonnegative integer. Since 81503^2 = 208^2 + 16^2 + 51167^2 + 63440^2 with 16 = 4^2 and 208 + 3*16 = 4^4, this implies that any positive square can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers such that x or y is a power of 4 and x + 3y is also a power of 4. We also conjecture that for any positive integer n not of the form 4^k*m (k =0,1,... and m = 2, 7) we can write n^2 as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers such that x or y is a power of 4 and x + 2*y is also a power of 4.

%e A300360 a(38) = 1 since 38^2 = 2^2 + 0^2 + 12^2 + 36^2 with 2 = 2^1 and 2 + 63*0 = 2^1.
