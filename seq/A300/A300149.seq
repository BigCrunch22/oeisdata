%N A300149 Terms from A300148 that disappear, according to the "Erase or triple" protocol (see the Crossref section).
%C A300149 The "Erase or triple" protocol describes how to transform an integer K into an integer L: if K has 2 or more identical digits, erase them to get L (1201331 becomes 20); if K has no duplicate digits, triple K to get L (20 becomes 60). Some integers disappear immediately (like 1100 or 9191), other disappear if you apply this protocol to the successive results. This sequence gathers them all.
%C A300149 Note that 1102 is transformed into 2 because no leading zeroes are admitted.

%e A300149 2 becomes 6 (the triple of 2), then 6 becomes 18 (the triple of 6), then 18 becomes 54 (the triple of 18) and now 162, 486, 1458, 4374, 37 (because the pair 4-4 is erased), 111 (the triple of 37), ... and disappearance.
%Y A300149 Cf. A300148 which shows the first integer (1) entering into a loop.
