%N A300444 The minimal number of steps that a path-avoiding snail must take in order to have a step of length (2n-1)/2^k for some k.
%C A300444 The path-avoiding snail takes steps of unit length if doing so does not cause it to collide with its trail. If a unit length step would cause a collision, it travels halfway to its trail. After every step the snail may turn left or right or remain straight.
