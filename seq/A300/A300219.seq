%N A300219 Number of ways to write n^2 as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers and z <= w such that both x and 4*x - 3*y are powers of 4 (including 4^0 = 1).
%C A300219 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 0, and a(n) = 1 only for n = 4^k*m (k = 0,1,2,... and m = 1, 2, 3, 5, 15, 37, 83, 263). Also, for each n = 2,3,... we can write n^2 as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers such that both x and 4*x - 3*y lie in the set {2^(2k+1): k = 0,1,...}.
%C A300219 (ii) Let r be 0 or 1, and let n > r. Then n^2 can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers such that both x and x + 3*y belong to the set {2^(2k+r): k = 0,1,2,...}, unless n has the form 2^(2k+r)*81503 with k a nonnegative integer and hence n^2 = (2^(2k+r)*28^2)^2 + (2^(2k+r)*80)^2 + (2^(2k+r)*55937)^2 + (2^(2k+r)*59272)^2 with 2^(2k+r)*28^2 = 2^r*(2^k*28)^2 and 2^(2k+r)*28^2 + 3*(2^(2k+r)*80) = 2^(2(k+5)+r). So we always can write n^2 as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers such that x/2^r is a square and (x+3*y)/2^r is a power of 4.
%C A300219 In arXiv:1701.05868 the author proved that for each r = 0,1 and n > r we can write n^2 as (2^(2k+r))^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 with k,x,y,z nonnegative integers.
%C A300219 We have verified both parts of the conjecture for n up to 10^7.
