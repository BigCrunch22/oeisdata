%N A300531 Matching number of the n-polygon diagonal intersection graph.
%C A300531 Conjecturally, a matching exists for every n with at most one unmatched vertex. This would imply a(n) = floor(A007569(n)/2). A computer search, using a simple nonbacktracking algorithm, has shown the existence of such matchings up to n = 22 and indeed for small n there are large numbers of maximum matchings (A292921). Such a matching could also be constructed from a Hamiltonian path (A300551) by selecting every other edge, so a proof that these graphs are Hamiltonian would also suffice. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Mar 12 2018
