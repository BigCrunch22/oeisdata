%N A300670 Table read by antidiagonals: the n-th row is the lexicographically earliest sequence such that no k + 2 points of ((1, a(1)), (2, a(2)), ...) lie on a polynomial of degree k for k < n.
%C A300670 Is every row a permutation of the natural numbers?
%C A300670 The first row is the positive integers, the second row is A231334, and the main diagonal is A300002.
%C A300670 T(n, m) = A300002(m) for n >= m, thus the rows converge to A300002 in the limit.
