%N A300795 Number of vertices of the master corner polyhedron on the cyclic group of order n + 1.
%C A300795 The master corner polyhedron P(G_{n+1},n) on the additive cyclic group G_{n+1} of order n+1 (with addition modulo n+1) is the convex hull of solutions t=(t_1,t_2,..,t_n) in R^n, t_i integer, t_i >= 0, to the equation t_1 + 2*t_2 + ... + n*t_n == n (mod (n+1)).
%C A300795 The master corner polyhedron P(G,g_0) was defined by R. E. Gomory for an arbitrary finite Abelian group G and arbitrary group element g_0. It is of great importance for integer linear programming.
%C A300795 R. E. Gomory computed vertices of P(G,g_0) for all groups G of the order up to 11 and all g_0 in G.
%C A300795 The point t=(0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,0) was erroneously indicated to be a vertex of P(G_11,10).
%C A300795 a(11)-a(21) were computed with the use of the Parma Polyhedra Library [(PPL)]. - _Dominic Yang_, Oct 04 2018

%e A300795 The 6 integer points in the convex hull of the vertices of P(G_5,4) are (4,0,0,0), (2,1,0,0), (1,0,1,0), (0,2,0,0), (0,0,3,0), (0,0,0,1) but a(4) = 5 since (2,1,0,0) = (1/2)(4,0,0,0) + (1/2)(0,2,0,0).
%Y A300795 Similar to A203898.
