%N A300004 First differences of the list A292794 of numbers not congruent to F(k) modulo F(k+1) for any k > 1, where F are the Fibonacci numbers A000045.
%C A300004 The sequence has been chosen 0-indexed, as for A292794.
%C A300004 It has been conjectured that every even number occurs in this sequence.
%C A300004 It would be interesting to know whether there are patterns or formulae for the indices at which the respective even numbers occur.
%C A300004 The index of the first occurrence of 2n in this sequence is listed in A300004 = (1, 0, 5, 26, 14, ...): a(1), a(0), a(5), a(26), a(14), ... is the first occurrence of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ... in this sequence.
%F A300004 a(n) = A292794(n+1) - A292794(n).
