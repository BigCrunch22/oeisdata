%N A300154 Consider a spiral on an infinite hexagonal grid. a(n) is the number of cells in the part of the spiral from 1st to n-th cell that are on the same column or diagonal (in any of three directions) as the n-th cell along the spiral, including that cell itself.
%C A300154 A138099 and A280026 are analogs for the square grid. - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Mar 05 2018

%e A300154 a(3) = 3 because the third hexagon is on the same diagonal as itself, the second hexagon, and the original hexagon.
%e A300154 a(7) = 5 because the 7th cell is on the same columns/diagonals as cells No. 2 (in one direction), 6 (in another direction), 1 and 4 (in the third direction), plus itself.
