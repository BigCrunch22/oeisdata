%N A300155 Numbers n for which A243822(n) = A000005(n).
%C A300155 Indices of zeros in A299990, i.e., A010846(n) - 2*A000005(n) = 0.
%C A300155 Composite numbers m have nondivisors k in the cototient such that k | n^e with e > 1. These k appear in row n of A272618 and are enumerated by A243822(n). These nondivisors k are a kind of "regular" number along with divisors d of n; both are listed in row n of A162306 and are together enumerated by A045763(n). Divisors of n are listed in row n of A027750.
%C A300155 This sequence lists numbers that have an equal number of nondivisors k in the cototient of n as divisors d.
%C A300155 The smallest odd term is 105.
