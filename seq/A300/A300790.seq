%N A300790 Numbers k the smallest solution of A023900(m) = s, m >= 1, s <> 0, such that A023900(k) is negative and k is nonprime.
%C A300790 The least solutions of A023900(m) = -s contains the sequence A000040. The union of this sequence and A000040 make up all of the least solutions of A023900(n) = -s.
%C A300790 Terms of this sequence are the product of an odd number of prime factors.
%C A300790 A000010(a(n)) is nonsquarefree, for n >= 1.
%C A300790 Every a(n) is one part of a pair (a(n), x) where A023900(x) = -A023900(a(n)) and x is the least solution of A023900(m) = s, and A023900(x) is positive. Where this is the case A000010(x) = A000010(a(n)).
%F A300790 A000010(a(n)) + A023900(a(n)) = 0.
%F A300790 tau(a(n)) mod 8 = 0.
%e A300790 30 is a term as it is the least solution to A023900(m) = -8 and is nonprime.
%e A300790 66 is a term as it is the least solution to A023900(m) = -20 and is nonprime.
%e A300790 4 is not a term since A023900(4) = -1, and the smallest solution of A023909(m) = -1 is 2 and is prime.
