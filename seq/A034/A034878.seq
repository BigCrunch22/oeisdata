%N A034878 Numbers k such that k! can be written as the product of smaller factorials.
%C A034878 Except for the numbers 2, 9 and 10 this sequence is conjectured to be the same as A001013.
%C A034878 Every r! is a member for r>2, for (r!)! = (r!)*(r!-1)!. - _Amarnath Murthy_, Sep 11 2002
%C A034878 By Murthy's trick, if k>2 is a product of factorials then k is a term. So half of the above conjecture is true: A001013 is a subsequence except for the number 2. - _Jonathan Sondow_, Nov 08 2004
%C A034878 If there exists another term of this sequence not also in A001013, it must be >= 100000. - _Charlie Neder_, Oct 07 2018
%C A034878 An additional term of this sequence not in A001013 must be > 5000000. Can it be shown that no such terms exist using results on consecutive smooth numbers? - _Charlie Neder_, Jan 14 2019
