%N A034919 Minimal consecutive determinant (negated) of n X n persymmetric matrix with entries {-1,0,+1}.
%C A034919 A persymmetric (or Hankel) matrix has M[ i,j ] = M[ i-k,j+k ] for all i and j (matrix is constant along antidiagonals).
%C A034919 I would love to find out what "consecutive" means here! Adjacent entries along the top row and right side must be consecutive? - _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 16 2003
%C A034919 Interpretation: largest m such that for each d for which -m <= d <= 0 a matrix with determinant d exists. - _Bert Dobbelaere_, Jan 26 2019
%Y A034919 Cf. A034917, A034918, A034920, A034921.
