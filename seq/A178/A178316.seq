%N A178316 Primes with the property that their digital rotation is still prime.
%C A178316 This means if written as in a digital clock and rotated 180 degrees around the center the result is also prime (possibly a different prime).
%D A178316 Guy, R. K., Unsolved Problems in Number Theory, p 15 This sequence is related to the palindromic primes with symmetries as in Guy's book.
