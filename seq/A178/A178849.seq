%N A178849 n-th integer having n-th prime-containing prime signature.
%C A178849 This sequence forms the diagonal of the table (A095904) containing all of the integers >= 2, ordered by prime signature.
%C A178849 The first row of the table is A025487 (starting with n=2),
%C A178849 The first column of the table is the primes (A000040).
%C A178849 The description for this sequence specifies "prime-containing" to exclude the prime signature for 1, which is also excluded from A095904.
%e A178849 The 5th prime-containing prime signature (i.e. excluding the prime signature for 1) is {1,2}.
%e A178849 The 5th integer to have that prime signature is 44 (see A054753 for a list).
%e A178849 Therefore a(5) is 44.
%Y A178849 Cf. A025487, A000040, A095904.
