%N A178461 Integers whose binary digits "1" define, iff these integers are not decreased by one, Arimaa pieces of both colors so that an enemy piece can be removable in all possible color combinations in one turn (= 4 steps) if sorted into a quadrant shape whose right angle lies in an Arimaa board corner.

%e A178461 168 has the binary expansion 10101000. Sorting into a quadrant shape (like in A165197, A166537, the least-significant digit into the corner) with a "T" on position (3,3) leads to:
%e A178461 001
%e A178461 00
%e A178461 11T
%e A178461 0
%e A178461 Either the left piece pushes to right or the upper piece comes down and pushes in a right angle. So in both possible color combinations an enemy piece can be brought into the trap field "T". The following integers till 174 bring for possible removabilities sufficiently movable pieces into the 4 vacant corner fields.
