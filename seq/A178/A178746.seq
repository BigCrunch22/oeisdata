%N A178746 Binary counter with intermittent bits. Starting at zero the counter attempts to increment by 1 at each step but each bit in the counter alternately accepts and rejects requests to toggle.
%C A178746 A simple scatter plot reveals a self-similar structure that resembles flying geese.
%C A178746 Ignoring the initial zero term, split the sequence into rows of increasing binary magnitude such that the terms in row m satisfy 2^m <= a(n) < 2^(m+1).
