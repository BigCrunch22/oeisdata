%N A178176 a(n) is the number of central quotients of simple compact Lie groups of dimension n
%e A178176 a(3) = 2 since the 3-dimensional SU(2) has two central quotients: SU(2) and SU(2)/2 = SO(3).
%e A178176 The unusually large value a(78) = 6 is due to the simple Lie groups Spin(13), Sp(6), and E_6 each of dimension 78 and each having two central quotients.
