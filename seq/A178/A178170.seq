%N A178170 The product of the numbers in the Collatz trajectory of a(n) is the n-th largest such product.
%C A178170 That is, a(n) is the number k such that A178168(k) = A178169(n).
%C A178170 The sequence is easy to compute by generating the Collatz tree while keeping track of the products at the leaves of the tree. At each step, extend the tree at the leaf having the smallest product.
