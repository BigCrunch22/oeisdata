%N A178408 Triangle T(n,k) read by rows. Each column is the Mobius function "recurrence" with the previous column as input.
%C A178408 The title says "recurrence" in quotes because the Mobius function does not have a regular recurrence. Row sums are A008683. Number of nonzero elements in the rows are A086436 which is essentially the same as A001222. Each row is a row in a Pascal like triangle.
