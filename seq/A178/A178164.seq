%N A178164 Decimal expansion of the largest arbitrarily-long Type-2 Trott-like constant (see A178160 for definition).
%C A178164 For n=1,2,..., the largest n-digit numbers in A178160 are 9, 99, 991, 9919, etc., so a(1)=9, a(2)=9, a(3)=1, a(4)=9, etc.
%C A178164 The number of digits of agreement increases as more digits are used, but the ratio (digits of agreement divided by digits used) is between 0.31 and 0.32 when the number of digits used is between a few hundred and a few thousand; this rate of convergence is not nearly as good as that of the second Trott constant (A091694).
