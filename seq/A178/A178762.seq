%N A178762 Prime numbers that are Fibonacci integers.
%C A178762 A Fibonacci integer is a number that can be written as the product and/or quotient of Fibonacci numbers (A000045). For example, 107 is a Fibonacci integer because Fib(36)/(Fib(18)*Fib(3)*Fib(4)^3) = 107. Observe that the prime Fibonacci numbers (A005478) are a subset of these primes. Luca, Pomerance, and Wagner conjecture that this sequence is infinite. The paper's Remark 2 and sequences A152012, A178763, and A178764 are useful in finding these primes.
