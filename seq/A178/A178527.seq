%N A178527 Primes p such that either p - 2 or p + 2 has more than two distinct prime divisors.
%C A178527 Sequence contains "many" pairs of cousin primes. More exactly, our conjectures are: (1) sequence contains almost all cousin primes; (2)for x >= 107, c(x)/A(x) > C(x)/pi(x), where A(x), c(x) and C(x) are the counting functions for this sequence, cousin pairs in this sequence and all cousin pairs respectively.
%C A178527 Indeed (a heuristic argument), a number n in the middle of a randomly chosen pair of cousin primes may be considered as a random integer.
%C A178527 The probability that n has no more than two prime divisors is, as well known, O((log(log n)/log n), i.e., it is natural to conjecture that almost all cousin pairs are in the sequence. Furthermore, it is natural to conjecture that the inequality is true as well, since A(x) < pi(x).
%C A178527 Probably this sequence contains almost all primes and so a(n) ~ n log n. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Sep 24 2013
