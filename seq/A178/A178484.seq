%N A178484 For n=1,2,... list all numbers not occurring earlier which can be written as a product of the first n primes raised to some nonnegative power less than n.
%C A178484 A condensed version of sequence A178483.
%C A178484 Every positive integer occurs exactly once in this sequence, but depending on its largest prime factor, it may appear later than much larger numbers. E.g. 7=a(29) appears after a(28)=900, and 11=a(257) appears only after a(256)=9261000.
%C A178484 The first n^n terms are the divisors of n#^(n-1), so any term divisible by the k-th prime must appear later than position (k-1)^(k-1). - _Charlie Neder_, Mar 08 2019
