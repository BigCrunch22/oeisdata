%N A178492 Primitive elements of A006532, i.e., which are not product of earlier terms (> 1) in that sequence.
%C A178492 If a,b are coprime elements of A006532, their product is again in A006532. But there are some a,b which are not coprime and still a,b,a*b are in A006532: First examples are 820*{2860, 3340, 8580, 10020, 11620, ...}.

%e A178492 The terms a(2)=3 and a(3)=22 are coprime elements of A006532, therefore 3*22=66 is a non-primitive element of A006532, and not listed in this sequence.
