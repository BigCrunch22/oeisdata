%N A178502 Numbers n such that prime(n) modulo n is less than n/2.
%C A178502 The sequence consists largely of long runs of consecutive integers. However, there are also a few isolated integers such that the distance to both neighbor terms is greater than 1: 21, 69, 181, 1052, 4137, 4142, 6466, 63424, 100362.
%e A178502 1 is a term because prime(1) mod 1 = 2 mod 1 = 0 < 1/2; 5 is a term because prime(5) mod 5 = 11 mod 5 = 1 < 5/2; 6 is a term because prime(6) mod 6 = 13 mod 6 = 1 < 6/2.
