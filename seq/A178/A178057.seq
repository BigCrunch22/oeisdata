%N A178057 Smallest prime number > a(n-1) that contains the n-th semiprime number as a substring.
%C A178057 Not to be confused with smallest semiprime number > a(n-1) that contains the n-th prime number as a substring. This is the 2nd row of an infinite array A[k,n] = Smallest k-almost prime number > a(n-1) that contains the n-th prime number as a substring. This is one plane of the infinite 3-D array A[j,k,n] = Smallest k-almost prime number > a(n-1) that contains the n-th prime number as a substring in base j representation.
%F A178057 a(n) = MIN{p > a(n-1) in A000040 such that A001358(n) as a string of decimal digits is a substring of p as a string of decimal digits}.
%e A178057 a(1) = 41 because 41 is the smallest prime whose decimal representation has "4" as a substring, and 4 = 2*2 is the 1st (smallest) semiprime (number of the form p*q where p and q are primes, not necessarily distinct).
%e A178057 a(2) = 61 because 61 is the smallest prime whose decimal representation has "6" as a substring, and 6 = 2*3 is the 2nd semiprime.
%e A178057 a(3) = 79 because 79 is the smallest prime > 61 whose decimal representation has "9" as a substring, and 9 = 3*3 is the 3rd semiprime.
%Y A178057 Cf. A000040, A001358, A144565, A169798.
