%N A178850 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence such that (a(i)-a(j)) mod (a(k)-a(j)) is nonzero whenever i,j,k are disjoint.
%C A178850 First infinite picket-fence sequence: a picket fence extended from any pair in the set encounters no other member of the set.
%C A178850 Terms in this sequence gradually become restricted in increasing moduli. From a(7) on, all terms are == 4 (mod 12).
%e A178850 From the initial 1,3, no further terms can be odd. After 3,6, no further multiples of 3 are possible. After 1,3,6, an 8 would be legal, except that no further extension of the sequence is then possible.
