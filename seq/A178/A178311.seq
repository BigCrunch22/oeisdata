%N A178311 Davis's upper bound for span(P^m x P^111) with m = 3 * (2^n - 1) for 5 <= n <= 17, and P^k denoting real projective space.
%C A178311 From Table 3.2, p.10, of Davis. The span of a manifold is its maximum number of linearly independent vector fields. We discuss the question, still unresolved, of whether span(P^m x P^n) always equals span(P^m) + span(P^n). Here P^n denotes real projective space. We use BP-cohomology to obtain new upper bounds for span(P^m x P^n), much stronger than previously known bounds.
