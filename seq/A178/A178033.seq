%N A178033 Lesser of a twin prime pair (p,p+2) such that permuting the digits of p and those of p+2 gives a different twin prime pair (q, q+2).
%C A178033 Permutations with initial zeros are disallowed, so that 101 is not a member (101,103 and 11,13); equivalently, we require that p is a permutation of the digits of q as well.
%e A178033 281 is a member as 281 is the lesser of the twin prime pair 281,283, and after permuting 821, 823 is also a twin prime pair.
