%N A178760 Number of tests performed to find the n-th term of the EKG sequence A064413.
%C A178760 In the EKG sequence, to find the n-th term, we test each larger number not already in the sequence, looking for one that has a factor in common with previous term. The first two terms are zero because the first two terms of the EKG sequence are given. The odd primes appear in the EKG sequence where a(n) = 1. See A178761 for the cumulative number of tests.
