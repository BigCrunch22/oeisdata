%N A178668 Maximal prime divisor of the average of the twin prime pairs, different from 2 and 3. In case of maximal prime divisor is 2 or 3, then a(n)=1.
%C A178668 78 from the first 100 terms are first or second members of twin pairs and only 12 are not. In a natural supposition that for large prime terms the latter should be in the majority, there are reasons to assume that the number N for which it occurs for the first time is very large.
%C A178668 The average of a twin-prime pair is the same as 1 + the lower twin prime, whose largest prime factor is tabulated in A060210.
