%N A178903 n-th decimal digit of the fractional part of the square root of the n-th semiprime.
%C A178903 This is to semiprimes A001358 as A071901 is to prime A000040. Regarded as a decimal fraction, 0.0402536505356781... is likely to be an irrational number.
%e A178903 semiprime(1) = 4, sqrt(4) = 2.000, first digit of fractional part is 0, so a(1) = 0.
%e A178903 semiprime(2) = 6, sqrt(6) = 2.449, 2nd digit of fractional part is 4, so a(2) = 4.
%e A178903 semiprime(3) = 9, sqrt(9) = 3.000, 3rd digit of fractional part is 0, so a(3) = 0.
%e A178903 semiprime(4) = 10, sqrt(10) = 3.162277, 4th digit of fractional part is 2, so a(4) = 2.
%e A178903 semiprime(5) = 14, sqrt(14) = 3.741657, 5th digit of fractional part is 5, so a(5) = 5.
%e A178903 semiprime(6) = 15, sqrt(15) = 3.8729833, 6th digit of fractional part is 3, so a(6) = 3 semiprime(7) = 21, sqrt(21) = 4.58257569, 7th digit of fractional part is 6, so a(6) = 6.
