%N A178007 Largest n-digit prime with the most digits equal to 9.
%C A178007 First maximum the number of 9's, then choose the largest.
%C A178007 From _Robert Israel_, Dec 18 2024: (Start)
%C A178007 This is believed to be different from A241206, as there should be infinitely many n for which there is no n-digit prime with n-1 digits equal to 9.  No examples are known; the least such n is greater than 3400. (End)
