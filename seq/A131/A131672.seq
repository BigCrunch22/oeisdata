%N A131672 a(n) is the smallest k >= 1 such that the expansion of the inverse of the k-th cyclotomic polynomial has n or -n as a coefficient, or -1 if no such k exists.
%C A131672 Moree's abstract: "Let Psi_n(x) be the monic polynomial having precisely all nonprimitive n-th roots of unity as its simple zeros. One has Psi_n(x) = (x^n-1)/Phi_n(x), with Phi_n(x) the n-th cyclotomic polynomial. The coefficients of Psi_n(x) are integers that like the coefficients of Phi_n(x) tend to be surprisingly small in absolute value, e.g. for n<561 all coefficients of Psi_n(x) are <= 1 in absolute value. We establish various properties of the coefficients of Psi_n(x).
%C A131672 From _Jianing Song_, May 26 2021: (Start)
%C A131672 The old name was "Arises in reciprocal cyclotomic polynomials".
%C A131672 Since 1/Phi_n(x) = -Psi_n(x) * (1 + x^n + x^(2n) + ...), the period length of coefficients in the expansion of 1/Phi_n(x) is n.
%C A131672 For n > 1, a(n) is odd, composite and squarefree.
%C A131672 Conjecture 1: a(n) > 0 exists for all n.
%C A131672 Conjecture 2: for every k > 2, there exists some positive integer m such that the coefficients in the expansion of 1/Phi_k(x) are -m, -(m-1), ..., m-1, m. If this is true, then for n > 1, a(n) is also the smallest k such that the expansion of 1/Phi_k(x) has both n and -n as coefficients, and a(n) is also the smallest k such that the expansion of 1/Phi_k(x) has a coefficient whose absolute value is greater than or equal to n. (End)
%C A131672 So far, all terms k > 1 have the property that k is squarefree with omega(k) > 2. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Jun 09 2021
