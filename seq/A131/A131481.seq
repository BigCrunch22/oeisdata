%N A131481 a(n) is the number of n-cell polyiamonds (triangular polyominoes) with perimeter n+2.
%C A131481 n+2 is the maximal perimeter for an n-celled polyiamond. a(n) is the number of n-celled polyiamonds that have a tree as their connectedness graph (vertices of this graph correspond to cells and two vertices are connected if the corresponding cells have a common edge)
