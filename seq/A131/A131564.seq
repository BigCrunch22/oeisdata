%N A131564 Let spm(n) be the sum of all prime factors of n counted with multiplicities (A001414); sequence gives numbers n such that spm(n+spm(n)) divides both n and n+spm(n).
%e A131564 Take 60, having sum of prime factors 2+2+3+5=12 and add that 12 to 60 to get 72, having the sum of its prime factors 2+2+2+3+3=12. We see that this 12 divides both 60 and 72.
%e A131564 For 2408, the sum of prime factors is 2+2+2+7+43=56, added to 2408 gives 2464, with sum of prime factors being 2+2+2+2+2+7+11=28; this 28 divides both 2408 and 2464.
