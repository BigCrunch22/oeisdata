%N A131480 Minimal set of prime-strings in Roman numerals.
%C A131480 Written in Roman numerals this sequence begins II, V, XI, LIX, CI, DIX, MIX, MLI, MMMI.
%C A131480 For a while I actually considered putting in 97 (XCVII) instead of 101 (CI), since XCVII contains CI as a substring. But it also contains II, V and XI as substrings, so going in order strictly from smallest to greatest, 97 must be excluded.
%e A131480 a(4) = 59 because it is a prime number and in Roman numerals it's written LIX (all the substrings are composite or not prime: L, LI, LX, I, IX, X).
%Y A131480 Cf. A071062, minimal set of prime-strings in base 10.
