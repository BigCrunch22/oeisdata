%N A131232 a(n) = number of positive integers < n which don't have 2 or more distinct prime divisors in common with n.
%e A131232 The distinct primes which divide 20 are 2 and 5. So a(20) is the number of positive integers < 20 which are not divisible by at least 2 distinct primes dividing 20; i.e. are not divisible by both 2 and 5. Among the first 19 positive integers only 10 is divisible by both 2 and 5. There are 18 other positive integers <= 19, so a(20)=18.
