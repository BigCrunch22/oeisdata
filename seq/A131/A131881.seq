%N A131881 Complement of A116700. Might be called "punctual birds".
%C A131881 Numbers n that do not occur in the concatenation of 1,2,3...,n-1.
%C A131881 Every power of 10 is a member, which proves that the sequence is infinite. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jul 23 2007
%C A131881 The asymptotic density of the sequence is zero. The number of k-digit terms is A132133 = (9, 45, 270, 2104, ...), k = 1, 2, .... These are the first difference of the indices of powers of 10, T = (1, 10, 55, 325, 2429, ...), which we get as partial sums if we prefix A132133(0) = 1 corresponding to the number 0. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 24 2019
%H A131881 M. F. Hasler, <a href="/A131881/b131881.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..2428</a>
%e A131881 The first number not in this sequence is the early bird "12" which occurs as concatenation of 1 and 2.
