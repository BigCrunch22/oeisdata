%N A131937 a(1)=1; a(2)=4, a(n) = a(n-1) + (n-th positive integer which does not occur in sequence A131938).
%C A131937 Conjecture: Starting with any infinite positive integer sequence A1(n) whose complement is also infinite, let B1(n) be the sequence of partial sums of the complement of sequence A1. Let A2(n) be the sequence of partial sums of the complement of sequence B1. Iteratively let B[k](n) be the sequence of partial sums of the complement of sequence A[k], and let A[k+1](n) be the sequence of partial sums of the complement of sequence B[k]. Call the stable iterative limit sequences A(n) and B(n), which are universal and do not depend upon the initial sequence A1(n). These two limiting sequences are conjectured to be A131938 and this A131937. - _Gregory Gerard Wojnar_, Dec 12 2024
