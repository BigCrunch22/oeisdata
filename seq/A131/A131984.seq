%N A131984 Where records occur in A106708.
%C A131984 Numbers n such that concatenation of proper divisors of n exceeds that of all smaller numbers. Empty concatenation is regarded as 0.
%C A131984 Sequence has many terms in common with A034090 (numbers n such that sum of proper divisors of n exceeds that of all smaller numbers), A034287 (numbers n such that product of divisors of n is larger than for any number less than n), A034288 (product of proper divisors is larger than for any smaller number), A067128 (Ramanujan's largely composite numbers, defined to be n such that d(n) >= d(k) for k = 1 to n-1).
