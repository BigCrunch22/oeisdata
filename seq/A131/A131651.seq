%N A131651 Positive integers obtained as the difference of two triangular numbers in exactly 4 ways.
%C A131651 It appears that terms of the sequence are all given by a power of 2 times the cube of an odd prime or a power of 2 times a product of two distinct odd primes. (This has been verified for a(n) <= 10000.)
%C A131651 Apparently the integers that have exactly 4 odd divisors. (Verified for a(n) <= 187.) - _Philippe Beaudoin_, Oct 24 2013
%C A131651 Also numbers that can be expressed as the sum of k > 1 consecutive positive integers in exactly 3 ways; e.g., 7+8 = 15, 4+5+6 = 15 and 1+2+3+4+5 = 15. - _Julie Jones_, Aug 13 2018

%e A131651 15 is in the sequence because 15 = 15 - 0 = 21 - 6 = 36 - 21 = 120 - 105, where all operands are triangular, and in no other way.
