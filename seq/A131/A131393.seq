%N A131393 Conjectured permutation of the positive integers using Rule 2 with a(1)=1.
%C A131393 Conjecture 1: a( ) is a permutation of the positive integers. Conjecture 2: d( ) is a permutation of the integers. The sequence using Rule 1 ("negative before positive") is A131388.
%C A131393 This sequence was generated using "Rule 2" in a computer program which been lost. The wording of "Rule 2" in the Formula section, although flawed, is retained in case someone can rediscover "Rule 2" and contribute a corrected version. - _Clark Kimberling_, May 18 2015

%F A131393 The following version of "Rule 2" is defective; see Comments. - _Clark Kimberling_, May 18 2015
%F A131393 Rule 2 ("positive before negative"): define sequences d( ) and a( ) as follows: d(1)=0, a(1)=1 and for n>=2, d(n) is the least positive integer d such that a(n-1)+d is not among a(1), a(2),...,a(n-1), or, if no such d exists, then d(n) is the greatest negative integer d such that a(n-1)+d is not among a(1), a(2),...,a(n-1). Then a(n)=a(n-1)+d.
%e A131393 a(2)=1+1, a(3)=a(2)+2, a(4)=a(3)+(-1), a(5)=a(4)+3, a(6)=a(5)+4.
%e A131393 The first term that differs from A131388 is a(28)=42.
