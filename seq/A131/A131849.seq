%N A131849 Cardinality of largest subset of {1,...,n} such that the difference between any two elements of the subset is never one less than a prime.
%C A131849 From the abstract of Ruzsa & Sanders: Suppose that A is a subset of {1,...,N} is such that the difference between any two elements of A is never one less than a prime. We show that |A| = O(N exp(-c(log N)^(1/4))) for some absolute c>0.

%e A131849 a(4) = 2 because {1,4} is the unique subset of {1,2,3,4} with the desired property that 4-1 = 3 is not 1 less than a prime.
%e A131849 a(9) = 3 because {1,4,9} is the unique subset of {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} with the desired property that 4-1 = 3 is not 1 less than a prime and 9-1 = 8 is not 1 less than a prime and 9-4 = 5 is not 1 less than a prime.
%e A131849 For n=9, 10 and 11, the cardinality is limited to 3 (the subset {1,4,9}). For 12 <= n <= 17, the cardinality is limited to 4 (the subset {1,4,9,12}).
