%N A131309 Rabbit-like sequence for phi^2.
%C A131309 The terms given can be computed as the iterates of the morphism 1 -> 110, 0 -> 10, with axiom 1, concatenated. - _Joerg Arndt_, Mar 01 2022
%C A131309 Ratio of 1's to 0's tends to phi^2, by way of example, in the subset of 8 terms (1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0), there are five 1's and three 0's.
%C A131309 Subsets have A001906: (1, 3, 8, 21, ...) terms, being partial sums of A027941: (1, 4, 12, 33, ...). After 33 total terms, there are (1 + 3 + 8) zeros and (1 + 2 + 5 + 13) = 21 ones; with the ratio of ones to zeros tending to phi^2 = 2.618...
%F A131309 Substitution rules T => 2T = t; t => T + t; are derived directly from the matrix generator [2,1; 1,0] (eigenvalue phi^2). Then substitute 1 for T and 0 for t.
%e A131309 By rows, we get:
%e A131309   1;
%e A131309   1, 1, 0;
%e A131309   1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0;
%e A131309   ...
%e A131309 Then append n-th row to the end of (n-1)-th row, forming a continuous string.
%Y A131309 Cf. A027941, A001906, A104457 (phi^2).
