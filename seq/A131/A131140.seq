%N A131140 Counts 3-wild partitions. In general p-wild partitions of n are defined so that they are in bijection with geometric equivalence classes of degree n algebra extensions of the p-adic field Q_p. Here two algebra extensions are equivalent if they become isomorphic after tensoring with the maximal unramified extension of Q_p.
%C A131140 In general, the number of p-wild partitions of n is equal to the number of partitions of n if and only if n<p. From n=p onward, there are many more p-wild partitions.

%F A131140 The generating function is Product_{j>=0} theta_3(2^((3^j-1)/2)*x)^(3^j) where theta_3(y) is the generating function for 3-cores A033687. [This appears to be incorrect - _Joerg Arndt_, Apr 06 2013]
%e A131140 a(3) = 9, since there are four quadratic algebras over Q_3 up to geometric equivalence, namely the unramified algebra Q_3 times Q_3 times Q_3, the tamely ramified algebras Q_3 times Q_3[x]/(x^2-3) and two, two and three wildly ramified algebras with discriminants 3^3, 3^4 and 3^5 respectively.
