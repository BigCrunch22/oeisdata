%N A131512 Iterated golden sieve: Iterate indefinitively the procedure giving A099267 (S2) from the natural numbers (S1) with the single difference that the rank of the deleted terms is f(n) + (p-2) to get Sp from Sp-1.
%e A131512 S1 = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,_,9,10,11,12,13,
%e A131512 S2 = A099267 = 2,3,5,6,8,10,11,13,14,16,18
%e A131512 S3: in S2 (3-2)+f(1)=3, then 5 is deleted, remaining 2,3,6,8,10,11,13,14,16,18
%e A131512 in this remaining sequence (3-2)+f(2)=4, then 8 is deleted, leaving 2,3,6,10,11,13,14,16,18
%e A131512 ....
%e A131512 The first two terms of S2 are definitively safe. It's the same for the first three of S3, and so on;
%e A131512 Iterating indefinitely the procedure produces the sequence: 2,3,6,11,18,27,39,53,69,81,87,113 where the first p terms are already the first p terms of Sp and all following sequences.
%Y A131512 Cf. A099267.
