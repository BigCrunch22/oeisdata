%N A131371 Number of anagrams of n that are semiprimes.
%C A131371 An anagram of a k-digit number is one of the k! permutations of the digits that does not begin with 0. This is to semiprimes A001358 as A046810 is to primes A000040.
%e A131371 a(123) = 3 because 123 = 3 * 41 is semiprime, 213 = 3 * 71 is semiprime, 321 = 3 * 107 is semiprime, while the other anagrams 132, 231 and 312 have respectively 3, 3 and 5 prime factors with multiplicity.
%e A131371 a(129) = 4 because 129 = 3 * 43 is semiprime, 219 = 3 * 73 is semiprime, 291 = 3 * 97 is semiprime, 921 = 3 * 307 is semiprime, while 192 and 912 have 7 and 6 prime factors with multiplicity.
%e A131371 a(134) = 5 because 134 = 2 * 67 and 143 = 11 * 13 and 314 = 2 * 157 and 341 = 11 * 31 and 413 = 7 * 59 are semiprimes, while 431 is prime.
%Y A131371 Cf. A000040, A001358, A002113, A046810, A097393.
