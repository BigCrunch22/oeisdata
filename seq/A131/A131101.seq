%N A131101 Numbers that when added it to their prime factors +1 the result is a prime number, member of A131102.
%C A131101 The Sophie Germain prime numbers (A005384) are part of this sequence because when adding to one of them its only prime factor (itself) + 1 = 2*A005384 + 1 the result is another prime number (A005385)

%F A131101 a(n)+ prime factors of a(n) + 1 = p ; p is a prime number, member of A131102.
%e A131101 a(8)=29 because 29 + its only prime factor (itself) + 1 = 29+29+1= 59, and 59 is a prime number = A131102(8) = A005385(6).
%e A131101 a(9)=30 because 30 + its prime factors + 1 = 30 +(2+3+5)+1 =41, and 41 is a prime number = A131102(9).
