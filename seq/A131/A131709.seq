%N A131709 Number of partitions into "bus routes" of an n X 1 grid.
%C A131709 If we make bus routes on a graph G, the routes should satisfy the following conditions.
%C A131709 1. One and only one route exists on all edges of G
%C A131709 2. Terminals of two different routes don't meet on the same point
%C A131709 This definition is equivalent to a "partition of graph G into undirected strokes". It is defined as follows.
%C A131709 Given an undirected graph G=(V,E), its partition into strokes is a collection of directed edge-disjoint paths (viewed as sets of directed edges) on V such that (i) union of any two paths is not a path; (ii)union of corresponding undirected paths is E.
%C A131709 So the case of undirected paths is the following.
%C A131709 Definition. Given an undirected graph G=(V,E), its partition into strokes is a collection of edge-disjoint paths (viewed as sets of edges) on V such that (i) union of any two paths is not a path; (ii) union of paths is E.
