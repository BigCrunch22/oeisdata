%N A131212 D_6 like six sided prism as a substitution on a graph: characteristic polynomial is: 144 x^4 - 232 x^6 + 105 x^8 - 18 x^10 + x^12.
%C A131212 Each vertex has three connections in analogy to three tone musical chords and there are twelve vertices in analogy to a 12 tone scale. The sequence that results seems to be limited by the starting configuration: no "12" shows up in the first 5 substitutions.
%F A131212 Substitution of the form for 3 for 12 types: a(m)={a(n),a(o),a(p)}
%e A131212 If "1" is the Note "A", then the chord substitution is A->B, Eflat,E
