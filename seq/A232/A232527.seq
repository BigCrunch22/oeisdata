%N A232527 Numbers n such that there are no positive integers m such that m^3 is of the form x^2 + n*y^2 and m is not of the form x^2 + n*y^2.
%C A232527 Equivalently, numbers n such that there are no positive integers m such that m^r is of the form x^2 + n*y^2 and m is not of the form x^2 + n*y^2, for any odd integer r >= 3.
%C A232527 Because if m is not of the form x^2 + n*y^2 and m^(r-2) is not of the form x^2 + n*y^2, but m^r = a^2 + n*b^2, then m^(r+2) = (m*a)^2+n*(m*b)^2, m^(r+4) = (m^2*a)^2+n*(m^2*b)^2, etc. are also of the form x^2 + n*y^2. Then m^(3*r-6) = (m^(r-2))^3 = (m^(r-3)*a)^2 + n*(m^(r-3)*b)^2 is of the form x^2 + n*y^2 and m^(r-2) is not of the form x^2 + n*y^2.
%C A232527 All squarefree convenient numbers (A000926) congruent to {1, 2, 3, 5, 6} mod 8 are members of this sequence.
%C A232527 It appears that for a given value of n, if there is an m such that m^3 is of the form x^2 + n*y^2 and m is not of the form x^2 + n*y^2, then there exists some m < n that satisfies this condition.
%C A232527 Is this sequence finite?
%C A232527 Is 66045 the largest term of this sequence?

%e A232527 n = 11 is not a member of this sequence because for m = 23, 23 is not of form x^2 + 11*y^2, but 23^3 = 12167 = 54^2 + 11*29^2.
