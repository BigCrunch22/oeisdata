%N A232895 Sequence (or tree) S of all positive integers in the order generated by these rules:  1 and 2 are in S; if x is in S then x + 2 and 2*x are in S, where duplicates are deleted as they occur.
%C A232895 Let S be the sequence (or tree) of numbers generated by these rules:  1 and 2 are in S; if x is in S then x + 2 and 2*x are in S, where duplicates are deleted as they occur. Every positive integer occurs exactly once in S, so that S is a permutation of the natural numbers.  Deleting duplicates as they occur, the generations of S are given by g(1) = (1,2), g(2) = (3,4), g(3) = (5,6,8), g(4) = (7,10,12,16), ... Concatenating gives 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,...  Conjecture: the position of the n-th odd positive integer in S is the linearly recurrent sequence given by A232896(n) for n>=1.

%e A232895 To generate S, start with g(1) = (1,2).  Then 1 begets 3 and 2, but 2 is deleted as a duplicate, and 2 begets 4 and 4, of which the second 4 is deleted; thus g(2) = (3,4).
