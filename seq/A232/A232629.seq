%N A232629 Coefficients of the algebraic number 2*sin(4*Pi/n) in the power basis of Q(2*cos(Pi/q(2,n))), with q(2,n) = A232625(n), n >= 1.
%C A232629 The length of row n is A232626(n).
%C A232629 In a regular n-gon, n>=2, inscribed in a circle of radius R (in some length units), 2*sin(4*Pi/n) = (S(n)/R)*(D(1,n)/S(n)) = D(1,n)/R, with the side length S(n) and the length of the first (smallest) diagonal D(1,n). For n=2 there is no such diagonal, and one can put D(1,2) = 0. Obviously, D(1,2*m) = S(m), m >= 2.
%C A232629 See a comment on A231190 regarding the pair of sequences  p(k,n) and q(k,n), n >= 1, k >= 1. Here k=2 with A231190 and A232625.
%C A232629 See also the k=1 analog A231189 of the present table.
%C A232629 The relevant identity is here 2*sin(Pi*4/n) = 2*cos(Pi*abs(n-8)/(2*n)) = 2*cos(Pi*p(2,n)/q(2,n)). This is R(p(2,n), x) (mod C(q(2,n), x)), with x = 2*cos(Pi/q(2,n)) =: rho(q(2,n)). with the coefficient tables for the polynomials R and C given in A127672 and A187360, respectively. This gives the power base coefficients of 2*sin(Pi*4/n) in the algebraic number field Q(rho(q(2,n))) of degree delta(q(2,n)), with delta(n) = A055034(n), shown in A232626.
%C A232629 If the degree p(2,n) of R(p(2,n), x) is smaller than the degree A232626(n) of C(q(2,n), x) then 2*sin(Pi*4/n) = R(p(2,n), x). Otherwise the (mod C(q(2,n), x)) congruence is needed. This happens for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 21, 24, 27, 30,...
%C A232629 The power basis of Q(rho(q(2,n))) is <1, rho(q(2,n)), ..., rho(q(2,n))^(delta(q(2,n))-1)>. Therefore the length of row n of this table is delta(q(2,n)) = A232626(n).
%C A232629 The coefficient table for the minimal polynomial of 2*sin(Pi*4/n) is given in A232630.
%F A232629 a(n,m) = [x^m] (R(p(2,n), x) (mod C(q(2,n), x)), n >= 1, m = 0, 1, ..., A232626(n) - 1, where the C and R polynomials are found in A187360 and A127672, respectively. p(2,n) = A231190(n) and q(2,n) = A232625(n). Powers of x = rho(q(2,n)) := 2*cos(Pi/q(2,n)) appear in the table in increasing order.
%F A232629 a(2*l,m) = A231189(l,m), l >= 1, m = 0, 1, ..., (A093819(n)-1).
%e A232629 The table a(n,m) begins (the trailing zeros are needed to have the correct degree A232626(n) in Q(rho(q(2,n))))

%e A232629 n=1: 2*sin(Pi*4/1) = 0. R(p(2,1), x) = R(7, x) = -7*x + 14*x^3 -7*x^5 + x^7. C(q(2,1), x) = C(2, x) = x, hence R(7, x) (mod C(2, x)) == 0, and

%e A232629 n=8: this row with entry 2 coincides with row n=4 of A231189.
%e A232629 n=17: row length A232626(17) = 16; p(2,17) = 9; C(34, x) has degree 16, therefore the R(9, x) coefficients produce here the first 10 entries for row n=17: 0  9  0 -30  0  27  0 -9  0  1, followed by 6 zeros, and 2*sin(Pi*4/17) = 9*rho(34) - 30*rho(34)^3 + 27*rho(34)^5 - 9*rho(34)^7 + 1*rho(34)^9, with rho(34) = 2*cos(Pi/34).
