%N A232798 Sequence (or tree) generated by these rules: 1 is in S, and if x is in S, then x + 1, 3*x - 1 and 3*x + 1 are in S, and duplicates are deleted as they occur.
%C A232798 Let S be the sequence (or tree) of numbers defined by these rules:  1 is in S, and if x is in S, then x + 1, 3*x - 1, and 3*x + 1 are in S.  Then S is a permutation of the positive integers.  Deleting duplicates as they occur, the generations of S are given by g(1) = (1), g(2) = (2,4), g(3) = (3,5,7,11,13), etc.  Concatenating these gives A232798.  The position of n in S gives the inverse permutation of S, as in A232799.

%e A232798 Each x begets x + 1, 3*x - 1 and 3*x + 1, but if any of these has already occurred it is deleted.  Thus, 1 begets (2,4); then 2 begets (3,5,7) and 4 begets (11,13), making g(3) = (3,5,7,11,13), etc.
