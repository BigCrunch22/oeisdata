%N A232005 Number of distinct resistances that can be produced from a circuit of resistors with resistances 1, 2, ..., n using only series and parallel combinations.
%C A232005 Found by exhaustive search: all configurations of resistors were enumerated, resistances calculated, sorted, and distinct values counted.
%C A232005 This sequence allows any circuits to be combined in series or in parallel (akin A000084); A051045 requires circuits to be combined with a single resistor at a time.
%C A232005 This sequence regards circuits as distinct only if their resistance is different; A006351 regards circuits distinct if their configuration is different, although some may have the same resistance.
%C A232005 This sequence considers resistors with contiguous resistances 1, 2, ..., n; A005840 considers arbitrarily different resistors, while A048211 considers n equal resistances.
%e A232005 a(2) = 2 since given a 1-ohm and a 2-ohm resistor, a series circuit yields 3 ohms, while a parallel circuit yields 2/3 ohms, which thus yields two distinct resistances.
%Y A232005 Cf. A005840, A006352, A048211, A051045.
