%N A232499 Number of unit squares, aligned with a Cartesian grid, completely within the first quadrant of a circle centered at the origin ordered by increasing radius.
%C A232499 The interval between terms reflects the number of ways a square integer can be partitioned into the sum of two square integers in an ordered pair. As examples, the increase from a(1) to a(2) from 1 to 3 is due to the inclusion of (1,2) and (2,1); and the increase from a(2) to a(3) is due to the inclusion of (2,2). Larger intervals occur when there are more combinations, such as, between a(17) and a(18) when (1,7), (7,1), and (5,5) are included.

%e A232499 When radius of the circle exceeds 2^(1/2), one square is completely within the circle until the radius reaches 5^(1/2) when three squares are completely within the circle.

%Y A232499 First differences are in A229904.
%Y A232499 The first differences must be odd at positions given in A024517 by proof by symmetry as r^2=2*n^2 is on the x=y line.
%Y A232499 The radii corresponding to the terms are given by the square roots of A000404.
