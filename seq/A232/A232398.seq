%N A232398 Number of ways to write n = p + (2^k - k) + (2^m - m) with p prime and 0 < k <= m.
%C A232398 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 3.
%C A232398 This was motivated by A231201. We have verified the conjecture for n up to 2*10^8. It seems that a(n) = 1 for no odd n.
%C A232398 In contrast, R. Crocker proved that there are infinitely many positive odd numbers not of the form p + 2^k + 2^m with p prime and k, m > 0.
%C A232398 It seems that any integer n > 3 not equal to 1361802 can be written in the form p + (2^k + k) + (2^m + m), where p is a prime, and k and m are nonnegative integers.
%C A232398 On Dec 08 2013, Qing-Hu Hou finished checking the conjecture for n up to 10^10 and found no counterexamples. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Dec 08 2013

%e A232398 a(11) = 2 since 11 = 5 + (2 - 1) + (2^3 - 3) = 7 + (2^2 - 2) + (2^2 - 2) with 5 and 7 prime.
