%N A232723 Sequence (or tree) generated by these rules: 0 is in S, and if x is in S, then 2*x and 1 - x are in S, and duplicates are deleted as they occur.
%C A232723 Let S be the set of numbers defined by these rules: 0 is in S, and if x is in S, then 2*x and 1 - x  are in S.  Then S is the set of integers, which arise in generations.  Deleting duplicates as they occur, the generations are given by g(1) = (0), g(2) = (1), g(3) = (2), g(4) = (4,-1), g(5) = (8,-3,-2), etc.  Concatenating these gives A232723.  Every integer occurs exactly once in S.  The even integers occupy the positions given by the lower Wythoff sequence, A000201; the odds, by the upper Wythoff sequence, A001950. The positive integers occupy the positions given by A189035, and the positions of the nonpositives, by A189034.

%e A232723 Each x begets 2*x and 1 - x, and if either has already occurred it is deleted. Thus, 0 begets 1, which begets 2, which begets (4,-1), etc.
