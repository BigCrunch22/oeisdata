%N A232563 Sequence (or tree) generated by these rules: 1 is in S, and if x is in S, then x + 1 and 4*x are in S, and duplicates are deleted as they occur.
%C A232563 Let S be the set of numbers defined by these rules:  1 is in S, and if x is in S, then x + 1 and 4*x are in S.  Then S is the set of all positive integers, which arise in generations.  Deleting duplicates as they occur, the generations are given by g(1) = (1), g(2) = (2,4), g(3) = (3,8,5,16), g(4) = (12,9,32,6,20,17,64), etc.  Concatenating these gives A232563, a permutation of the positive integers.  The number of numbers in g(n) is A001631(n), the n-th tetranacci number.  It is helpful to show the results as a tree with the terms of S as nodes and edges from x to x + 1 if x + 1 has not already occurred, and an edge from x to 4*x if 4*x has not already occurred.

%e A232563 Each x begets x + 1 and 4*x, but if either has already occurred it is deleted.  Thus, 1 begets 2 and 4; in the next generation, 2 begets 3 and 8, and 4 begets 5 and 16.
