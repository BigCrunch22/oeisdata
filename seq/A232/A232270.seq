%N A232270 Number of ways to write n = x + y (0 < x <= y) with sigma(x) + phi(y) prime, where sigma(x) is the sum of all (positive) divisors of x and phi is Euler's totient function.
%C A232270 Conjecture:  (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 1, and a(n) = 1 only for n = 2, 3, 4, 29, 70, 105.
%C A232270 (ii) Any integer n > 164 can be written as x + y (x, y > 0) with sigma(x) + sigma(y) prime.

%e A232270 a(2) = 1 since 2 = 1 + 1 with sigma(1) + phi(1) = 2 prime.
%e A232270 a(29) = 1 since 29 = 1 + 28 with sigma(1) + phi(28) = 13 prime.
%e A232270 a(70) = 1 since 70 = 9 + 61 with sigma(9) + phi(61) = 73 prime.
%e A232270 a(105) = 1 since 105 = 4 + 101 with sigma(4) + phi(101) = 107 prime.
