%N A232637 Odious numbers of order 2: a(n) = A000069(A000069(n)).
%C A232637 Odious numbers with odious subscripts.
%C A232637 From _Antti Karttunen_, Nov 29 2013: (Start)
%C A232637 Starting from 4 and iterating A000069(4), A000069(A000069(4)), A000069(A000069(A000069(4))), etc. gives A004119 from its second term onward: 4, 7, 13, 25, 49, 97, 193, ..., which is thus a subsequence of this sequence from the term 7 onward.
%C A232637 Proof: All of the terms A004119(n) are odious although A004119(n)-1 is evil, and the formula for A000069(n) reduces to a(n) = 2n - 1 when n-1 is evil, and iterating that formula starting from 4 gives A004119 from 7 onward (cf. _Philippe DelÃ©ham_'s formula there dated Feb 20 2004).
%C A232637 (End)
%C A232637 These numbers are never multiples of 4. Probably there are infinitely many multiples of m in this sequence for any m not divisible by 4. Equivalently, A233419(n) > 0 for all n. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Dec 05 2013

%e A232637 The first odious number, A000069(1) = 1, and A000069(1) = 1, so a(1) = 1.
%e A232637 The second odious number, A000069(2) = 2, and A000069(2) = 2, so a(2) = 2.
%e A232637 Those were the only fixed points of A000069, and after that, we have:
%e A232637 The third odious number, A000069(3) = 4, and A000069(4) = 7, thus a(3) = 7.
%e A232637 The fourth odious number, A000069(4) = 7, and A000069(7) = 13, thus a(4) = 13.
