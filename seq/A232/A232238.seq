%N A232238 Primes p such that p+2 and q are primes, where q is concatenation of binary representations of p and p+2: q = p * 2^L + p+2, where L is the length of binary representation of p+2: L=A070939(p+2).
%F A232238 A232236(n) = a(n) * 2^A070939(a(n)+2) + a(n)+2.
%e A232238 3 is 11 in binary, 5 is 101. Because 11101 = 29d is a prime, 3 is in the sequence.
%e A232238 5 is 101 in binary, 7 is 111, and because 101111 = 47d is a prime, 5 is in the sequence.
