%N A232890 Denominator of n-th term of sequence (or tree) S of all rational numbers generated by these rules:  0 is in S; if x is in S then x + 1 is in S, and if x + 1 is nonzero, then -1/(x + 1) is in S; duplicates are deleted as they occur.
%C A232890 Let S be the sequence (or tree) of numbers generated by these rules:  0 is in S; if x is in S then x + 1 is in S, and if x + 1 is nonzero, then -1/(x + 1) is in S.  Deleting duplicates as they occur, the generations of S are given by g(1) = (0), g(2) = (1,-1), g(3) = (2,-1/2), g(4) = (3, -1/3, 1/2, -2), ... Concatenating gives 0, 1, -1, 2, -1/2, 3, -1/3, 1/2, -2, 4, -1/4, ...
%C A232890 Conjectures:  If b/c is a positive rational number, the position of n + b/c for n >= 0 forms a linear recurrence sequence with signature (1,1), and the position of -n - b/c forms a linear recurrence sequence with signature (4, -4, 1).  For n>=1, the numbers -(1 + 1/n) are terminal nodes in the tree, and their positions are linearly recurrent with signature (2,0,-1).  For n >=3, the n-th generation g(n) consists of F(n-1) positive numbers and F(n-1) negative numbers, where F = A000045, the Fibonacci numbers.

%e A232890 To generate S, the number 0 begets (1,-1), whence 1 begets 2 and -1/2, whereas -1 begets 0 and -1/2, both of which are (deleted )duplicates, so that g(3) = (2, -1/2).  The resulting concatenation of all the generations g(n) begins with 0, 1, -1, 2, -1/2, 3, -1/3, 1/2, -2, 4, -1/4, so that A232890 begins with 1,1,1,1,2,1,3,2,1,1,4.
