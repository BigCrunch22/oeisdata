%N A232561 Sequence (or tree) generated by these rules: 1 is in S, and if x is in S, then x + 1 and 3*x are in S, and duplicates are deleted as they occur.
%C A232561 Let S be the set of numbers defined by these rules:  1 is in S, and if x is in S, then x + 1 and 3*x are in S.  Then S is the set of all positive integers, which arise in generations.  Deleting duplicates as they occur, the generations are given by g(1) = (1), g(2) = (2,3), g(3) = (6,4,9), g(4) = (7,18,5,8,10,27), etc.  Concatenating these gives A232561, a permutation of the positive integers.  The number of numbers in g(n) is A001590(n), the n-th tribonacci number.  It is helpful to show the results as a tree with the terms of S as nodes and edges from x to x + 1 if x + 1 has not already occurred, and an edge from x to 3*x if 3*x has not already occurred.

%e A232561 Each x begets x + 1 and 3*x, but if either has already occurred it is deleted.  Thus, 1 begets 2 and 3; in the next generation, 2 begets only 6, and 3 begets 4 and 9.
