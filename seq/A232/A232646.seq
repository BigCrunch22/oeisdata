%N A232646 Sequence (or tree or triangle) generated by these rules: 1 is in S, and if x is in S, then 2*x and 5*x + 3 are in S, and duplicates are deleted as they occur.
%C A232646 Let S be the set of numbers defined by these rules:  1 is in S, and if x is in S, then 2*x and 5*x  are in S.  Then S is the set of positive integers, which arise in generations.  Deleting duplicates as they occur, the generations are given by g(1) = (1), g(2) = (2,5), g(3) = (4,10,25), etc.  Concatenating these gives A232646, a permutation of the positive integers.  For n > 2, the number of numbers in g(n) is n.  It is helpful to show the results as a tree with the terms of S as nodes, an edge from x to 2*x if  2*x has not already occurred, and an edge from x to 3*x if 3*x  has not already occurred.

%F A232646 Counting the top row as row 0 and writing <i,j> for (2^i)*(5*j) , the numbers in row n are <n,0>, <n-1,1>, ..., <0,n>.
%e A232646 Each x begets 2*x and 5*x, but if either has already occurred it is deleted.  Thus, 1 begets 2 and 5; then 2 begets 4 and 10, and 5 begets only 25, so that g(3) = (4,10,25).  Writing generations as rows results in a triangle whose first five rows are as follows:
%e A232646 1
%e A232646 2 .... 5
%e A232646 4 .... 10 ... 25
%e A232646 8 .... 20 ... 50 ... 125
