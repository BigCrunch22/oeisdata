%N A232084 Least k such that prime(n) + 2^(k+L) - 2^L is a prime, where L is the length of binary representation of prime(n): L = A070939(A000040(n)). a(n) = -1 if no such k exists.
%C A232084 Least number of 1's that must be prepended to the binary representation of prime(n) such that the result is another prime.
%C A232084 Prime(n) is in A065047 if and only if a(n) = 1.
%e A232084 a(6) = 1 because 13 in binary is 1101, and 29 (11101 in binary) is a prime.
%e A232084 a(7) = 2 because 17 in binary is 10001, and 113 (1110001 in binary) is a prime.
%e A232084 a(8) = 4 because 19 in binary is 10011, and 499 (111110011 in binary) is a prime.
%Y A232084 Cf. A000040, A070939, A065047, A094076, A023758.
