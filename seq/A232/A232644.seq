%N A232644 Sequence (or tree) generated by these rules: 1 is in S, and if x is in S, then x + 1 and 2*x + 3 are in S, and duplicates are deleted as they occur.
%C A232644 Let S be the set of numbers defined by these rules: 1 is in S, and if x is in S, then x + 1 and 2*x + 3 are in S. Then S is the set of positive integers, which arise in generations. Deleting duplicates as they occur, the generations are given by g(1) = (1), g(2) = (2,5), g(3) = (3,7,6,13), etc. Concatenating these gives A232644, a permutation of the positive integers. For n > 2, the number of numbers in g(n) is L(n), where F = A000032, the Lucas numbers. It is helpful to show the results as a tree with the terms of S as nodes, an edge from x to x + 1 if x + 1 has not already occurred, and an edge from x to 2*x + 3 if 2*x + 3 has not already occurred.

%e A232644 Each x begets x + 1 and 2*x + 3, but if either has already occurred it is deleted. Thus, 1 begets 2 and 5; then 2 begets 3 and 7, and 5 begets 6 and 13, so that g(3) = (3,7,6,13).
