%N A232640 Sequence (or tree) generated by these rules: 1 is in S, and if x is in S, then x + 1 and 2*x + 1 are in S, and duplicates are deleted as they occur.
%C A232640 Let S be the set of numbers defined by these rules: 1 is in S, and if x is in S, then x + 1 and 2*x + 1 are in S. Then S is the set of positive integers, which arise in generations. Deleting duplicates as they occur, the generations are given by g(1) = (1), g(2) = (2,3), g(3) = (5,4,7), etc. Concatenating these gives A232640, a permutation of the positive integers. The number of numbers in g(n) is F(n), where F = A000045, the Fibonacci numbers. It is helpful to show the results as a tree with the terms of S as nodes, an edge from x to x + 1 if x + 1 has not already occurred, and an edge from x to 2*x + 1 if 2*x + 1 has not already occurred.

%e A232640 Each x begets x + 1 and 2*x + 1, but if either has already occurred it is deleted. Thus, 1 begets 2 and 3; then 2 begets only 5, and 3 begets (4,7), so that g(3) = (5,4,7).
