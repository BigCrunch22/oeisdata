%N A232241 Composites where the greatest prime factor is the sum of the other prime powers.
%C A232241 This is the sequence of positive integers that can be expressed as the product of prime powers, multiplied by the sum of the same prime powers.  And the sum of the prime powers is also the greatest prime factor of the composite number.
%C A232241 I.e., there is a solution for n=(p1^i1*p2^i2*p3^i3...)*(p1^i1+p2^i2+pi3^i3...); where p1, p2, p3, etc. are distinct primes; and i1, i2, i3, etc. are the corresponding positive exponents.
%C A232241 The additional constraint is that the sum of the prime powers must also be the greatest prime factor (gpf) of n.
%C A232241 This sequence also contains the square of every prime number.

%e A232241 9 is in the sequence since prod(3^1)*sum(3^1)=(3^1)*(3^1)=3*3=9, and the gpf, 3 is prime.
%e A232241 1224 is in the sequence since (2^3*3^2)*(2^3+3^2)=(8*9)*(8+9)=72*17=1224, and the gpf, 17 is prime.
%e A232241 6032 is in the sequence since (2^4*13^1)*(2^4+13^1)=(16*13)*(16+13)=208*29=6032, and the gpf, 29 is prime.
