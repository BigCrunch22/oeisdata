%N A232802 Number of solution pairs (x,y) for x <= 11 such that x! + n = y^2 (Brocard-Ramanujan Diophantine equation) is soluble over the integers.
%C A232802 The Mathematica program will find the number of integer pairs (x,y) solving x!+n = y^2 for each n from 1 to 200 with x not exceeding 11. Dabrowski showed that the abc conjecture implies only finite solutions for each n. Berndt and Galway found that 11 was the highest value that x reached for a solution with n in the range 1 to 2500 and could find no further solution pairs (x,y) in that range even when x was increased to 10^5.
%C A232802 For n = 1 the number of solutions and arbitrary x is Brocard's problem, and it is conjectured - but verified only in the range x <= 10^12 - that there are 3 solution pairs (x,y): (4,5), (5,11), (7,71). - _Georg Fischer_, Nov 27 2020
