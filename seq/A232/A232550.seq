%N A232550 Number of distinct primitive quadratic forms of discriminant = -4n that exist such that every prime p for which p is a quadratic residue (mod 4n) or p-n is a quadratic residue (mod 4n) can be represented by one of them.
%C A232550 A quadratic form is primitive if the GCD of the coefficients is 1. For example, the quadratic form 2*x^2+4*y^2 is not primitive.
%C A232550 Two quadratic forms f(x,y) = a*x^2+b*x*y+c*y^2 and g(x,y) = p*x^2+q*x*y+r*y^2 are distinct (or inequivalent) if and only if one cannot be obtained by a linear transformation (of the variables x, y) from the other. For example, the three quadratic forms u(x,y) = 3*x^2+2*x*y+3*y^2, v(x,y) = 3*x^2+4*x*y+4*y^2 and w(x,y) = 3*x^2+10*x*y+11*y^2 are equivalent because v(x,y) = u(x+y,-y) and w(x,y) = v(x+y,y). Also, w(x,y) = u(x+2*y,-y). Similarly, the two quadratic forms s(x,y) = 8*x^2+9*y^2 and t(x,y) = 17*x^2+50*x*y+41*y^2 are equivalent because t(x,y) = s(x+2*y,x+y).
%C A232550 The quadratic form x^2+n*y^2 is one such form and the only such form if n is a convenient number (A000926).
%C A232550 a(n) = 1 if and only if n is a convenient number (A000926).
%C A232550 Any prime p such that p is a quadratic residue (mod 4n) or p-n is a quadratic residue (mod 4n) can be represented by exactly one of the a(n) distinct primitive quadratic forms of discriminant = -4n in at most four different ways (if n >= 2) or in at most eight different ways (if n = 1).
%C A232550 If a prime p can be written in the form x^2+n*y^2, then either p is a quadratic residue (mod 4n) or p-n is a quadratic residue (mod 4n), assuming that p^2 does not divide n.
%C A232550 For primes p such that p is a quadratic residue (mod 4n) or p-n is a quadratic residue (mod 4n), there is a lowest square m^2 such that m^2*p can be written in form x^2+n*y^2, where x and y are nonnegative integers (see A232529 and A232530).
%C A232550 If n is a prime congruent to 3 (mod 4), then a(n) = A232551(n).
%C A232550 The product of two numbers (prime or composite, same or different) which can be represented by the same quadratic form of discriminant = -4n can be written in the form x^2+n*y^2, as the following identity shows.
%C A232550 (X*a^2+Y*a*b+Z*b^2)*(X*c^2+Y*c*d+Z*d^2) = (a*c*X+b*d*Z+a*d*(Y/2)+b*c*(Y/2))^2 + ((X*Z)-(Y^2/4))*(a*d-b*c)^2.
%C A232550 (X*a^2+Y*a*b+Z*b^2)*(X*c^2+Y*c*d+Z*d^2) = (a*c*X+b*d*((Y^2/(2*X))-Z)+a*d*(Y/2)+b*c*(Y/2))^2 + ((X*Z)-(Y^2/4))*(b*d*(Y/X)+a*d+b*c)^2.
%C A232550 Note that for the latter equation, (a*c*X+b*d*((Y^2/(2*X))-Z)+a*d*(Y/2)+b*c*(Y/2)) and (b*d*(Y/X)+a*d+b*c) need not always be integers. If they are both integers, then it will be a second representation of the product of (X*a^2+Y*a*b+Z*b^2) and (X*c^2+Y*c*d+Z*d^2) in the form x^2+((X*Z)-(Y^2/4))*y^2.
