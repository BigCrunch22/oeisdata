%e A232750 The two sequences begin as:
%e A232750 A232739:  2,  4,6,  9,  13,17,   22,   28,34,  41,  49,   58,67,   77,   ...

%e A232750 We let a(0)=1 stand for the number of terms of A005228 that are before the first term of A232739, namely that 1 which is less than 2, and thereafter we count the terms of A005228 that occur between each two consecutive terms of A232739, noting that 3 in the latter occurs between 2 and 4 in the former, thus a(1)=1, no terms in the latter occur between 4 and 6 in the former, thus a(2)=0, 7 in the latter occurs between 6 and 9 in the former, thus a(3)=1, and so on. See also the example in A232740.
