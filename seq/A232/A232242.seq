%N A232242 A walk based on the digits of E = exp(1) (A001113).
%C A232242 E = 2.718281828459045...
%C A232242 Between 2 and 7 we place 3, 4, 5 and 6.
%C A232242 Between 7 and 1 we place 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2.
%C A232242 Between 1 and 8 we place 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.
%C A232242 Between 8 and 2 we place 7, 6, 5, 4 and 3, and so on.
%C A232242 This gives:
