%N A357961 a(1) = 1, and for any n > 0, a(n+1) is the k-th positive number not yet in the sequence, where k is the Hamming weight of a(n).
%C A357961 This sequence is a permutation of the positive integers:
%C A357961 - Let e = A000523 and w = A000120.
%C A357961 - Lemma: a(n) <= n + e(n)
%C A357961     - This property is true for n = 1.
%C A357961     - Assume that a(n) <= n + e(n) for some n >= 1.
%C A357961     - Then a(n+1) <= n + w(a(n))
%C A357961                   <= n + e(a(n))
%C A357961                   <= n + e(n + e(n))
%C A357961                   <= n + e(2*n)
%C A357961                   <= n + 1 + e(n)
%C A357961                   <= n + 1 + e(n + 1) - QED.
%C A357961 - If this sequence is not a permutation, then some number is missing.
%C A357961 - Let v be the least number that does not appear in the sequence.
%C A357961 - At some point, v is the least number not yet in the sequence.
%C A357961 - From now on, powers of 2 can no longer appear in the sequence.
%C A357961 - So there are infinitely many numbers that do not appear in the sequence.
%C A357961 - Let w be the least number > v that does not appear in the sequence.
%C A357961 - At some point, v and w are the two least numbers not yet in the sequence.
%C A357961 - Say this happens after m terms and max(a(1), ..., a(m)) < 2^k (with k > 0).
%C A357961 - From now on, powers of 2 and sums of two powers of 2 can no longer appear.
%C A357961 - So the numbers 2^k, 2^k + 2^i where i = 0..k-1 won't appear,
%C A357961   and the numbers 2^(k+1), 2^(k+1) + 2^i where i = 0..k won't appear.
%C A357961 - So among the first 2^(k+2) terms, by the pigeonhole principle,
%C A357961   we necessarily have a term a(n) >= 2^(k+2) + 2*k + 3.
%C A357961 - But we also know that a(n) <= 2^(k+2) + e(2^(k+2)) = 2^(k+2) + k + 2.
%C A357961 - This is a contradiction - QED.
%C A357961 Conjecture: this permutation has only finite cycles because it appears that for each interval a(1..2^m) the maximal observed displacement is smaller than 2^m and this maximal displacement is realized by only one element in this interval for m > 3. - _Thomas Scheuerle_, Oct 22 2022
