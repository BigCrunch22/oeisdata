%N A357714 a(n) is the number of equations in the set E_{n,b} := {x+2^b*y=n^b, 2^b*x+3^b*y=n^b, ..., k^b*x+(k+1)^b*y=n^b, ..., n^b*x+(n+1)^b*y=n^b} which admit at least one nonnegative integer solution when b is sufficiently large.
%C A357714 Defining a(n,b) as the number of equations of the set E_{n,b} which admit at least one nonnegative integer solution, it's possible to prove the existence of b_0 such that for all b > b_0, a(n,b) = a(n) whose value does not depend on b anymore.
%C A357714 a(n) is the number of positive integers k such that k(k+1) <= n or k divides n or k+1 divides n.
%F A357714 a(n) = ceiling(sqrt(n) - 3/2) + A000005(n).
%F A357714 a(n) ~ A356770(n)/2 as n->infinity.
%F A357714 a(n) <= A356770(n) for all n >= 1.
%e A357714 a(11) = 4 since for all b >= 29 the number of equations of the set E_{11,b} which admit at least one nonnegative integer solution is exactly equal to 4.
%e A357714 a(4) = 4 since for all b >= 1 the number of equations of the set E_{11,b} which admit at least one nonnegative integer solution is exactly equal to 4.
