%N A357275 Smallest side of integer-sided primitive triangles whose angles satisfy A < B < C = 2*Pi/3.
%C A357275 The triples of sides (a,b,c) with a < b < c are in nondecreasing order of largest side c, and if largest sides coincide, then by increasing order of the smallest side. This sequence lists the a's.
%C A357275 For the corresponding primitive triples and miscellaneous properties and references, see A357274.
%C A357275 Solutions a of the Diophantine equation c^2 = a^2 + a*b + b^2 with gcd(a,b) = 1 and a < b.
%C A357275 Also, a is generated by integers u, v such that gcd(u,v) = 1 and 0 < v < u, with a = u^2 - v^2.
%C A357275 This sequence is not increasing. For example, a(2) = 7 for triangle with largest side = 13 while a(3) = 5 for triangle with largest side = 19.
%C A357275 Differs from A088514, the first 20 terms are the same then a(21) = 56 while A088514(21) = 25.
%C A357275 A229858 gives all the possible values of the smallest side a, in increasing order without repetition, but for all triples, not necessarily primitive.
%C A357275 All terms of A106505 are values taken by the smallest side a, in increasing order without repetition for primitive triples, but not all the lengths of this side a are present; example: 3 is not in A106505 (see comment in A229849).
%F A357275 a(n) = A357274(n, 1).
%e A357275 a(2) = a(5) = 7 because 2nd and 5th triple are respectively (7, 8, 13) and (7, 33, 37).
