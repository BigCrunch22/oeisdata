%F A357808 a(n) = A001358(A106129(n)).
%e A357808 The 1st semiprime is 4, which is congruent to 4 (modulo 1), so 4 is in the sequence.
%e A357808 The 2nd semiprime is 6, which is congruent to 4 (modulo 2), so 6 is in the sequence.
%e A357808 The 3rd semiprime is 9, which is not congruent to 4 (modulo 3), so 9 is not in the sequence.
%e A357808 The 4th semiprime is 10, which is not congruent to 4 (modulo 4), so 10 is not in the sequence.
%e A357808 The 5th semiprime is 14, which is congruent to 4 (modulo 5), so 14 is in the sequence.
