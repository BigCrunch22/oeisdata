%N A357040 Deficient composite numbers whose sum of aliquot divisors as well as product of aliquot divisors is a perfect square.
%C A357040 Deficient number in A064116; that is, the intersection of A064116 and A005100.
%C A357040 Prime numbers are excluded from this sequence as they make a trivial case: they have the sum as well as the product of aliquot divisor equal to 1.
%e A357040 Aliquot divisors of 75 are 1, 3, 5, 15, and 25. The sum is 49 = 7^2, and the product is 5625 = 75^2. Thus, 75 is in this sequence.
