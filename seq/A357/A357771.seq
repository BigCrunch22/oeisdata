%N A357771 Number of 2n-step closed paths on quasi-regular rhombic (rhombille) lattice starting from a degree-6 node.
%C A357771 Paths that return to the same point in a quasi-regular rhombic lattice must always have even length (i.e., 2n) because of parity: degree-6 nodes alternate with degree-3 nodes.
%e A357771 a(2)=60, because there are 6*6=36 paths that visit one of six adjacent vertices, return to the origin, and again visit an adjacent vertex and return to the origin; plus 6*4=24 paths that pass through one of the six vertices at distance 2, leaving and returning via any of two available paths to that vertex; all resulting in a closed path of length 2n=2*2=4.
%Y A357771 The accompanying sequences for the number of paths that return to a degree-3 node is A357770.
%Y A357771 Similar sequences for square, hexagonal, and honeycomb lattices are A002894, A002898 and A002893.
