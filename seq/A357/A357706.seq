%N A357706 Numbers k such that the k-th composition in standard order has half-alternating sum and skew-alternating sum both 0.
%C A357706 We define the half-alternating sum of a sequence (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, ...) to be A + B - C - D + E + F - G - ..., and the skew-alternating sum to be A - B - C + D + E - F - G + ...
%C A357706 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%F A357706 Intersection of A357625 and A357627.
