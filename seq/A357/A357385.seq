%C A357385 Conjectures:
%C A357385 1) The only distinct terms of this sequence are -1, 0 and 1.
%C A357385 2) The asymptotic density of the occurrences of 0 is 0.943..., and the asymptotic densities of the occurrences of -1 and 1 are equal and the common value is 0.028... .
%C A357385 These conjectures are empirically supported by the following numbers of occurrences of the terms -1, 0 and 1 up to n = 10^k:
