%N A357046 Squares visited by a knight moving on a board covered with horizontal dominoes [m|m], m = 0, 1, 2, ... in a diamond-shaped spiral, when the knight always jumps to the unvisited square with the least number on the corresponding domino.
%C A357046 The sequence lists the squares visited by the knight by giving their (unique) "square spiral number", as shown, e.g., in A316328 and others. (Listing the labels m of the dominoes would obviously be ambiguous; see EXAMPLE for that sequence.)
%C A357046 The dominoes [m|m], m = 0, 1, 2, ... are placed in a diamond-shaped spiral,

%C A357046 The spiral starts from the origin (where the [0|0] is placed) with one step in direction North-East (where [1|1] is placed), then one in direction North-West (=> [2|2]), then two towards South-West (=> [3|3] and [4|4]) and two towards South-East (=> [5|5] and [6|6]), then three towards North-East, etc. [We chose the counter-clockwise spiral as usual in mathematics, but one would obviously get the same sequence if the spiral of dominoes and the square spiral numbering the positions were chosen in the opposite, clockwise sense.]
%C A357046 The endpoints of the "straight lines" are labeled with the "quarter-squares" A002620, in particular, rightmost and leftmost dominoes of each "shell" are labeled with the odd resp. even square numbers.
%C A357046 The sequence ends at a(2550) where the knight is stuck at position (x, y) = (28, 4) on the domino labeled m = 964.

%e A357046 The knight hops from the left 0 (= the origin) on the right 1, then on the left 2, then on the right 0, then on the left 3, then on the right 2, etc.
%e A357046 The list of these labels would be 0, 1, 2, 0, 3, 2, 8, 3, 4, 5, 1, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 11, 10, 24, 22, 7, 8, 10, 9, 23, 6, 5, 15, 13, 12, 27, 26, 48, 23, ...
%e A357046 As explained in comments, the terms a(n) correspond to the (unique) "square spiral numbers" of these locations (cf. A274641 or A174344 (upside down) or A316328).
