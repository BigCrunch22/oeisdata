%N A357989 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct numbers such that every sum of consecutive terms is an evil number (A001969).
%C A357989 This sequence has similarities with A357579; here we avoid odious numbers, there we avoid perfect powers.
%C A357989 This sequence is well defined as we can always extend the sequence with an evil number whose binary expansion has no 1's in common with all sums of consecutive terms so far.
