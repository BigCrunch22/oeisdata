%F A357807 a(n) = A001358(A106128(n)).
%e A357807 The 1st semiprime is 4, which is congruent to 3 (mod 1), so 4 is in the sequence.
%e A357807 The 2nd semiprime is 6, which is not congruent to 3 (mod 2), so 6 is not in the sequence.
%e A357807 The 3rd semiprime is 9, which is congruent to 3 (mod 3), so 9 is in the sequence.
%e A357807 The 4th semiprime is 10, which is not congruent to 3 (mod 4), so 10 is not in the sequence.
