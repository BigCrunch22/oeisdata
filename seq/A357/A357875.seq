%N A357875 Numbers whose run-sums of prime indices are weakly increasing.
%C A357875 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798.
%C A357875 The sequence of runs of a sequence consists of its maximal consecutive constant subsequences when read left-to-right. For example, the runs of (2,2,1,1,1,3,2,2) are (2,2), (1,1,1), (3), (2,2), with sums (4,3,3,4).
