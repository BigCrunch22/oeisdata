%N A357877 The a(n)-th composition in standard order is the sequence of run-sums of the prime indices of n.
%C A357877 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798.
%C A357877 The sequence of runs of a sequence consists of its maximal consecutive constant subsequences when read left-to-right. For example, the runs of (2,2,1,1,1,3,2,2) are (2,2), (1,1,1), (3), (2,2), with sums (4,3,3,4).
%C A357877 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.

%e A357877 The prime indices of 24 are (1,1,1,2), with run-sums (3,2), and this is the 18th composition in standard order, so a(24) = 18.
