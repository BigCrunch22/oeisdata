%N A357991 Lexicographically earliest counterclockwise square spiral constructed using the nonnegative integers so that a(n) plus all other numbers currently visible from the current number form a distinct sum; start with a(0) = 0.
%C A357991 A number is visible from the current number if, given that it has coordinates (x,y) relative to the current number, the greatest common divisor of |x| and |y| is 1.
%C A357991 In the first 50000 terms the smallest number that has not appeared is 9; it is unknown if all the positive numbers eventually appear.
%e A357991 The spiral begins:

%e A357991 a(6) = 3 as from square 6, at (-1,-1) relative to the starting square, the numbers currently visible are 1 (at -1,0), 0 (at 0,0), 1 (at 1,0), and 1 (at 0,1). These three numbers sum to 3, so a(6) = 3 so that 3 + 3 = 6, the smallest sum that has not previous occurred.
%e A357991 a(8) = 4 as from square 8, at (1,-1) relative to the starting square, the numbers currently visible are 0 (at 0,-1), 1 (at -1,0), 0 (at 0,0), 1 (at 1,0), and 1 (at 0,1). These five numbers sum to 3, so a(8) = 4 so that 3 + 4 = 7, the smallest sum that has not previous occurred. Note that a(7) = 0 and forms a sum of 8.
