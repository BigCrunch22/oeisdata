%N A357943 a(0) = 0; a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the number of times the term a(n - 1 - a(n-1)) has appeared in the sequence.
%C A357943 In the first 100 million terms the longest run of consecutive equal terms is eight : a(69)..a(76) = 12. There is no other run of equal length in this range, and it is unknown if a longer run exists.
%C A357943 Other than the initial three terms, the first time a term exists that is one more than the previous term is a(29) = 8, a(30) = 9. Remarkably the first time two such consecutive terms exists is not until a(60917874) = 5394, a(60917875) = 5395, a(60917876) = 5396. It is unknown if three or more such terms exist.
%C A357943 Note that if the sequence starts with just a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1 then the resulting sequence is A003056.
%C A357943 The sequence is conjectured to contain all positive numbers. See A357944 for the index of where a given number first appears.
