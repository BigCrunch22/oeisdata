%N A357443 Inventory sequence, second version: record where the 1's, 2's, etc. are located starting with a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1.
%C A357443 Essentially the same as A358066, except that at stage k we record where all the numbers from 1 to 2^k have appeared in the sequence in earlier stages. (In A358066 we only look at where the numbers from 1 to k have appeared.)
%C A357443 This means that when the sequence is displayed as a triangle, the row corresponding to stage k >= 1 is a permutation of the numbers from 1 to 2^k.
%F A357443 a(n) = A356784(n-1) + 1. - _Rémy Sigrist_, Nov 08 2022
