%N A357765 Smallest positive integer that can be represented as the sum of n of its (possibly equal) divisors in the maximum number of ways (=A002966(n)).

%F A357765 a(n) = LCM of all denominators of Egyptian fractions enumerated by A002966(n).
%e A357765 a(3) = 12 since for n = 3 the tuples forming the solutions of 1 = 1/x_1 + 1/x_2 + 1/x_3 are (x_1, x_2, x_3) in {(2, 3, 6), (2, 4, 4), (3, 3, 3)}. All these terms combined have an lcm of 12. The ways to write 12 as a sum of 3 of its divisors are therefore 12 = 12/2 + 12/3 + 12/6 = 6 + 4 + 2. Similarily we have 12 = 6 + 3 + 3 and 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.
%Y A357765 Apparently coincides with A181700 for n >= 4.
