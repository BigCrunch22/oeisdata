%N A006778 Number of n-step spirals on hexagonal lattice.
%C A006778 The hexagonal lattice is the familiar 2-dimensional lattice in which each point has 6 neighbors. This is sometimes called the triangular lattice.
%C A006778 Corresponds to the Model III single spiral of Table 3 in Szekeres and Guttmann. In Model III every step of the walk consists of continuing in the current direction, turning clockwise by 120 degrees, or turning clockwise by 60 degrees. Roughly speaking, a "single spiral" is a self-avoiding clockwise walk that cannot get stuck in a dead end. More precisely, let u(i) denote the length of the successive straight-line segment of the walk with u(0)=0. If the angle turned is 120 degrees, then an extra u(j)=0 is inserted into the u sequence at that point. Then a walk with k straight line segments (including 0's as described), is a single spiral if u(i-4) + u(i-3) < u(i-1) + u(i) for 4 <= i <= k. - _Sean A. Irvine_, Apr 05 2022
