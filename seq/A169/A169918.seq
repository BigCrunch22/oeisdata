%N A169918 Squares in carryless arithmetic mod 10 with addition of digits defined to be multiplication mod 10 and multiplication of digits defined to be addition mod 10.
%C A169918 The rules of arithmetic used in A169916, A169917, A169918 have very strange consequences. Many of the familiar laws fail. For instance, the arithmetic in A169916 is not associative: 10*(9*2) = 10*1 = 21 != (10*9)*2 = 9*2 = 1.
