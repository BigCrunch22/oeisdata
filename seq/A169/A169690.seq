%N A169690 Let S be the sequence Fibonacci(2n), n>0 (cf. A001906); sequence lists the differences S(j)-S(i) for i<j.
%C A169690 The sequences S and T (see A169691) are a pair of sequences with the property that the differences between the terms of S are disjoint from the differences between the terms of T, thus answering a question posed by S. W. Golomb.
