%N A169903 Primitive primes in carryless arithmetic mod 10.
%C A169903 Define the units in carryless arithmetic mod 10 to be the numbers 1, 3, 7 and 9 (these divide any number). A prime is a number N, not a unit, whose only factorizations are of the form N = u * M, where u is a unit.
%C A169903 A prime is primitive if it is not the carryless product of a smaller prime and a unit.
%C A169903 A subsequence of A169887.
