%N A169655 Numbers k such that 2^k is in A054861.
%C A169655 For a prime p, we call a number p-compact if the exponent of p in the factorization of the number is a power of two. However, if m=k!, then not all exponents of p of the form 2^t are possible. The sequence lists numbers t in possible exponents of the form 2^t of 3 in 3-compact factorials k!The question of description of the p-compact factorials is interesting since there exists only finite set of factorials compact over both 2 and an arbitrary fixed odd prime (cf. A177436). On the other hand, there exist infinitely many 2-compact factorials. However, up to now it is unknown, whether exist infinitely many p-compact factorials for a fixed odd prime p. It is expected that the answer to be in affirmative.
