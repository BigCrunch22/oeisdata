%N A169864 The sequence S of a pair S, T generalizing Golomb's sequence A001462 and the pair A093848, A169863. See Comments for definition.
%C A169864 S is built with the rules [1] that you cannot insert any integer between two "touching" runs (run 1,3 is followed by 4,6,8,10,12; there is no integer between 3 and 4) and [2] that S and T share no integer.
%C A169864 T encodes the instructions for S.
%C A169864 It is not quite clear to me if T is the complement of S, or is merely disjoint from it.
%Y A169864 Cf. A169865, A001462, A093848, A169863, A169866, A169867.
