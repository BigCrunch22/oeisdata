%N A169641 Start with n, apply the map k -> A169639(k) until trajectory converges; sequence give full list of the 20 possible limit points.
%C A169641 There is a slight ambiguity in the definition, but I believe these are all the numbers which eventually return to themselves under iteration of k -> A169639(k). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jun 11 2021
