%N A169696 Number of undirected Knight's tours on a 3 X n board.
%C A169696 I think the (old) name "Number of open Knight's tours on a 3 X n board" is somewhat incorrect, because included are those tours in which the start/end cells are knight-neighbors. Such tours are potentially closed, although actually closing them would deprive them of specific start/end cells. "Number of undirected Knight's tours on a 3 X n board" would be a better name. For example the 3x10 has 3048 undirected tours, which would be 6096 directed tours, in accord with Colin Rose results (http://www.tri.org.au/knightframe.html, Solutions:3xm). Note that the 3x10 also has 16 closed tours (A169764 Number of closed Knight's tours on a 3 X n board), and each of those closed tour appears 30 times among the 3048 undirected tours, and 60 times among the 6096 directed tours. - _Pierre Charland_, Feb 15 2011
