%N A169612 Powers of 2 added sequentially to an initial value of 1 in producing A168612, which is a greedy listing of numbers all relatively prime to each other in binary.
%C A169612 The last term is a(552) = 16001. Any larger additional power of 2 added yields a number divisible by a prime no larger than 257 that is already included as a factor.
%C A169612 First computed using the online Java program in the links; the below PARI program computes all terms in about 45 seconds. - _James G. Merickel_, Aug 08 2015

%e A169612 a(5) = 8 means that with a(1)-a(4) known to be 1, 2, 4 and 5 -- corresponding to the relatively prime values 3 = 1 + 2^1, 7 = 3 + 2^2, 23 = 7 + 2^4 and 55 = 23 + 2^5 -- 55 + 2^6 = 119 has a factor of 7 and 55 + 2^7 = 183 has a factor of 3, but 55 + 2^8 = 311 is relatively prime to all of 3, 7, 23 and 55.
