%N A169786 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is number of cells that turn from OFF to ON at stage k of the growth of the obtuse triangle of hexagons described in the comment.
%C A169786 Consider the tiling of the plane by hexagons, where each cell has 6 neighbors, as in the A151723, A151724, A170905, A170906.
%C A169786 Assume the hexagons are oriented so that each one has a pair of vertical edges.
%C A169786 We label the cells in the usual way by Eisenstein integers, complex numbers r+sw, where r,s in Z, w = exp(2 pi i / 3) (see Conway and Sloane, pp. 52-53).
%C A169786 Initially all cells are OFF.
%C A169786 For x >= 1, define a roughly triangular region B_x by declaring the cells {sw: s >= 1}, {r-w: r >= -1}, {x-1-i+iw: 0 <= i <= x-2}, {x-1-i+(i+1)w: 0 <= i <= x-3} to be permanently OFF.
%C A169786 In other words, B_x consists of 0 plus the cells {r+sw: 0 <= s <= x-3, 1 <= r <= x-s-2}.
%C A169786 At stage 1, the "corner" cell 0 is turned ON; thereafter, a cell in B_x is turned ON if it has exactly one ON neighbor. Once a cell is ON it stays ON.
%C A169786 T(n,k) is the number of cells in B_{2^n} that are turned from OFF to ON at stage k (1 <= k <= 2^n-1).
%C A169786 Row n has 2^n-1 terms.
