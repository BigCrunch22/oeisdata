%N A169917 Squares in carryless arithmetic mod 10 with addition and multiplication of digits both defined to be multiplication mod 10.
%C A169917 The rules of arithmetic used in A169916, A169917, A169918 have very strange consequences. Many of the familiar laws fail. For instance, the arithmetic in A169916 is not associative: 10*(9*2) = 10*1 = 21 != (10*9)*2 = 9*2 = 1.

%F A169917 a(n) = a(n') if the i-th digit of n' either equals the i-th digit of n or (10 - the i-th digit of n): e.g., a(12345) = a(18365), because the 2nd and 4th digit of 12345 equal 10-(the 2nd resp. 4th digit of 18365), and the other digits are the same. In particular, a(10k+5+m) = a(10k+5-m), for m=0,...,4. - _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 26 2015
