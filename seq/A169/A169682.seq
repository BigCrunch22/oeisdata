%N A169682 Golomb-type sequence over primes.
%C A169682 Suggested by Golomb's sequence A001462.
%C A169682 Terms are primes in nondecreasing order; a(n) gives length of n-th run.
%C A169682 It is understood that a(n) is taken to be the smallest number >= a(n-1) which is compatible with the description.
