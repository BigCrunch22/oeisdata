%N A169819 a(n) = total number of distinct divisors of n and all of its substrings.
%C A169819 Note that we are counting 0 when it occurs as a digit of n, but are not counting any other integers as divisors of 0. (If we did, there would be infinitely many of them; every integer divides 0.) [From _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, May 29 2010]
%e A169819 a(56) = 11 because divisors of 56 are d1= {1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56}; 56 has two substrings 5,6; divisors of 5 are d2= {1, 5}, and divisors of 6 are d3= {1, 2, 3,6} ; union of d1,d2,d3 gives 11 distinct divisors of 56 and all of its substrings: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 14, 28, 56}.
%t A169819 Table[id = IntegerDigits[n]; FLA = Flatten[Table[Partition[id, k, 1], {k, Length[id]}], 1]; fd = Union[FromDigits /@ FLA]; dv = Length[Union[Flatten[Divisors /@ fd]]], {n, 200}]
