%N A169935 Numbers n such that for some k>0, n*k=1 in the arithmetic defined in A169918.
%C A169935 These would be the units if the structure formed a ring (which it does not).
%e A169935 22 is a member since 22*88 = 1. So is 23 since 23*8 = 1. 10 is not a member, even though 10 divides 9, since 10*9 = 0.
