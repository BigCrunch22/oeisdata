%N A169748 A variation on Recam√°n's sequence A005132: see Comments for definition.
%C A169748 Sequences A169748-A169752 have the same structure. We start with two sequences A and B. Sequence A is taken to be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,..., while sequence B varies.
%C A169748 Here sequence B is also 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,....
%C A169748 We start with the first term of sequence A (which is 1).
%C A169748 To extend the sequence, we first try to subtract the next term of A from the current term, but that is allowed only if the result is a positive number not already in the sequence.
%C A169748 If that fails, we next try to subtract the next term of B from the current term, but again that is allowed only if the result is a positive number not already in the sequence.
%C A169748 Finally, if that fails, we add the next term of A to the current term (this may produce repeated terms, but that is allowed at this step).
