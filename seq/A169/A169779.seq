%N A169779 Partial sums of A170898.
%C A169779 On the hexagonal grid consider an infinite 60-degree wedge. A cell is turned ON if exactly one of its six neighbors is ON. We start with a single ON cell. An ON cell remains ON forever. The sequence counts the total number of ON states after n generations. The structure is also the tree that arises from one of the six spokes of the structure of A151723. For n >> 1 the structure looks like a quadrilateral formed by two scalene right triangles which are joined at their hypotenuses. - _Omar E. Pol_, Mar 06 2013
