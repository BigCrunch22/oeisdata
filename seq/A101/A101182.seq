%N A101182 Least positive integer that can be represented as the sum of a prime and a triangular number in exactly n ways.

%F A101182 a(n) = min{i such that i = A000040(j) + A000217(k) in n ways}.
%e A101182 a(0) = 1 because 1 is the smallest positive integer that cannot be represented as sum of a prime and a triangular number (since 2 is the smallest prime).
%e A101182 a(1) = 2 = 2 + 0; a(2) = 3 = 3 + 0 = 2 + 1; a(3) = 8 = 2 + 6 = 5 + 3 = 7 + 1.
