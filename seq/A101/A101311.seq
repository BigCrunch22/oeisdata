%N A101311 Decimal numbers n such that after possibly prefixing a leading 0 to n, the resulting number n' can be broken into 2 strings of the same length, n' = xy, such that x^2+y^2 = n.
%C A101311 Define a map s_2(n) as follows. If n has an even number of digits, say n = abcdef, the map is n -> s_2(n) := (ab)^2+(cd)^2+(ef)^2. If n has an odd number of digits, say n = abcde, the map is n -> s_2(n) = a^2+(bc)^2+(de)^2. The sequence {s_2(n), n >= 0} does not have its own entry in the OEIS because it begins {0, 1, ..., 9801, 1, 2, 5, ...} and agrees with A000290 for the first 100 terms. There are exactly three numbers such that s_2(n) = n, namely 1, 1233, 8833. - _N. J. A. Sloane_ and _Pieter Post_, May 11 2015
