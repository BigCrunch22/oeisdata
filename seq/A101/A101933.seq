%N A101933 Concatenate the first n positive integers written in binary (with each integer written so the most significant 1 is on the left and the concatenated string is from left to right, A030302). a(n) is the number of times n written in binary appears disjointedly in the concatenated string.
%C A101933 First occurrence of n: 1, 3, 6, 11, 14, 23, 30, 47, 60, 95, 126, 124, 223, 248, 252, 447, 863, 504, 895, 1008, 1020, 1016, 1919, 2044, 2032, 2040, 3839, 7159, 7871, 4080, 7679, 15855, 8160, 8184, 8176, 15839, ??, 16376, 16352, 16368, ..., to a limit of 25000.
