%N A101920 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of Schroeder paths of length 2n and having k up steps starting at an odd height.
%C A101920 A Schroeder path of length 2n is a lattice path starting from (0,0), ending at (2n,0), consisting only of steps U=(1,1) (up steps), D=(1,-1) (down steps) and H=(2,0) (level steps) and never going below the x-axis (Schroeder paths are counted by the large Schroeder numbers, A006318). Row sums are the large Schroeder numbers (A006318). Column 0 yields the odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers (A001519).
%F A101920 G.f.=G=G(t, z) satisfies tz(1-z)G^2-(1-3z+tz+z^2)G+1-z=0.
%e A101920 T(3,1)=8 because we have HUU'DD, UDUU'DD, UU'DDH, UU'DDUD, UHU'DD, UU'DHD, UU'HDD and UU'UDDD, the up steps starting at odd heights being shown with the prime sign.
