%N A101246 When this sequence is interleaved with its first differences and the resulting sequence is divided into blocks of 10 digits, each block contains 10 distinct digits. Each term is chosen to be the smallest that satisfies this property.
%C A101246 Is this sequence infinite?

%e A101246 Block 1---|Block 2---|Block 3---|etc.
%e A101246 After placing a(10) = 9234, digits 41 through 49 are
%e A101246 178569234, so digit 50 is 0 and this is the difference a(11)-a(10); therefore a(11) = 9234.
