%N A101207 For each prime power n, a(n) is the number of positive integers that have n as their greatest prime power.
%C A101207 a(n) is the number of occurrences of n in A034699.
%F A101207 a(1) = 1; a(p^k) = prod_{q <= p^k, q prime} { ceiling(k log p / log q) } / k when p prime, k >= 1, a(n) = 0 otherwise
%e A101207 a(4) = 2 since only 4 and 12 have 4 as their greatest prime power - all other multiples of 4 are divisible by 8, 9, or some prime >= 5.
%Y A101207 Cf. A034699.
