%N A101261 a(2n-1) = 1; a(2n) = a(n)th smallest positive integer not among the earlier terms of the sequence.
%C A101261 The sequence {a(2k)} forms a permutation of the integers >= 2.
%e A101261 a(12) = the a(6)th (the 3rd) smallest positive integer not among the first 11 terms of the sequence. Not among the first 11 terms are 6, 7, 9, 10,... The 3rd of these is 9, which is a(12).
