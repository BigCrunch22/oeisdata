%N A101319 a(1) = 1; a(n) = (largest odd divisor of a(n-1))th smallest positive integer not yet in the sequence.
%C A101319 It seems likely, but not certain, that this sequence is a permutation of the positive integers, which it is if and only if there are an infinite number of powers of 2 in the sequence.

%e A101319 a(6) = 12 and the highest odd divisor of 12 is 3. Among the first 6 terms of the sequence is not 4, 5, 8, 9, ... and the 3rd of these is 8, which is therefore a(7).
