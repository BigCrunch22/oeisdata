%N A101639 Positive integers n for which n = f(n), where f(n) is the total number of 2's required when writing out all numbers between 0 and n.
%C A101639 Related to a problem posed by Google and discussed on the MathWorld link.
%C A101639 This is the complete list of all 13 positive numbers n such that n is equal to the number of 2's in the decimal digits of all numbers <= n. - Daniel Hirschberg (dan(AT)ics.uci.edu), May 05 2007

%e A101639 a(1) = 28263827 since writing out all numbers from 0 to 28263827 requires that 28263827 2's be used and since 28263827 is the first such positive integer.
%e A101639 a(4) = 500000000 because the number of 2's in the decimal digits of the numbers from 1 to 500000000 is 500000000 and this is the 4th such number.
%Y A101639 Cf. A014778 for proof these sequences are finite; Also A101640, A101641, A130427, A130428, A130429, A130430, A130431; cf. A130432 for the number of numbers in these sequences.
