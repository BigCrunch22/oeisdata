%N A101083 Largest k such that the product (n+1)(n+2)...(n+k) has at least k distinct prime factors.
%C A101083 This sequence is based on a slightly weaker, but still unproved, version of Grimm's conjecture: If there is no prime in the interval [n+1, n+k], then the product (n+1)(n+2)...(n+k) has at least k distinct prime divisors. We have a(n) >= A059686(n), with the two sequences first differing at n=70. Computing a(n) is much faster than computing A059686.
%C A101083 It seems that Grimm's conjecture could have another (but not a weak) form: let p(1)...p(i) be a subset of prime numbers such that while n is an integer, 0 < n < i, for any n, p(n) < p(n+1). Then there exists such sequence c(1)...c(i) where each term is a composite number, c(n+1) = c(n) + 1, and c(n) == 0 (mod p(n)). - _Sergey Pavlov_, Mar 21 2017
