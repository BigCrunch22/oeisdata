%N A101919 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of Schroeder paths of length 2n and having k up steps starting at even heights.
%C A101919 A Schroeder path of length 2n is a lattice path starting from (0,0), ending at (2n,0), consisting only of steps U=(1,1) (up steps), D=(1,-1) (down steps) and H=(2,0) (level steps) and never going below the x-axis (Schroeder paths are counted by the large Schroeder numbers, A006318). Also number of Schroeder paths of length 2n and having k humps. A hump is an up step U followed by 0 or more level steps H followed by a down step D. The T(3,2)=8 Schroeder paths of length 6 and having 2 humps are: H(UD)(UD), (UD)H(UD), (UD)(UD)H, (UD)(UHD), (UD)(UUDD), (UHD)(UD), (UUDD)(UD) and U(UD)(UD)D, the humps being shown between parentheses. Row sums are the large Schroeder numbers (A006318). Column 1 yields the odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers minus 1 (A027941). T(n,n-1)=A034856(n)=binomial(n + 1, 2) + n - 1.
