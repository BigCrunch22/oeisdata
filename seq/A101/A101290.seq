%N A101290 Dissipation time for n under the following scheme: set f(0)=n, f(i)=0 for all i<>0, then iterate the evolutionary process by which f(i) is replaced by floor[(f(i-1)+f(i)+f(i+1))/3] for all i, with all calculations done in parallel. a(n) is the minimum number of iterations of this process required to reach f(i)=0 for all i, for n=0,1,2,3,...
%e A101290 If n=10, the process evolves as follows on [ -3,3], showing that a(10)=7:
