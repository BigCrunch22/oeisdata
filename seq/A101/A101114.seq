%N A101114 Let t(G) = number of unitary factors of the Abelian group G. Then a(n) = sum t(G) over all Abelian groups G of order <= n.
%C A101114 From Schmidt paper: Let A denote the set of all Abelian groups. Under the operation of direct product, A is a semigroup with identity element E, the group with one element. G_1 and G_2 are relatively prime if the only common direct factor of G_1 and G_2 is E. We say that G_1 and G_2 are unitary factors of G if G=G_1 X G_2 and G_1, G_2 are relatively prime. Let t(G) denote the number of unitary factors of G. Sequence gives T(n) = sum_{G in A, |G| <= n} t(G).
