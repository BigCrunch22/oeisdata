%N A101640 Positive integers n for which n = f(n), where f(n) is the total number of 3's required when writing out all numbers between 0 and n.
%C A101640 Related to a problem posed by Google and discussed on the MathWorld link.
%C A101640 Together with the b-file, this gives the complete list of all 35 positive numbers n such that n is equal to the number of 3's in the decimal digits of all numbers <= n. - Daniel Hirschberg (dan(AT)ics.uci.edu), May 05 2007

%e A101640 a(1) = 371599983, since writing out all numbers from 0 to 371599983 requires that 371599983 3's be used and since 371599983 is the first such positive integer.
%e A101640 a(4) = 371599986 because the number of 3's in the decimal digits of the numbers from 1 to 371599986 is 371599986 and this is the 4th such number.
%Y A101640 Cf. A014778 for proof these sequences are finite; Also A101639, A101641, A130427, A130428, A130429, A130430, A130431; cf. A130432 for the number of numbers in these sequences.
