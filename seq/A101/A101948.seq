%N A101948 For any n >= 0 and b >= 2, let k be the length of the base-b expansion of n and let M(n, b) be the 2 X k matrix whose first row contains the first k primes in descending order and whose second row contains the base-b expansion of n. Let f(n, b) = determinant[transpose(M(n, b))*M(n, b)]. Sequence gives f(n, 5).
%F A101948 For 0 <= x < b, 1 <= y < b, f(x, b) = x^2+4 and f(yb+x, b) = 4*x^2+9*y^2-12*x*y.
%F A101948 For n >= b^2, f(n, b) = 0.
%e A101948 M(21, 5) = [3,2; 4,1], so a(21) = det([3,4; 2,1]*[3,2; 4,1]) = det([25,10; 10,5]) = 25.
