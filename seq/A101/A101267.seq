%N A101267 a(1) = 1; a(n) = a(2^ceiling(log_2(n)) + 1 - n)th smallest positive integer not yet in the sequence.
%C A101267 Sequence is a permutation of the positive integers. 2^ceiling(log_2(n)) + 1 - n is sequence A080079 with a change of offset.

%e A101267 Since 2^ceiling(log_2(n)) +1 -n = 3 at n = 6, a(6) = the a(3)th (the 4th) smallest positive integer not among the first 5 terms of the sequence. The positive integers not among the first 5 terms are 5,6,8,9,10,... The 4th of these is 9, which is a(6).
