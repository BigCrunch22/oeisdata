%N A101227 Number of solutions to equation n=x+largest digit of x, n>1.
%C A101227 In A045844, a sequence is defined by a rule a(n+1) = a(n) + largest digit of a(n); a(0) = 1. As usually in such cases, direct transformation is unique, while reverse one is not. Here the number of possible "previous" terms is given for each n.
%e A101227 a(12)=2 because 12=6+6 and 12=11+1; a(101)=2 because 101=92+9 and 101=100+1; note offset=2.
