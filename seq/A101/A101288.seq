%N A101288 The number of primes between the n-th isolated prime and n-th isolated composite.
%C A101288 Instead of "isolated" one speaks also of "single" primes, they are listed in A007510 and include 2 by convention. By isolated composites are meant composites whose two neighbors both are prime, i.e., the averages of twin primes, A014574. - _M. F. Hasler_, Aug 11 2015
%e A101288 a(1) = 1 = # { 3 }, the only prime between 2 (the first "isolated prime" according to A007510) and 4, the first "isolated composite" in the sense that x-1 and x+1 both are primes.
%e A101288 a(2) = 5 = # { 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 }, the primes between the second isolated prime, 23, and second isolated composite, 6.
%e A101288 a(3) = 6 = # { 31, 29, 23, 19, 17, 13 }, the primes between A007510(3) = 37 and A014574(3) = 12.
