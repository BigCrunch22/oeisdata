%N A101857 Number of possibly-self-intersecting walks that it is possible for an accelerating ant to produce with n steps (rotations & reflections not included). On step 1 the ant moves forward 1 unit, then turns left or right and proceeds 2 units, then turns left or right until at the end of its n-th step it arrives back at its starting place.
%C A101857 Accelerating ant walks can only arrive back at the starting place if the number of moves is -1 or 0 mod(8).
%e A101857 a(7) = 1 because of the following solution:

%e A101857 6XXXXXXX2
%e A101857 777777712
%e A101857 where the ant starts at the "1" and moves right 1 space, up 2 spaces and so on...
