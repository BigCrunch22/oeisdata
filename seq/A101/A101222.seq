%N A101222 Slowest increasing sequence where the absolute difference between the last digit of a(n) and the first digit of a(n+1) equals 1.
%C A101222 This is the slowest growing such sequence in the limiting sense; any other such sequence b must eventually have b(n) > a(n) for sufficiently large n. It is not the slowest growing in the greedy or lexical sense. "Slowest growing" in this sense does not necessarily exist for arbitrary properties, but it does in this case. - _Franklin T.
