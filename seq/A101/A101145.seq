%N A101145 List of molecules in Hintze-Adami artificial chemistry (see comments for definition).
%C A101145 These molecules are composed of three types of atoms called 1, 2 and 3. The atoms are arranged linearly. Each atom shares bonds with the adjacent atoms. Each atom must carry as many bonds as the numeral representing it.
%C A101145 The members of this sequence are arranged in numerical order.
%C A101145 The reference states that the molecules "are numbered according to their complexity (length and type of atoms)", which is ambiguous.
%C A101145 For n > 2 there are fibonacci(n+1) members of length n.
%C A101145 Hintze and Adami arbitrarily chose a maximum length of 12, resulting in 608 total members; the last is 233333333332.
%C A101145 All terms are divisible by 11.
%H A101145 Arend Hintze and Christoph Adami, <a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/0705.4674">Evolution of complex modular biological networks</a>. Page 3 defines the set of valid molecules; p. 17 lists a(0) through a(5) and a(607).
%e A101145 Using "-" to represent single bonds and "=" to represent double bonds, some members are a(0) = 1-1, a(4) = 2=3-1 and a(607) = 2=3-3=3-3=3-3=3-3=3-3=2.
%e A101145 2222 is not a member because the first 2 must share two bonds with the second 2, so the second 2 has no bonds left to share with the third 2.
%Y A101145 Cf. A000045.
