%N A101543 Triangle read by rows: First row = 2; n-th row (n>1) has n smallest positive integers not yet in the sequence such that each integer has a prime divisor in common with at least one element of the (n-1)st row.
%C A101543 Is this a permutation of the integers >= 2?
%C A101543 It appears that for n > 2, row n+1 always begins with the primes p such that 2p appears in row n and the rest of row n+1 consists of the smallest composite numbers not already used. The only way this pattern can break down is if we have to skip a composite number because it doesn't share a factor with any number in the previous row. Let f(n) be the last number in row n. To prove that this pattern continues, it suffices to show that f(n) < (f(n-1)-f(n-2)+1)^2, because the prime factors of row n-1 include all primes <= f(n-1)-f(n-2) and any composite number x has a prime factor <= sqrt(x). I have checked that f(n) < (f(n-1)-f(n-2)+1)^2 for all n up to 10000. In fact for 1000 < n <= 10000, f(n) < (f(n-1)-f(n-2)-300)^2. - _David Wasserman_, Mar 27 2008
%e A101543 7 is in the 5th row because it does not occur earlier and 14 is in the 4th row.
