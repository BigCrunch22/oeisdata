%N A101647 Atomic numbers of elements excluding metals, halogens, and noble gases in the periodic table.
%C A101647 "Nonmetals" as normally understood in elementary chemistry.
%C A101647 All nonmetals are sandwiched between the halogens and metalloids on the periodic table, with the exception of hydrogen, which is on the same group as the alkali metals. - Happelberg
%C A101647 There may appear to be some disagreement in regards to the definition of nonmetals. This sequence appears on the cover of the Halka and Nordstrom book on nonmetals, and that book has eight chapters, the first seven of which are each devoted to an element identified by this sequence.
%C A101647 The Baldwin book, on the other hand, flatly declares "All elements to the right of the stepped line [on the periodic table shown in that book] are nonmetals," meaning that the author also considers halogens and noble gases to be nonmetals.
%C A101647 But then there is the Halka and Nordstrom book on halogens and noble gases, which says "The halogens ... are nonmetals, but have such special properties that they are given their own classification. The same is true for the noble gases." - _Alonso del Arte_, Apr 26 2011
