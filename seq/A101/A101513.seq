%N A101513 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 3; triangle where n-th row has lowest n positive integers not yet in the sequence such that each integer has a prime divisor in common with at least one element of the (n-1)th row.
%C A101513 Is this a permutation of the positive integers?
%C A101513 Conjectures from _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 22 2005: (Start)
%C A101513 "Call a number "postponed" if it cannot be placed right away, that is, if it is relatively prime to the numbers in the previous row. Then I conjecture that:
%C A101513 "(1) a number n >= 4 is postponed iff n is prime,
%C A101513 "(2) every number appears,
%C A101513 "(3) the primes appear in order,
%C A101513 "(4) 2p (p prime) will appear in one row and p will appear in the next row,
%C A101513 "(5) let c(i) = A018252(i) be the i-th nonprime and define a sequence k(n) [see A104655], n >= 3, by k(3) = 4 and for n >= 4, n*(n+1)/2 = pi( floor( c(k(n-1))/2 ) ) + k(n). Then the final term in row n, for n >= 3, is c(k(n)) [A104656]." (End)
