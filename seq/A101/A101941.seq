%N A101941 Peak-trough transform of the omega sequence (A001221).
%C A101941 I define the peak-trough transform b(n) of sequence a(n) as follows. If a(n) is greater than both of its immediate neighbors, b(n) is defined as the largest k such that a(n) is greater than its k nearest neighbors both before and after it in the sequence. (a(n) is said to be a k-peak of the sequence). If a(n) is smaller than both of its immediate neighbors, b(n) is defined as -k, where k is the largest k such that a(n) is smaller than its k nearest neighbors both before and after it in the sequence. (a(n) is said to be a k-trough of the sequence). Otherwise, a(n) is 0. (Note difference between a k-peak and a k-apex as defined by Joseph L. Pe in A076759).
