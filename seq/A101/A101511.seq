%N A101511 The first 2 digits of the sequence form a prime number (23), the next 3 digits form a prime number (457), the next 4 also (8923), the next 5 also (24373), the next 7 also (8394151), the next 8 also (52535471), etc., with a(n) < a(n+1).
%C A101511 Primes involved are 23, 457, 8923, 24373, 8394151, 52535471, 727374757, 89, 193, 97, 9811, 113, 1132139, 149, 15115417, 317, 417517819, 1193, 2, 11213, 2, 15217, 23, 12323, 113, 12323; the number of digits of each prime, here, give the digits of exactly the sequence above: 2 3 4 5 7 8 9 2 3 2 4 3 7 3 8 3 9 4 1 5 1 5 2 5 3 5 ... The first available primes were chosen and chunked so as to force [a(n+1) - a(n)] to be minimal.
