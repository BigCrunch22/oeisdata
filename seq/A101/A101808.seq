%N A101808 Number of primes between two consecutive even numbers.
%F A101808 a(n)=A101264(n), n>1. [From _R. J. Mathar_, Dec 13 2008]
%e A101808 a(1)=2 because between 2 and 4 there are two primes: 2,3;
%e A101808 a(2)=1 because between 4 and 6 there is one prime: 5;
%e A101808 a(4)=0 because between 8 and 10 there are no primes.
