%N A101217 Base-4 representation of positive integers whose base-2 run-length representation is the same as their base-4 representation.
%e A101217 The base-2 run-length representation 11313 represents the base-2 number 101110111, which is 375 (base 10). But 375 = 11313 (base 4); thus 11313 is a term of the sequence.
