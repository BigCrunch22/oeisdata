%N A101236 Smallest i such that i*2^(2)-1, ..., i*2^(n+2)-1 are primes.
%C A101236 (2^2)*3-1=11, (2^3)*3-1=23 and (2^4)*3-1=47 are primes so 3 is the third entry.
%C A101236 For every x in A001122, the x-th term of this sequence and every succeeding term is divisible by x. For example 3 divides the 3rd and every succeeding term, 5 divides the 5th and every succeeding term.
%C A101236 The sequences of primes generated by these numbers are a type of Cunningham chain of the first kind (CC1). Since the longest known CC1 chain is of length 16, the next terms are currently unknown. - Douglas Stones (dssto1(AT)student.monash.edu.au), Mar 16 2005
