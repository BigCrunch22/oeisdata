%N A101051 Numbers m such that Sum_{p prime|m} p^r(p) = m, where r(p) is the least positive primitive root of p (A001918).
%C A101051 Most terms m of the sequence have k = omega(m) = 1, only 132 and 16371 with k=3 are found. Further searches did not find any more terms with k >= 3. k has to be odd in any case, this can be easily seen by looking at the parity of the prime factors. Perhaps someone with a stronger computer can find more numbers with k>1, if there are any. [There are no other terms that are not prime powers among the first 1000 terms. - _Amiram Eldar_, Sep 25 2021]
