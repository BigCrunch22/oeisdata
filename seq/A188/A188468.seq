%C A188468 Is this the same as A188016 plus a 4? - _R. J. Mathar_, Apr 05 2011
%C A188468 Answer: yes. These are the positions of 1 in A188014, which is obtained from A188467 by applying [-x]=-[x]-1 to [4r-nr], where [.] is the floor function, and r the golden mean. The extra 4 is explained by noting that  [-x]=-[x]-1 does not hold for integer x. - _Michel Dekking_, Oct 04 2016
