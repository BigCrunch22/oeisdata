%C A188943 From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Aug 29 2022: (Start)
%C A188943 This constant t is an element of the quadratic number field Q(sqrt(13)) with (monic) polynomial x^2 - (7/3)*x + 1, and the negative root is -A188942.
%C A188943 The constant t - 1 = (1 + sqrt(13))/6 = A209927/3 has minimal polynomial x^2 - x/3 - 1/3, with negative root -(-1 + sqrt(13))/6 = -A223139/3 = -A356033.
