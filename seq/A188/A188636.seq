%N A188636 Decimal expansion of length/width of a metasilver rectangle.
%C A188636 A metasilver rectangle is introduced here as a rectangle such that if a silver rectangle is removed from one end, the remaining rectangle is metasilver.  Recall that a rectangle is silver if the removal of 2 squares from one end leaves a rectangle having the same shape s=(length/width) as the original.  This metasilver ratio is given by

%C A188636 s=[r,r,r,r...], a periodic continued fraction, r=1+sqrt(2);
%C A188636 s=[2,1,3,2,3,2,7,1,1,114,11,1,2,1,...], as at A188637.
