%N A188432 Fixed point of the morphism 0->001, 1->01.
%C A188432 This is column 1 of the array A188294.
%C A188432 Is this A003849 with another 0 in front? - _R. J. Mathar_, Apr 01 2011
%C A188432 From _Michel Dekking_, Aug 27 2016: (Start)
%C A188432 Answer: yes. Since [-x] = -[x]-1 for all non-integer x, one has for n > 1:
%C A188432 [r] - [nr] - [(1-n)r] = 1 - [nr] + [(n-1)r] + 1 = 2 - ([nr]-[(n-1)r]) = A003849(n-2). (End)
%C A188432 Also, [ns] - [(n-1)s] where s = (3-sqrt(5))/2, therefore a Sturmian sequence with slope s.  Also, a fixed point under the transformation (0 ->001, 1 -> 01). - _Richard Blavy_, Nov 18 2011; transformation corrected by _Nathan Fox_, May 03 2014
%F A188432 a(n) = [r] - [n*r] - [r-n*r], where r = (1+sqrt(5))/2.
%t A188432 r = (1 + 5^(1/2))/2 + .0000000000001;
%t A188432 f[n_] := Floor[r] - Floor[n*r] - Floor[r - n*r]
%t A188432 t = Flatten[Table[f[n], {n, 1, 200}]] (* A188432 *)
%t A188432 Flatten[Position[t, 0] ]  (* A026351 *)
