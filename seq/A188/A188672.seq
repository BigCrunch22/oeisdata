%N A188672 a(n) is the least r > 1 for which the interval (r*n, r*(n+1)) contains no prime powers (p^k, k >= 1), or a(n) = 0 if no such r exists.
%C A188672 Conjecture: a(n) = 0, iff n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 24, 56.
%C A188672 A proof that the interval(r*n, r*(n+1)) for r > 1 always contains a term from A000961 for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 24, 56 uses methods based on the corresponding analog of Ramanujan numbers (cf. A228592) and their generalization.
%F A188672 If a(n)*A228518(n) is not 0, then a(n) >= A228518(n).
%Y A188672 Cf. A000961, A218831, A228518, A228592.
