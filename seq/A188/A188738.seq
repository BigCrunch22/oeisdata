%C A188738 Decimal expansion of the shape of a lesser 2e-contraction rectangle.
%C A188738 The shape of a rectangle WXYZ, denoted by [WXYZ], is defined by length/width: [WXYZ]=max{|WX|/|YZ|, |YZ|/|WX|}.  Consider the following configuration of rectangles AEFD, EBCF, ABCD, where AEFD is not a square:
%C A188738 D................F....C
%C A188738 .......................
%C A188738 .......................
%C A188738 .......................
%C A188738 A................E....B
%C A188738 Suppose that ABCD is given and that the shape r=[ABCD] exceeds 2.  The "r-contraction rectangles" of ABCD are here introduced as the rectangles AEFD and EBCF for which [AEFD]=[EBCF] and |AE|<>|EB|.  That is, ABCD has the prescribed shape r, and AEFD and EBCF are mutually similar without being congruent.  It is easy to prove that [AEFD]=(1/2)(r-sqrt(-4+r^2)) or [AEFD]=(1/2)(r+sqrt(-4+r^2)); in the former case, we call AEFD the "lesser r-contraction rectangle", and the latter, the "greater r-contraction rectangle".
%C A188738 Both r-contraction rectangles match the continued fraction of [AEFD] in the following way.  Write the continued fraction as [a(1),a(2),a(3),...].  Then, in the manner in which the continued fraction [1,1,1,...] matches the step-by-step removal of single squares from a golden triangle (as well as the manner in which the continued fraction [2,2,2,...] matches the step-by-step removal of 2 squares at a time from a silver triangle, etc.), remove a(1) squares at step 1, then remove a(2) squares at step 2, and so on, obtaining in the limit a partition of AEFD as an infinite set of squares.
