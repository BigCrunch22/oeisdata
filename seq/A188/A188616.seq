%N A188616 Decimal expansion of angle B of unique side-golden and angle-silver triangle.
%C A188616 Let r=(golden ratio)=(1+sqrt(5))/2 and u=(silver ratio)=1+sqrt(2).  A triangle ABC with sidelengths a,b,c is side-golden if a/b=r and angle-silver if C/B=u.  There is a unique triangle that has both properties.  The quickest way to understand the geometric reasons for the names is by analogy to the golden and silver rectangles.  For the former, exactly 1 square is available at each stage of the partitioning of the rectangle into a nest of squares, and for the former, exactly 2 squares are available.  Analogously, for ABC, exactly one 1 triangle of a certain kind is available at each stage of a side-partitioning procedure, and exactly 2 triangles of another kind are available for angle-partitioning.  For details, see the 2007 reference.
