%N A188885 Decimal expansion of (1+sqrt(1+e^2))/e.
%C A188885 Decimal expansion of the length/width ratio of a (2/e)-extension rectangle.  See A188640 for definitions of shape and r-extension rectangle.
%C A188885 A (2/e)-extension rectangle matches the continued fraction [1,2,3,3,1,15,1,3,7,1,2,4,...] for the shape L/W=(1+sqrt(1+e^2))/e.  This is analogous to the matching of a golden rectangle to the continued fraction [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,...].  Specifically, for the (2/e)-extension rectangle, 1 square is removed first, then 2 squares, then 3 square2, then 3 squares,..., so that the original rectangle of shape (1+sqrt(1+e^2))/e is partitioned into an infinite collection of squares.
