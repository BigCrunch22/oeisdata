%N A188543 Decimal expansion of the angle B in the doubly silver triangle ABC.
%C A188543 There is a unique (shape of) triangle ABC that is both side-silver and angle-silver. Its angles are B, t*B and pi-B-t*B, where t is the silver ratio, 1+sqrt(2), at A014176. "Side-silver" and "angle-silver" refer to partitionings of ABC, each in a manner that matches the continued fraction [2,2,2,...] of t.  For doubly golden and doubly e-ratio triangles, see A152149 and A188544.  For the side partitioning and angle partitioning (i,e, constructions in which 2 triangles are removed at each stage, analogous to the removal of 1 square at each stage of the partitioning of the golden rectangle into squares) which match arbitrary continued fractions (of sidelength ratios and angle ratios), see the 2007 reference.
