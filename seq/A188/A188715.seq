%N A188715 Minimal largest k in set of n fractions of the form (k-1)/k all of whose ratios (smaller fraction / larger fraction) are also of that form.
%C A188715 These ratios, together with 1, can be the constant speeds of cyclists going forever around a circular track while only allowed to pass each other at a single point.
%C A188715 For all n, a(n+1)<a(n)^(2n), so the series is infinite. [_John Tromp_, Apr 13 2011]
%e A188715 All pairwise ratios in the set {5/6,4/5,3/4,2/3} are also of the form (k-1)/k, while for the only "lesser" size-4 set {4/5,3/4,2/3,1/2}, we have (1/2)/(4/5)=5/8 is not of that form. So a(4)=6.

%A A188715 _John Tromp_, Apr 08 2011
%E A188715 Finally found a(11); about the square of a(10). I doubt if a(12) will ever be found.
