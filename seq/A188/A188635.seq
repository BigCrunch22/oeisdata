%N A188635 Continued fraction expansion of length/width of metagolden rectangle.
%C A188635 The metagolden rectangle is introduced here as a rectangle such that if a golden rectangle is removed from one end, the remaining rectangle is metagolden. That is, using mu to represent the metagolden ratio, mu - phi = 1/mu, so that when the phi X 1 golden rectangle is removed, the remaining rectangle is 1/mu X 1, the same metagolden shape as the original mu X 1 rectangle. - _Geoffrey Caveney_, Apr 20 2014
%C A188635 (Recall that a rectangle is golden if the removal of a square from one end leaves a rectangle having the same shape as the original.)
%C A188635 To generalize, suppose that a rectangle R of length L and width W is to be partitioned into a set of squares. One way to do this matches the ordinary continued fraction of the shape (defined as L/W). Explicitly, if L/W = [a(0), a(1), a(2), ...] (finite or infinite), then a(0) squares are removed in step 1, then a(1) squares in step 2, then a(2) squares, and so on.  An example is the golden rectangle, of shape [1,1,1,...].
%C A188635 To generalize from squares to rectangles all having a common shape s >= 1, in such a manner that a(n) of these rectangles are removed at step k, the original rectangle must have shape given by the continued fraction [s*a(0), s*a(1), s*a(2), ...]. This result follows easily from the Euclidean algorithm for two positive real numbers (as in the paper cited below on golden triangles, generalized to match continued fractions). Here, the terms of the continued fraction need not be integers, and by Seidel's theorem of 1846, the continued fraction converges (e.g., Roberts, pages 97-105). We shall refer to the geometric partitioning of the original rectangle as the continued fraction partition (matching the continued fraction [s*a(0), s*a(1), s*a(2), ...]).
%C A188635 Thus, the constant at A136319 is the shape of a rectangle whose continued fraction partition is an infinite collection of golden rectangles.
