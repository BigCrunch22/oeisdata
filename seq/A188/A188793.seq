%N A188793 Start with 1 and 5, then repeatedly adjoin the smallest number that is greater than the last term and not equal to the sum of a subset of the existing terms.
%C A188793 All terms after a(3) are of the form 10*3^k +/- 1.
%C A188793 From _Nathaniel Johnston_, Apr 10 2011: (Start)
%C A188793 The fact that, after a(3), a term is in this sequence if and only if it is of the form 10*3^k +/- 1 can be proved by induction:
%C A188793 Suppose the sequence contains subsets that sum to every number from 5 to 10*3^k + 3, excluding 10*3^k - 1, 10*3^k, and 10*3^k + 1 (this is easily verified in the k = 0 case with the sequence 1, 5, 7). Then 10*3^k - 1 is added to the sequence, 10*3^k is not added to the sequence (because 10*3^k - 1 + 1 = 10*3^k), and 10*3^k + 1 is added to the sequence (because 2 is not a sum of a subset of terms).
%C A188793 After these two new terms have been added to the sequence, there are subset sums for:
%C A188793 (1) any number from 5 to 10*3^k + 3 (by inductive hypothesis),
%C A188793 (2) any number from (10*3^k - 1) + 5 = 10*3^k + 4 to (10*3^k - 1) + 10*3^k + 3 = 20*3^k + 2 (excluding 20*3^k - 2, 20*3^k - 1, and 20*3^k, because we added 10*3^k - 1 to the sequence),
%C A188793 (3) any number from (10*3^k + 1) + 5 = 10*3^k + 6 to (10*3^k + 1) + 10*3^k + 3 = 20*3^k + 4 (excluding 20*3^k, 20*3^k + 1, and 20*3^k + 2, because we added 10*3^k + 1 to the sequence),
%C A188793 (4) 20*3^k ( = (10*3^k - 1) + (10*3^k + 1)), and
%C A188793 (5) any number from 5 + (10*3^k - 1) + (10*3^k + 1) = 20*3^k + 5 to (10*3^k + 3) + (10*3^k - 1) + (10*3^k + 1) = 30*3^k + 3 = 10*3^(k+1) + 3, excluding 10*3^(k+1) - 1, 10*3^(k+1), and 10*3^(k+1) + 1.
%C A188793 It follows that the sequence now contains subsets that sum to every number from 5 to 10*3^(k+1) + 3, excluding 10*3^(k+1) - 1, 10*3^(k+1), and 10*3^(k+1) + 1, which completes the induction. (End)
