%N A188928 Decimal expansion of sqrt(12)+sqrt(13).
%C A188928 Decimal expansion of the length/width ratio of a sqrt(48)-extension rectangle.  See A188640 for definitions of shape and r-extension rectangle.
%C A188928 A sqrt(48)-extension rectangle matches the continued fraction [7,14,2,1,4,21,3,9,1,4,2,1,1,1,2,...] for the shape L/W=sqrt(12)+sqrt(13).  This is analogous to the matching of a golden rectangle to the continued fraction [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,...].  Specifically, for the sqrt(48)-extension rectangle, 7 squares are removed first, then 14 squares, then 2 squares, then 1 square,..., so that the original rectangle of shape sqrt(12)+sqrt(13) is partitioned into an infinite collection of squares.
