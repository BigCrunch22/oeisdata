%N A188467 [4r]-[nr]-[4r-nr], where r=(1+sqrt(5))/2 and [.]=floor.
%C A188467 See A188294.  First differs from A078588 at the 38th term.
%C A188467 (a(n)) is essentially the same as A188014 and also as A187950. The second sequence is a shift of (a(n)), and the first sequence is obtained by applying [-x]=[x]-1 for all non-integer x. This gives a(n) = 1-A188014(n) for all n not equal to 4. - _Michel Dekking_, Oct 04 2016
