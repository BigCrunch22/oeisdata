%N A217437 Number of strings of length n in {2,3}* for which at least one of tail(2 S) > tail(S) and tail(3 S) > tail(S) holds.
%C A217437 The "curling number" k = k(S) of a string of numbers S = s(1), ..., s(m) is defined as follows. Write S as XY^k for strings X and Y (where Y has positive length) and k is maximized, i.e. k = the maximal number of repeating blocks at the end of S.
%C A217437 The "tail length" tail(S) of S is defined as follows: start with S and repeatedly append the curling number (recomputing it at each step) until a 1 is reached; tail(S) is the number of terms that are appended to S before a 1 is reached.
%C A217437 No example is known where both tail(2 S) > tail(S) and tail(3 S) > tail(S) hold.

%e A217437 Tail(22322)=2, tail(222322)=8, tail(322322)=2, so 22322 is counted in a(5).
