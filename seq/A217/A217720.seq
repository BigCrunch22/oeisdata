%N A217720 Number of one-sided polydrafters with n cells.
%C A217720 A polydrafter is a plane figure formed by joining equal triangles with angles of 30, 60, and 90 degrees with certain restrictions on how they are joined.  See A056842 for details.  One-sided means that distinct mirror images are counted separately.
%C A217720 For odd n, an n-drafter cannot have mirror symmetry, so odd entries in this sequence are double those in A056842.

%e A217720 There are 6 two-sided didrafters, two have distinct mirror images, so there are 8 one-sided didrafters. Thus a(2) = 8.
%Y A217720 Cf. A056842 (number of two-sided polydrafters).
