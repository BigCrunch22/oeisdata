%N A217877 Triangle read by rows: minimum inversion terminator in rooted labeled trees.
%C A217877 T(n,k) is the number of trees on vertex set [0,n-1], rooted at 0, with minimum inversion terminator = k if k>=1, with no inversion terminators if k=0. An inversion is a pair i,j of vertices with j a descendant of i and i>j; j is then an inversion terminator.

%F A217877 T(n,0) = (n-1)!, T(n,k) = k!*(n-k-1)*n^(n-k-2) for 1<=k<=n-2.
%F A217877 Proof. For any given increasing tree T on [0,k], the number of rooted-at-0 trees on [0,n-1] that contain T is (k+1)n^(n-k-2) [J. W. Moon, Counting Labelled Trees (1970), Sec. 6.2]. Hence, since there are k! increasing trees on [0,k] [R. H. Stanley, Enumerative Combinatorics, Vol. 1, (1986), Sec. 1.3.16], the number of trees on [0,n-1] that contain *some* increasing tree on [0,k] is (k+1)!n^(n-k-2). But the minimum inversion terminator is k precisely when the tree contains some increasing tree on [0,k-1] but none on [0,k]. The number of such trees is therefore k!n^(n-k-1) - (k+1)!n^(n-k-2) = T(n,k) (for k>=1). QED.
%F A217877 This gives a nice combinatorial interpretation of the identity n^(n-2) = (n-1)! + Sum_{k=1..n-2} k!(n-k-1)n^(n-k-2). The identity is easy to establish analytically, of course, because the sum is telescoping.
