%N A217377 a(n) is the smallest m>=0 such that ((5n+1)*6^m-1)/5 is prime; or -1 if no such value exists.
%C A217377 Let f(n)=6n+1. Let f(n,m) be f applied to n m-times. For example f(n,3) = f(f(f(n))). Then a(n) is the smallest m>=0 such that f(n,m) is prime.
%C A217377 a(525)=27871 is the largest found value in this sequence, which generates a probable prime with 21691 digits.
%C A217377 a(1247) and a(1898) are currently unknown. If they are positive then a(1247)>86500 and a(1898)>58000.
