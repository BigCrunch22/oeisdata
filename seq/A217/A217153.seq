%N A217153 Number of nontrivially compound perfect squared rectangles of order n up to symmetries of the rectangle.
%C A217153 A squared rectangle (which may be a square) is a rectangle dissected into a finite number, two or more, of squares. If no two of these squares have the same size the squared rectangle is perfect. The order of a squared rectangle is the number of constituent squares.
%C A217153 A squared rectangle is simple if it does not contain a smaller squared rectangle, compound if it does, and trivially compound if a constituent square has the same side length as a side of the squared rectangle under consideration.

[Number of compound rectangles includes any that comprises a square sandwiched between two rectangles (from order 19) and excludes squares in separate column (order 24).]
