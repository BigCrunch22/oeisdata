%N A217302 Minimal natural number (in decimal representation) with n prime substrings in binary representation (substrings with leading zeros are considered to be nonprime).
%C A217302 The sequence is well-defined in that for each n the set of numbers with n prime substrings in binary representation is not empty. Proof: A000975(n+1) has exactly n prime substrings in binary representation (see A000975).
%C A217302 All terms with n > 1 are odd.
%H A217302 Hieronymus Fischer, <a href="/A217302/b217302.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..300</a>
%F A217302 a(n) >= 2^ceiling(sqrt(8*n+1)-1)/2).
%F A217302 a(n) <= A000975(n+1).
%F A217302 a(n+1) <= 2*a(n)+1.
%e A217302 a(1) = 2 = 10_2, since 2 is the least number with 1 prime substring (=10_2) in binary representation.
%e A217302 a(2) = 5 = 101_2, since 5 is the least number with 2 prime substrings in binary representation (10_2 and 101_2).
%e A217302 a(4) = 11 = 1011_2, since 11 is the least number with 4 prime substrings in binary representation (10_2, 11_2, 101_2 and 1011_2).
%e A217302 a(8) = 31 = 11111_2, since 31 is the least number with 8 prime substrings in binary representation (4 times 11_2, 3 times 111_2, and 11111_2).
%e A217302 a(9) = 47 = 101111_2, since 47 is the least number with 9 prime substrings in binary representation (10_2, 3 times 11_2, 101_2, 2 times 111_2, 1011_2, and 10111_2).
