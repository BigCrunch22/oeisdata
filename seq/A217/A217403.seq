%N A217403 a(n) is the smallest possible largest prime factor of the difference of two prime numbers q > p such that p + q = 2n.
%C A217403 Test up to n=1000000 shows that,
%C A217403 when n is odd, a(n)<=prime(m+3) such that m is the number of prime factors of n that are smaller or equal to prime(m+3);
%C A217403 when n is even, a(n)<=prime(m+4) such that m is the number of prime factors of n that are smaller or equal to prime(m+4).
%C A217403 This is hypothesized true for all n >= 4.
%C A217403 The first appearance of prime(k) in this sequence is A217016.

%e A217403 For n<4, there is not a pair of different prime numbers such that p+q=2n.
%e A217403 When n=4, we have p=3 and q=5 such that 3+5=2n=8 (the only case).  The largest prime factor of q-p=2 is 2, so a(4)=2;
%e A217403 ...
%e A217403 When n=90, we have prime number pairs (7,173) (13,167), (17,163), (23,157), (29,151), (31,149), (41,139), (43,137), (53,127), (67,113), (71,109), (73,107), (79,101), (83,97), totalled 14 pairs such that p1+p2=2n=180.  The difference of each pairs are 173-7=166=2*83, 163-17=154=2*7*11, 163-17=146=2*73, 157-23=134=2*67, 151-29=122=2*61, 149-31=118=2*59, 139-41=98=2*7^2, 137-43=94=2*47, 127-53=74=2*37, 113-67=46=2*23, 109-71=38=2*19, 107-73=34=2*17, 101-79=22=2*11, and 97-83=14=2*7 respectively.  Among these prime factorizations, the largest prime factors for each pairs are, 83, 11, 73, 67, 61, 59, 7, 47, 37, 23, 19, 17, 11, and 7 respectively.  In the fourteen prime numbers, the smallest one is 7.  So a(90)=7.
%e A217403 Additionally, 90=2*3^2*5, prime(3)=5, a(90)=7<prime(3+4)=17, consistent with the hypothesis.
