%N A217110 Number of pandigital numbers with n places.
%C A217110 The number of numbers between 10^(n-1) and 10^n which contain all decimal digits 0..9.
%C A217110 The ratio a(n)/(10^n-10^(n-1)) indicates the relative proportion of pandigital numbers with n places compared to all numbers with n places. Since that ratio converges to the limit 1 for n->infinity this can be expressed for large numbers as follows (in a slightly popular manner): ‘Almost all numbers contain all decimal digits 0..9’.
%C A217110 Example: a(n)/(10^n-10^(n-1)) = 0.99973439517775... for n = 100; in this case 99.9734...% of all 100-digit numbers contain all digits 0..9. Conversely, only the tiny proportion of 0.00026560482224... (<0.03%) lacks one digit. That’s astonishing! Intuitively, this is not what one would expect. In fact, for smaller numbers (with which most people are faced normally) the relative portion of numbers which missing at least one digit is significantly larger. Of course, for n<10 the portion is 100%, and even for numbers with n = 10 or 20 places the relative proportion of numbers which contain not all digits 0..9 is 99.96371...% or 78.52626...%, respectively. The least number of places for which the pandigital numbers hold the majority is 27. Here, the proportion of numbers which contain not all digits is 48.03664...%. So one could bet that a randomly chosen number with >= 27 places contains all digits.

%F A217110 a(n) = 9*9!*S2(n,10), where the S2(n,10) are the Stirling numbers of the second kind (cf. triangle A008277).
%F A217110 Asymptotic behavior:
%F A217110 lim a(n)/10^n = 9/10, for n -> infinity.
%F A217110 G.f.: g(x) = 9*9!*x^10/(product_{j=1..10} (1-jx)).
%F A217110 E.g.f. g(x) = (9/10) * (e^x - 1)^10.
%e A217110 a(k) = 0, for k < 10 since there a no pandigital numbers with < 10 places, trivially.
%e A217110 a(10) = 9*9!, since the first digit can be in the range 1..9 and for the following 9 digits there are 9, 8, 7, ..., 1 possible values.
%Y A217110 A171102, A050278, A011540, A002542, A053283, A217094.
