%N A217584 Numbers k such that d(k^2)/d(k) is an integer, where d(k) is the number of divisors of k.
%C A217584 The ratio d(k^2)/d(k) is: 1 for the number 1, 3 for numbers of the form p^4*q^2, 5 for numbers of the form p^4*q^2*r^2 (p, q, r being different primes).
%C A217584 Primes can't be in the sequence. A prime p has two divisors, while p^2 has three divisors: 1, p, p^2. - _Alonso del Arte_, Oct 07 2012
%C A217584 All the terms are squares since d(m) is odd if and only if m is a square, so d(k^2) is odd and since d(k)|d(k^2), d(k) is also odd, so k is a square. The ratio d(k^2)/d(k) can take values other than 1, 3, and 5: 1587600 is the least term with a ratio 9, and 192099600 is the least term with a ratio 15. - _Amiram Eldar_, May 23 2020
%C A217584 From _Bernard Schott_, May 29 2020 and Nov 22 2020: (Start)
%C A217584 This sequence comes from the 3rd problem, proposed by Belarus, during the 39th International Mathematical Olympiad in 1998 at Taipei (Taiwan) [see the link IMO].
%C A217584 If the prime signature of k is (u_1, u_2, ... , u_q) then d(k^2)/d(k) = Product_{i=1..q} (2*u_i+1)/(u_i+1). Two results:
%C A217584 1) If k is a term such that d(k^2)/d(k) = m, then all numbers that have the same prime signature of k are also terms and give the same ratio (see examples below).
%C A217584 2) The set of the integer values of the ratio d(k^2)/d(k) is exactly the set of all positive odd integers (see Marcin E. Kuczma reference).
%C A217584 Some examples:
%C A217584 For numbers with prime signature = (4, 2) (A189988), the ratio is 3 and the smallest such integer is 144 = 2^4 * 3^2.
%C A217584 For numbers with prime signature = (4, 2, 2) (A179746), the ratio is 5 and the smallest such integer is 3600 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5^2.
%C A217584 For numbers with prime signature = (4, 4, 2, 2) the ratio is 9 and the smallest such integer is 1587600 = 2^4 * 3^4 * 5^2 * 7^2.
%C A217584 For numbers with prime signature = (8, 4, 4, 2, 2) the ratio is 17 and the smallest such integer is 76839840000 = 2^8 * 3^4 * 5^4 * 7^2 * 11^2 (found by _David A. Corneth_ with other prime signatures). (End)

%e A217584 d(1^2)/d(1) = d(1)/d(1) = 1 an integer, so 1 belongs to the sequence.
%e A217584 144^2 has 45 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, ..., 20736, while 144 has 15 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, ..., 144; 45/15 = 3 and so 144 is in the sequence.
