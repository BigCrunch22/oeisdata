%N A217252 Lucky numbers whose digital reversal is another lucky number.
%C A217252 Inspired by the error in A140291 (forgotten palindromes 33 and 99), pointed out by _L. Edson Jeffery_ in a post to the SeqFan list.
%C A217252 This sequence is obtained from A118561 by removal of the palindromes A031161 = (1, 3, 7, 9, 33, 99, 111, 141, 151, 171, 303, 393, 535, 717, 727, 777, 787, 979, ...)
%C A217252 By analogy with the "emirps" A006567 and "emirpimes" A097393, these might be called "ykcul"s, for lucky numbers which, when reversed, are different lucky numbers.
