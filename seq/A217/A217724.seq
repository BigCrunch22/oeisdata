%N A217724 Smallest prime producing a gap with the next prime, the size of the gap being a composite number with 2n+1 as a factor.
%C A217724 The "gap" is defined as the number of integers between two primes.  If the two primes are p1 and p2, then the size of the gap is p2-p1-1.
%C A217724 For at least n<=100, the gap is minimal and is 3*(2n+1).

%e A217724 For n=2, the required gap is a composite number with 5 (2n+1) as a factor.  The size of all gaps are odd, so gaps of 15, 25, 35, etc. are required.  The prime 1831 and its next prime of 1847 produces a gap of 15.  1831 is the smallest prime with this property.
