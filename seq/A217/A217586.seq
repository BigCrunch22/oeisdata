%N A217586 a(1) = 1 and, for all n >= 1, if a(n) = 0 then a(2*n) = 1 and a(2*n+1) = 0 whereas if a(n) = 1 then a(2*n) = 0 and a(2*n+1) = 0.
%C A217586 The indices where 1 occurs in {a(n)} are {1, 4, 6, 10, 14, 16, ...} which appear to correspond precisely to the terms of A171945. (That is, if true, then this would be a characteristic function of A171945.) If this were proved then A171945 could be easily extended.

%F A217586 Conjecture: a(n) = (1 - (1 - 2*A096268(n-1))*(1 - 2*A036987(n-1)))/2. - _Velin Yanev_, Aug 08 2017
%F A217586 From _Michel Dekking_, Apr 19 2019: (Start):
%F A217586 Here is a proof of Velin Yanev's conjecture.
%F A217586 There is an offset problem. We will give the period-doubling sequence offset 1, and will also consider the characteristic function of powers of 2, A209229, instead of the Fredholm-Rueppel sequence A036987.
%F A217586 Let alpha be the period doubling morphism
%F A217586     alpha:  0 -> 01, 1 -> 00.
%F A217586 Let PD = 01000101... be the fixed point of alpha, with offset 1, so PD(n+1) = A096268(n).
%F A217586 Let beta be the time reversal of alpha
%F A217586     beta:  0 -> 10,  1 -> 00.
%F A217586 By definition, (a(n)) satisfies (a(n)) = 1 beta((a(n))), implying that
%F A217586 (*)    (a(n)) = 1 beta(1) beta^2(1) beta^3(1) ....
%F A217586 Note that Yanev's conjecture can be reformulated as
%F A217586             /  PD(n)   if n is not a power of 2,
%F A217586    a(n) = -|
%F A217586             \  1-PD(n)  if n is a power of 2.
%F A217586 It is easy to see that for all n
%F A217586     beta^n(0) = beta^n(1), EXCEPT for the first letter:
%F A217586 beta^n(0) = delta(n)R, beta^n(1) = (1-delta(n))R, where
%F A217586     delta(2n) = 0, delta(2n+1) = 1.
%F A217586 We will use below that, similarly, alpha^n(0) = alpha^n(1), EXCEPT for the LAST letter.
%F A217586 From (*) we see now that the conjecture will be proved if one shows that
%F A217586 (**)   alpha^n(0) = 0 beta(0)beta^2(0)...beta^{n-1}(0) delta(n),
%F A217586 since the first letters of the beta^(k) in this concatenation occur exactly at positions 2^k.
%F A217586 The formula (**) has a companion
%F A217586 (***)   beta^n(0) = delta(n) 0 beta(0)beta^2(0)...beta^{n-1}(0).
%F A217586 We will prove both formula's together with induction on n.
%F A217586 For n=2 (**) and (***) one has to check
%F A217586 alpha^2(0)=0beta(0)delta(2)=0100, beta^2(0)=delta(2)0beta(0)=0010,
%F A217586 which are true.  Suppose (**), (***) hold for some n>1. Then
%F A217586     alpha^{n+1}(0) = alpha^n(0) alpha^n(1) =
%F A217586     0 beta(0)beta^2(0)...beta^{n-1}(0) delta(n)0
%F A217586          beta(0)beta^2(0)...beta^{n-1}(0) (1-delta(n)) =
%F A217586     0 beta(0)beta^2(0)...beta^n(0) (1-delta(n)) =
%F A217586     0 beta(0)beta^2(0)...beta^n(0)delta(n+1).
%F A217586 The formula for (***) with n+1 follows in a similar way.
