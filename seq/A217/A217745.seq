%N A217745 Number of regions in the exterior of a regular n-gon with all diagonals drawn.
%e A217745 a(3) = 1 since the equilateral triangle has no diagonals and therefore one exterior region (with infinite area).
%e A217745 a(4) = 4 since the two diagonals of the square divide the exterior in four regions (with infinite area).
%e A217745 a(5) = 10 since the ten diagonals of the regular pentagon divide the exterior in ten regions (with infinite area) of two different shapes.
%Y A217745 Cf. A007678.
