%N A217106 Minimal number (in decimal representation) with n nonprime substrings in base-6 representation (substrings with leading zeros are considered to be nonprime).
%C A217106 The sequence is well-defined in that for each n the set of numbers with n nonprime substrings is not empty. Proof: Define m(n):=2*sum_{j=i..k} 6^j, where k:=floor((sqrt(8*n+1)-1)/2), i:= n-A000217(k). For n=0,1,2,3,... the m(n) in base-6 representation are 2, 22, 20, 222, 220, 200, 2222, 2220, 2200, 2000, 22222, 22220, .... m(n) has k+1 digits and (k-i+1) 2â€™s, thus, the number of nonprime substrings of m(n) is ((k+1)*(k+2)/2)-k-1+i = (k*(k+1)/2)+i = n, which proves the statement.
%C A217106 If p is a number with k prime substrings and d digits (in base-6 representation), m>=d, than b := p*6^(m-d) has m*(m+1)/2 - k nonprime substrings, and a(A000217(n)-k) <= b.

%F A217106 a(n) >= 6^floor((sqrt(8*n-7)-1)/2) for n>0, equality holds if n is a triangular number (cf. A000217).
%F A217106 a(A000217(n)) = 6^(n-1), n>0.
%F A217106 a(A000217(n)-k) >= 6^(n-1) + k, 0<=k<n, n>0.
%F A217106 a(A000217(n)-k) = 6^(n-1) + p, where p is the minimal number >= 0 such that 6^(n-1) + p, has k prime substrings in base-6 representation, 0<=k<n, n>0.
%e A217106 a(0) = 2, since 2 = 2_6 is the least number with zero nonprime substrings in base-6 representation.
%e A217106 a(1) = 1, since 1 = 1_6 is the least number with 1 nonprime substring in base-6 representation.
%e A217106 a(2) = 7, since 7 = 11_6 is the least number with 2 nonprime substrings in base-6 representation (1 and 1).
%e A217106 a(3) = 6, since 6 = 10_6 is the least number with 3 nonprime substrings in base-6 representation (0, 1 and 10).
%e A217106 a(4) = 41, since 41 = 105_6 is the least number with 4 nonprime substrings in base-6 representation, these are 0, 1, 10, and 05 (remember, that substrings with leading zeros are considered to be nonprime).
