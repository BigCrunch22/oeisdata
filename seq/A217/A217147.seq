%N A217147 Prime numbers after which at least four distinct classes modulo 7 are equally represented among the primes to that point.
%C A217147 Only after 13 and 223 are five of the congruence classes modulo 7 equally represented, and it's not unreasonable to conjecture that this holds permanently.
%e A217147 At the 31st term, 1404351607, 11698330 primes have occurred congruent to each of 1, 2, 3 and 4 modulo 7.
