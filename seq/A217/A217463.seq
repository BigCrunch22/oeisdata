%N A217463 a(n) is the sum of total number of positive integer solutions to each of a^2 + b^2 = n, a^2 + 2*b^2 = n, a^2 + 3*b^2 = n and a^2 + 7*b^2 = n. (Order does not matter for the equation a^2+b^2 = n).
%C A217463 Note: For the equation a^2 + b^2 = n, if there are two solutions (a,b) and (b,a), then they will be counted only once.
%C A217463 The sequences A216501 and A216671 give how many of the four k values, k = 1, 2, 3, 7 does the equation a^2 + k*b^2 = n have a solution to.
%C A217463 1, 2, 3, 7 are the first four numbers, with the class number 1.
%C A217463 "If a composite number C is of the form a^2 + kb^2 for some integers a & b, then every prime factor of C raised to an odd power is of the form c^2 + kd^2 for some integers c & d."
%C A217463 This statement is only true for k = 1, 2, 3.
%C A217463 For k = 7, with the exception of the prime factor 2, the statement mentioned above is true.
%C A217463 A number can be written as a^2 + b^2 if and only if it has no prime factor congruent to 3 (mod 4) raised to an odd power.
%C A217463 A number can be written as a^2 + 2b^2 if and only if it has no prime factor congruent to 5 (mod 8) or 7 (mod 8) raised to an odd power.
%C A217463 A number can be written as a^2 + 3b^2 if and only if it has no prime factor congruent to 2 (mod 3) raised to an odd power.
%C A217463 A number can be written as a^2 + 7b^2 if and only if it has no prime factor congruent to 3 (mod 7) or 5 (mod 7) or 6 (mod 7) raised to an odd power, and the exponent of 2 is not 1.
