%N A217760 Cumulative counting sequence: (adjective-before-noun) pairs with first term 0; see Comments.
%C A217760 Write 0 followed by segments defined inductively as follows: each segment
%C A217760 tells how many times each previously written integer occurs, in the order
%C A217760 of first occurrence.  This is Method A (adjective-before-noun pairs); for
%C A217760 Method B (noun-before-adjective), see A055168.  The sequence A217760 was
%C A217760 originally A055186 (Apr 27 2000); the present A055186 has a shorter
%C A217760 definition and differs from A217760 beginning at the 62nd term.
