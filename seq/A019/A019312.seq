%N A019312 Taxman sequence: define T(S) by max{x+T(S \ {c : c|x})}, where the max is over all x in S for which S also contains a proper divisor of x; if no such x exists, T(S)=0; set T(n)=T({1,...,n}).
%C A019312 In Germany this is called the Number Shark (Zahlenhai) sequence: see the CrypTool link.
%C A019312 This sequence is associated with the taxman game. The open source cryptography e-learning program JCrypTool (JCT) includes a tutorial and a discussion about strategies for the taxman game. - _Bernhard Esslinger_, Mar 17 2015, Sep 17 2019 and May 04 2020
%C A019312 In order for a player to select a number in the game, at least one of the number's maximal factors must be available to be claimed by the taxman. - _Brian Chess_, Sep 24 2022

%F A019312 When you take a number from S, you must give all its proper divisors to the tax man and there must be at least one to give; T(S) is the maximum total income.
