%N A019337 Primes with primitive root 7.
%C A019337 To allow primes less than the specified primitive root m (here, 7) to be included, we use the essentially equivalent definition "Primes p such that the multiplicative order of m mod p is p-1". This comment applies to all of A019334-A019421. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 03 2019
%C A019337 All terms apart from the first are == 5, 11, 13, 15, 17, 23 (mod 28) since 7 is a quadratic residue modulo any other prime. By Artin's conjecture, this sequence contains about 37.395% of all primes, that is, about 74.79% of all primes == 5, 11, 13, 15, 17, 23 (mod 28). - _Jianing Song_, Sep 05 2018
