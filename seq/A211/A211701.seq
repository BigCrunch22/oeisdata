%N A211701 Rectangular array by antidiagonals, n >= 1, k >= 1: R(n,k) = n + [n/2] + ... + [n/k], where [ ]=floor.
%C A211701 R(n,k) is the number of ordered pairs (x,y) of integers x,y satisfying 1 <= x <= k, 1 <= y <= k, and x*y <= n.

%C A211701 For n > =1, row n is a homogeneous linear recurrence sequence of order A005728(n), and it exemplifies a certain class, C, of recurrences which are palindromic (in the sense given below). The class depends on sequences s having n-th term [(n^k)/j], where k and j are arbitrary fixed positive integers and [ ] = floor. The characteristic polynomial of s is (x^j-1)(x-1)^k, which is a palindromic polynomial (sometimes called a reciprocal polynomial). The class C consists of sequences u given by the form
%C A211701    ...
%C A211701    u(n) = c(1)*[r(1)*n^k(1)] + ... + c(m)*[r(m)*n^k(m)],
%C A211701    ...
%C A211701 where c(i) are integers and r(i) are rational numbers. Assume that r(i) is in lowest terms, and let j(i) be its denominator. Then the characteristic polynomial of u is the least common multiple of all the irreducible (over the integers) factors of all the polynomials (x^j(i)-1)(x-1)^k(i). As all such factors are palindromic (indeed, they are all cyclotomic polynomials), the characteristic polynomial of u is also palindromic. In other words, if the generating function of u is written as p(x)/q(x), then q(x) is a palindromic polynomial.
%C A211701 Thus, if q(x) = q(h)x^h + ... + q(1)x + q(0),
%C A211701 then (q(h), q(h-1), ..., q(1), q(0)) is palindromic, and consequently, the recurrence coefficients for u, after excluding q(0); i.e., (- q(h-1), ... - q(1)), are palindromic. For example, row 3 of A211701 has the following recurrence: u(n) = u(n-2) + u(n-3) - u(n-5), for which q(x) = x^5 - x^3 - x^2 + 1, with recurrence coefficients (0,1,1,0,-1).
