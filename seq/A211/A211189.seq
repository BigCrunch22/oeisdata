%N A211189 Number of prime divisors formed by {2} and the consecutive Pythagorean primes for all the composites k^2 + 1 between the two primes A002496(n) and A002496(n+1).
%C A211189 a(1)=0; for n > 1, a(n) = number of consecutive elements of the form {2, A002144(1), A002144(2), ...} of each row in A211175(n).
%C A211189 The immediate objective of this sequence is to show that it is difficult to obtain a large range of consecutive Pythagorean primes from the decomposition of n^2 + 1, because the growth of a(n) is very slow, for example a(351) = 29, a(22215) = 34, ...
%C A211189 These considerations confirm the opinion of the truthfulness of the conjecture about an infinity of primes of the form n^2 + 1. This sequence gives the length of a variety of conjecturally infinite subsequences of consecutive primes starting with {2, 5, ...}. If the number of primes of the form n^2 + 1 were finite, there should exist a last prime p such that this sequence stops abruptly from p because the length of A002144(n) is infinite. In this case, we should observe a contradictory behavior of this sequence between the stability of the slow growth of a(n) and the discontinuity from the prime p. But this case is highly improbable.

%e A211189 a(8) = 4 because the set formed by the union of the prime divisors of all the numbers k^2+1 between the primes A002496(8) = 401 and A002496(9) = 577 are {2, 5, 13, 17, 53, 97} and the subset {2} union {5, 13, 17} contains 4 consecutive elements, hence 4 is in the sequence.
