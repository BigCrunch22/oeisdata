%N A211408 Numbers k such that the number of letters, excluding spaces and hyphens, in the English names of k and its reversal are the same.
%C A211408 All base-10 palindromes occur in this sequence.
%H A211408 Robert G. Wilson v, <a href="/A211408/b211408.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..23885</a>
%F A211408 {n such that A005589(n) = A005589(A004086(n))}.
%e A211408 10 is in the sequence because "ten" has three letters, and so does "one" which is the name of the digital reverse of 10, which is 1 (because the leading 0 is truncated in 01).
%e A211408 14 is in the sequence because "fourteen" and "fortyone" both have 8 letters.
