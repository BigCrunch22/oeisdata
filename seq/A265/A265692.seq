%N A265692 Irregular triangle read by rows: lexicographically last addition chain of minimal length for n.
%C A265692 While addition chains are normally entered with terms in increasing order, the usual definition requires only that each term follows a pair of terms of which it is the sum. This sequence will eventually contain rows that are not monotonic; in particular, any non-Brauer number will have such a chain. What is the first number whose chain in this sequence is not monotonic?
%C A265692 47 is the first number with a non-monotonic lexicographically last addition chain of minimal length: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 5, 21, 42, 47]. - _Alois P. Heinz_, Dec 22 2015
