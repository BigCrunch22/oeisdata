%N A265920 Numerator of the probability that Alice wins the following game: Alice and Bob take turn (Alice starts first) to gain 1 or 2 chips randomly and independently with 1/2 chance, and the first player that collects at least n chips is the winner.
%C A265920 The formula is proved by _Wing Hong Tony Wong_ and _Jiao Xu_, and then proved by Taoye Zhang and Ju Zhou independently.
%C A265920 The probability that Alice wins the game is a(n)/4^(n-1).
%F A265920 a(n) = (4^n + Sum_(k=1..n) 4^(n-k)*(binomial(k, n-k)+binomial(k-1, n-k))^2)/8.
%t A265920 Table[(4^n + Sum[4^(n - k)*(Binomial[k, n - k] + Binomial[k - 1, n - k])^2, {k, n}])/8, {n, 100}]
%Y A265920 A265919 provides the integer sequence of the numerator of the probability that Bob wins the game. The corresponding terms of these two sequences add up to 4^n.
%K A265920 nonn
%O A265920 1,2
