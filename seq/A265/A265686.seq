%N A265686 Number of shapes of grid-filling curves of order 6*n+1 (on the tri-hexagonal grid) with turns by +-60 and +-120 degrees that are generated by Lindenmayer-systems with just one symbol apart from the turns.
%C A265686 Such curves exist only for n such that 6*n+1 is a term of A003136, these values 6*n+1 are given in A260682.
%C A265686 The first such curve, the only one of order 7, was discovered by Jeffrey Ventrella, see page 105 in the Ventrella reference.
