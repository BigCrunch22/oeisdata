%N A265843 Number of moves for the prime winding graph to have a zero x coordinate value.
%C A265843 Define the prime winding graph as follows: Starting at (0,0) draw a straight line up the y-axis until the first prime is attained. Once the first prime is attained draw a straight line 90 degrees to the left until the second prime is attained. When the second prime is attained draw a straight line 90 degrees to the left until the third prime is attained. Repeat this process for all primes up to a specified number. The above sequence represents the number of moves required for the x coordinate to be equal to zero, where one move is equal to a line of length 1.
