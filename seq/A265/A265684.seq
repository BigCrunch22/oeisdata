%N A265684 Sarrus numbers (A001567) that are the average of two consecutive primes.
%C A265684 Inspired by A265669.
%C A265684 Motivation was the form of differences between consecutive primes that generate this sequence. It seems that 12*k appears in differences most of the time. For the first 175 term of this sequence, the relevant proportion is 161/175.
%C A265684 Differences between corresponding consecutive primes are 4, 12, 12, 36, 4, 12, 12, 36, 4, 4, 24, 24, 4, 60, 24, 24, 24, 12, 12, 36, 12, 24, 12, 24, 36, 12, 12, 12, 12, 24, 4, 60, 24, 48, 36, 12, 24, 36, 24, 20, 12, 84, 36, 12, 24, 24, 12, 24, 36, 12, 12, 36, ...
