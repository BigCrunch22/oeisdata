%N A113969 The first illegal prime number (the 1401 digits of its decimal expansion).
%C A113969 The first illegal prime number was generated on March 2001 by Phil Carmody. Its binary representation corresponds to a compressed version of the C source code of a computer program implementing the DeCSS decryption scheme, making any DVD copy readable with any DVD player. Interpreted in this particular way, this number describes a computer program which bypasses copyright protection schemes on some DVDs. Such programs are illegal to possess or distribute under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Of course, any prime number is not illegal, although such an interpretation of it could be. It's fully displayed in the Wiki link below. Phil Carmody generated also other illegal primes; one of them (1811 digits) represents a non-compressed executable that performs the same task as this compressed program (cf. A113970).
