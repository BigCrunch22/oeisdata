%N A113970 The first illegal executable prime number (the 1811 digits of its decimal expansion).
%C A113970 The first illegal prime number (1401 digits, cf. A113969) was generated on March 2001 by Phil Carmody. Its binary representation corresponds to the compressed version of the C source code of a computer program implementing the DeCSS decryption scheme, making any DVD copy readable with any DVD player. This prime number here (1811 digits) represents a *non-compressed executable* that performs the same task as the compressed program. Interpreted in this particular way, this number describes a computer program which bypasses copyright protection schemes on some DVDs. Such programs are illegal to possess or distribute under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Of course, any prime number is not illegal, although such an interpretation of it could be. It's fully displayed in the Wiki link below.
