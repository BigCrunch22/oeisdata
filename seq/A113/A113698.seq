%N A113698 Combinatorial sequence. Begin with 1 then 2 then 12 then 3 then all concatenations of all sizes of 1,2 and 3, then 4, then all concatenations of all sizes of 1,2,3,4 not included earlier etc.
%C A113698 The index of n is 2^n for n<10. After 9 if n ( like 13, 23) has appeared earlier it will not appear but it will be used in the concatenation at its turn as mentioned above. needs better description.
%C A113698 The sequence contains groups of integers generated from seeds s=1,2,3,4,... A group is the sorted list of numbers defined by the seed and all concatenations of integers of previous groups with the seed, discarding any duplicates. - _R. J. Mathar_, Aug 31 2007

%e A113698 The group 4, 14, 24, 34, 124, 134, 234, 1234 is generated from the seed s=4 itself and attaching s=4 to the previous elements 1, 2, 12, 3, 13, 23, 123, that is 14, 24, 124, 34, 134, 234, 1234, then sorting within the group (moving 34 between 24 and 124).
