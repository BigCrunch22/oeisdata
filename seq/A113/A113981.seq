%N A113981 a(1)=1. a(n) is smallest positive integer that does not occur earlier in the sequence and is such that d(a(n)) does not equal d(a(n-1)), where d(n) is the number of positive divisors of n.
%C A113981 Sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A113981 Since d(a(4)) = d(3) = 2, d(a(5)) cannot be 2. a(5)= 6 is the smallest positive integer not occurring earlier in the sequence where d(a(5)) is not 2, since d(6) = 4.
