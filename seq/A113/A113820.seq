%N A113820 Triangle where the n terms of row n are the smallest positive integers not occurring earlier in the sequence such that, for any given m (1<=m<=n), a(n,m) and n do not have any 1-bits in the same position when they are written in binary.
%C A113820 Sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A113820 Among first 2001000 terms (2000 rows) this permutation has fixed points 38, 195, 62107 and 1286571, 2-cycle (1,2) and 3-cycles (11603,13126,13397) and (176377,187821,298266).

%e A113820 4 = 100 in binary. Among the positive integers not occurring among the first 3 rows of the sequence (3 = 11 in binary, 5 = 101 in binary, 7 = 111 in binary, etc...), [3,9,10,11] (which is [11,1001,1010,1011] in binary) are the lowest 4 positive integers that do not share any 1-bits with 4 when written in binary. So row 4 is [3,9,10,11].
