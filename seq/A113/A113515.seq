%N A113515 If the name of the n-th Pope is Pope XXX the k-th, then the n-th term is k.
%C A113515 The apparent inconsistency that a(n) has its second "3" before its second "2" is due to the ambiguous nomenclature of Pope(48) = "St. Felix III (II)" [A.D. 483-492], Pope(54) = "St. Felix IV (III)" [A.D. 526-530], et cetera, as well as Pope(77) = "Adeodatus (II)" [A.D. 672-676]. Pope(140) = "Sylvester II" [999-1003], also known as Gerbert, was the greatest mathematician among all popes [see D.E. Smith]. Note also that the generally superb Catholic Encyclopedia differs with independent sources on matters such as periods of time with no pope and periods with two or even three simultaneous popes. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Jan 14 2006
