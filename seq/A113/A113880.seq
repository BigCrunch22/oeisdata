%N A113880 Variation on Recamán's sequence utilizing the four basic operations (/,-,+,*) in that order.
%C A113880 More precisely:
%C A113880 a(n) = a(n-1)/n if a(n-1)/n is integer and not already in the sequence. Else:
%C A113880 a(n) = a(n-1)-n if a(n-1)-n is positive and not already in the sequence. Else:
%C A113880 a(n) = a(n-1)+n if a(n-1)+n is not already in the sequence. Else:
%C A113880 a(n) = a(n-1)*n if a(n-1)*n is not already in the sequence. Else STOP.
%C A113880 In other words, divide if you can, else subtract, else add, else multiply.
%C A113880 By a(1000) there are 3 division steps, 928 subtraction steps, 59 addition steps and 10 multiplication steps. It is unlikely that every number belongs to the sequence since there are many "holes". It is an open question if there are any repetitions after a multiplication step. Can anybody expand the series?
%C A113880 At a(2500000000)=2285684529311288243, there have been 44 divisions, 2499821613 subtractions, 178253 additions, and 90 multiplications. The largest value seen was a[1926305697]=3555357710450807490. No multiplication step has produced a duplicate term. - _Benjamin Chaffin_, Sep 22 2016

%e A113880 a(24) = 432 because: a(23) = 18.
%e A113880 18/24 is not an integer.
%e A113880 18-24 is negative.
%e A113880 18 + 24 = 42 is already in the sequence.
%e A113880 Therefore 18 * 24 = 432.
