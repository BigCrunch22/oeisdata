%N A113543 Numbers both squarefree and triangle-free.
%C A113543 The cardinality (count, enumeration) of these through n equals n - card{squarefree numbers <= n} - card{trianglefree numbers <= n} + card{numbers <= n which are both square and triangular} = n - card{numbers <= n in A005117} - card{numbers <=n in A112886} + card{numbers <= n in A001110}. "There is no known polynomial time algorithm for recognizing squarefree integers or for computing the squarefree part of an integer. In fact, this problem may be no easier than the general problem of integer factorization (obviously, if an integer can be factored completely, is squarefree iff it contains no duplicated factors). This problem is an important unsolved problem in number theory" [Weisstein]. Conjecture: there is no polynomial time algorithm for recognizing numbers which are both squarefree and triangle-free.
