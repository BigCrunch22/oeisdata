%N A113945 Numbers n such that the smallest possible number of multiplications required to compute x^n is by 1 less than the number of multiplications obtained by Knuth's power tree method.
%C A113945 The first three terms are given in Knuth's TAOCP, Vol. 2. The sequence is based on a table of shortest addition chain lengths computed by _Neill M. Clift_, see link to _Achim Flammenkamp_'s web page given at A003313.

%e A113945 a(1)=77 because the power tree construction produces the chain 1 2 3 5 7 14 19 38 76 77 requiring 9 additions, whereas there are 4 shortest chains that come along with 8 additions, e.g. 1 2 4 8 9 17 34 43 77.
