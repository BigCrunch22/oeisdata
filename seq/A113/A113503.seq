%N A113503 a(1) = 1. For n >= 2, a(n) is the number of earlier terms of the sequence that have the same number of ones in their binary representations as n.
%H A113503 Michael De Vlieger, <a href="/A113503/b113503.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..16384</a> (First 210 terms from Diana L. Mecum).
%e A113503 The first 7 terms written in binary are [1,1,0,10,0,0,0]. The 8th term gives the number of earlier terms with the same number of 1's in their binary representation as 8 (which is 1000 in binary, for one 1). a(8) = 3 because there are three terms among the first 7 terms with one binary 1 (terms with one 1: 1, 1 and 2).
