%N A113599 Least n-digit multiple of n whose digit permutations yield at least n distinct multiples of n, or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A113599 Conjecture: No term is zero. The proof should be simple.
%C A113599 There are no zeros for n<=500. - _Sean A. Irvine_, Apr 10 2013
%C A113599 The conjecture is true: There are 9*10^(n-1) n-digit numbers, meaning at least floor(9*10^(n-1)/n) n-digit multiples of n. There are binomial(n+9, 9) multisets of n digits. Thus, by the pigeonhole principle, one of these multisets contains at least ceiling(floor(9*10^(n-1)/n)/binomial(n+9, 9)) multiples of n, and this number is at least n whenever n > 3. - _James Rayman_, Feb 14 2023
%e A113599 a(4) = 1004; the multiples of 4 arising as a digit permutation are 1004, 1040, 1400, 4100.
