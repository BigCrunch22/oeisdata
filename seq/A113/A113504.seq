%e A113504 The first 8 terms (terms 0 through 7) written in binary are [1,1,10,0,11,1,1,0]. Term 8 gives the number of earlier terms with the same number of 1's in their binary representation as 8 (which is 1000 in binary, for one 1). a(8) = 5 because there are five terms among the earlier terms with one binary 1 (terms with one 1: 1, 1, 2, 1 and 1).
