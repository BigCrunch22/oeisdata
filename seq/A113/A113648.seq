%N A113648 A variant of Josephus Problem in which 2 persons are to be eliminated at the same time.
%C A113648 a(n) is defined as follows. Write the numbers 1 through 2n in a circle, start at 1 and n+1. Cross off every other number until only one number is left. The process that starts with 1 should be the first at any stage. For example we cross off 2, n+2, 4, n+4, 6, n+6, .... The remaining number is a(n). This function is defined only for even arguments.

%F A113648 The sequence a(m) is defined for any even number m as follows: a(2) = 1. a(4*n) = 2*a(2*n) - 2*n - 1 (if a(2*n) > n) and a(4*n) = 2*a(2*n) + 2*n - 1 (if a(2*n) <= n). a(4*n+2) = 2*a(2*n+2) - 2*n - 5 (if a(2*n+2) >= n + 3), a(4*n+2) = 2*a(2*n+2) + 2*n - 2 (if n + 3 > a(2*n+2) >= 2), and a(4*n+2) = 2*n+1 (if a(2*n+2) = 1).
%e A113648 For a(8): we are to cross off 2, 6, 4, 8, 7, 3, 5 and 1 is left. Therefore a(8) = 1.
