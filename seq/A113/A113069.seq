%N A113069 Number of highly composite numbers between two consecutive superior highly composite numbers.
%C A113069 The SHC numbers are a subset of the HC numbers. Is there a formula for a(n) that depends on the two consecutive SHC numbers A002201(n) and A002201(n+1)?

%H A113069 Achim Flammenkamp, <a href="http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/achim/highly.html">Highly Composite Numbers</a>.
%e A113069 Example: a(3)=3 because between the SHC numbers 12 and 60 there are three HC numbers: 24, 36 and 48.
%Y A113069 Cf. A002182 (highly composite numbers), A002201 (superior highly composite numbers).
