%N A113517 Least k such that k^n-k+1 is prime, or 0 if there is no such k.
%C A113517 a(n) is 0 for n=8,14,20,... (n=2 mod 6) because, for those n, the polynomial x^n-x+1 has the factor x^2-x+1. Using a result of Selmer, it can be shown that x^n-x+1 is irreducible for all other n. Does a(n) exist for all n>1?
