%N A113529 Opus numbers skipped over by Carl Nielsen.
%C A113529 Because Carl Nielsen did not carefully keep track of his musical compositions and was published by different houses, he often guessed when a publisher asked for an opus number for a given piece. This resulted in his skipping over the numbers listed in Simpson (1979). His last opus number is Opus 59, which is FS 131 in the scholarly catalog by Fog and Schousboe. The last number in the FS catalog is 161.
