%N A113730 A variant of Golomb's sequence interpreted as a triangle: Start with a(1)=1 as first row, filled from left to right; fill row n+1 with the natural numbers continuing from row n in alternating order, with multiplicity according to the numbers given in row n in alternating order.
%e A113730 The triangle begins
