%N A113722 A variant of Golomb's sequence using odd numbers: a(n) is the number of times 2*n+1 occurs, starting with a(1) = 1.
%C A113722 a(n) is taken to be the smallest number >= a(n-1) which is compatible with the description.
%e A113722 Start with 1 in row 1 and form a triangle where row n is generated from row n-1 by the rule given in the description. Then row 2 will have (1) 3, row 3 will have (3) 5's, row 4 will have (5) 7's, (5) 9's and (5) 11's, etc.
%e A113722 The triangle begins:
%e A113722 1;
%e A113722 3;
%e A113722 5,5,5;
%e A113722 7,7,7,7,7,9,9,9,9,9,11,11,11,11,11; ...
%e A113722 The number of terms in each row (also row sums with offset) is given by A113723: [1,1,3,15,135,3845,769605,3821696361,...].
