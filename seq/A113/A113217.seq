%N A113217 Parity of decimal digital root of n.
%C A113217 Except for the first element, the sequence is periodic (with a period of length 9).  The sequence corresponds to that produced by a prescribed set of bitwise operations.  The (sub)sequence is produced starting from input pairs (0,1),(1,1),(1,0).  For example, (0,1) acted on (in succession) by [and,xor,or,xor,or,and,or,and,xor], with the same operation set then repeated.  For clarity, the example is AND(0,1) is 0.  XOR(1,0) is 1.  OR(0,1) is 1.  XOR(1,1) is 0.  OR(1,0) is 1.  AND(0,1) is 0.  OR(1,0) is 1.  AND(0,1) is 0.  XOR(1,0) is 1.  Repeat.  The analysis was done using Gnumeric's built-in functions.  In this example, the inputs align to n=2,3, and the operation results to the next 7 elements.  The (3) starting input pairs mentioned begin at bitwise operator positions 1,2 and 5. - _Bill McEachen_, May 24 2014
