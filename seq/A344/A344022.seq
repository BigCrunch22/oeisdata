%N A344022 Numbers with binary expansion (b_1, ..., b_m) such that bending a strip of paper of length k+1 with an angle of +90 degrees (resp. -90 degrees) at position X=k when b_k = 1 (resp. b_k = 0) for k = 1..m yields a configuration where all edges are distinct.
%C A344022 All positive terms belong to A166535, but the reverse is not true (for example, A166535(96) = 136 does not belong to this sequence).
%C A344022 This sequence is infinite as it contains A000975 and A343183.
%C A344022 If m belongs to the sequence, then floor(m/2) also belongs to the sequence.
%C A344022 For any k > 0, the sequence contains A006744(k) positive terms with k binary digits.
%C A344022 This sequence has connections with A258002, A255561 and A255571: these sequences encode in binary nonoverlapping or noncrossing paths in the honeycomb lattice.
