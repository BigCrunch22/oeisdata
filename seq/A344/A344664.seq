%N A344664 a(n) is the number of preference profiles in the stable marriage problem with n men and n women where both the men's and the women's preferences form a Latin square when arranged in a matrix. In addition, it is possible to arrange all people into n man-woman couples such that they rank each other first.
%C A344664 Two people who rank each other first are called soulmates. Thus, the profiles in this sequence have n pairs of soulmates.
%C A344664 The profiles with n pairs of soulmates are counted by sequence A343698. The profiles such that the men's preferences form a Latin square are counted by A343696. The profiles such that both men's and women's preferences form a Latin square are counted by A343697. The profiles in this sequence are the intersection of profiles in A343698 and A343697.
%C A344664 Both the men- and the women-proposing Gale-Shapley algorithm on the preference profiles described by this sequence end in one round.

%F A344664 a(n) = A002860(n)^2 / n!.
%F A344664 a(n) = A000479(n) * A002860(n).
%e A344664 For n = 3, there are A002860(3) = 12 Latin squares of order 3. Thus, there are A002860(3) = 12 ways to set up the men's preference profiles. After that, the women's preference profiles form a Latin square with a fixed first column, as the first column is uniquely defined to generate 3 pairs of soulmates. Thus, there are A002860(3)/3! = 12/6 = 2 ways to set up the women's preference profiles, making a(3) = 12 * 2 = 24 preference profiles.
