%N A344494 Triangle read by rows: The d-th row contains the Betti numbers of the d-dimensional resonance arrangement.
%C A344494 a(d,i) is the i-th Betti number of the d-dimensional resonance arrangement (for 1 <= i <= d).
%C A344494 The d-dimensional resonance arrangement is the hyperplane arrangement in the d-dimensional space (x_1,...,x_d) consisting of (2^d - 1) hyperplanes c_1*x_1 + c_2*x_2 + ... + c_d*x_d = 0 where c_j are 0 or +1 and we exclude the case with all c=0. This arrangement is also called the all-subset arrangement.
%C A344494 The Betti numbers are also called Whitney numbers of the second kind and they are also the absolute values of the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the arrangement.
%C A344494 The sum of the Betti numbers equals the number of chambers of this arrangement.
%C A344494 The Betti numbers for the 8- and 9-dimensional resonance arrangement were computed with the julia package CountingChambers.jl.
