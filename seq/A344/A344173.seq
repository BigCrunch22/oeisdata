%N A344173 Number of primes p < prime(n) of the form x^3 + 2*y^3 with x nonnegative and y + 1 prime such that p is a quadratic nonresidue modulo prime(n).
%C A344173 In 2001 Heath-Brown proved that there are infinitely many primes of the form x^3 + 2*y^3 with x and y nonnegative integers.
%C A344173 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 1. In other words, for each odd prime p, there is a prime q < p of the form x^3 + 2*y^3 with x nonnegative and y + 1 prime such that q is a quadratic nonresidue modulo p.
%C A344173 (ii) For any prime p > 5 not equal to 29, there is a prime q < p of the form x^3 + 2*y^3 with x nonnegative and y + 1 prime such that q is a quadratic residue modulo p.
%C A344173 Part (i) of the conjecture verified for all odd primes p < 2*10^9.
%C A344173 We even conjecture further that for any prime p > 5 there is a prime q < p of the form x^3 + 2*y^3 with x nonnegative and y + 1 prime such that q is a primitive root modulo p.
%C A344173 See also A344174 for a similar conjecture.
