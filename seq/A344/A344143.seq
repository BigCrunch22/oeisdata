%N A344143 Indices k such that A344141(k) and A344142(k) are not equal.
%C A344143 A344141 and A344142 are two different methods of finding the "first irreducible GF(2)[X] polynomial of degree k". Sequence gives k such that this two methods disagree.
%C A344143 Obviously, k is a term if and only if A000120(A344141(k)) != A000120(A344142(k)).

%e A344143 33 is a term, since lexicographically the first irreducible GF(2)[X] polynomial of degree 33 is x^33 + x^6 + x^3 + x + 1, while lexicographically the first irreducible GF(2)[X] polynomial with the lowest possible number of terms is x^33 + x^10 + 1.
%e A344143 37 is a term, since lexicographically the first irreducible GF(2)[X] polynomial of degree 37 is x^37 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1, while lexicographically the first irreducible GF(2)[X] polynomial with the lowest possible number of terms is x^37 + x^6 + x^4 + x + 1.
%e A344143 54 is a term, since lexicographically the first irreducible GF(2)[X] polynomial of degree 54 is x^54 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + 1, while lexicographically the first irreducible GF(2)[X] polynomial with the lowest possible number of terms is x^54 + x^9 + 1.
