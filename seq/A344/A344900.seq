%N A344900 a(n) is the number of well-formed formulas (wffs) of zeroth-order logic containing n characters (see comments).
%C A344900 The characters of zeroth-order logic include the tilde (~), ampersand (&), wedge (∨), horseshoe (⊃), triple bar (≡), left and right parentheses, and variables (upper-case letters with or without subscripts.) However, since the set of upper-case letters with or without subscripts is infinitely large, it is then, for the sentences of zeroth-order logic containing k variables, restricted to the set {A1, ..., Ak}, with an additional restriction as follows: a sentence may only contain Ai iff it contains every Aj for j=1..i-1 (this gives a total of A000670(k-1) legal permutations for a sentence containing k variables.)
%C A344900 The rules for a well-formed formula (wff) of zeroth-order logic are defined recursively as follows (see M. Bergmann et al.):
%C A344900 1. Every variable is a wff.
%C A344900 2. If P is a wff, then so is ~P.
%C A344900 3. If P and Q are wffs, then so is (PxQ), where 'x' is any binary logical operator.
%C A344900 It is also customary to remove the outermost parentheses of a sentence.

%e A344900 a(4) = 25, since the number of sentences of zeroth-order logic containing four characters are as follows: ~~~A, ~AxA, Ax~A, ~AxB, Bx~A, ~BxA, and Ax~B, where 'x' is any of the four binary logical operators.
