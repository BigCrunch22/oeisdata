%N A344676 The number of n X n binary orthogonal matrices having an equal number of ones in each row.
%C A344676 The inverse of an orthogonal matrix is its transpose. This implies the dot product of a row with itself must be 1. This further implies the number of ones in each row must be odd. Given that orthogonal matrices form a group, it must be the case the transpose is also an orthogonal matrix. This requires every column of a binary orthogonal matrix also have an odd number of ones.
%C A344676 For 1 <= n <= 4 the counts are the same for the total number of binary orthogonal matrices (A003053).
%e A344676 a(7) = 5040. There are 5040 7 X 7 binary orthogonal matrices where all rows have an equal number of ones.
%Y A344676 Cf. A003053.
