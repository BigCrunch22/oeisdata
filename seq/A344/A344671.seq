%N A344671 a(n) is the total number of stable matchings for all possible preference profiles in the stable marriage problem with n men and n women such that there exists a married couple where the woman and the man rank each other last.
%C A344671 A man and a woman who rank each other last and end up in a marriage are called a hell-couple. A stable matching cannot have more than one hell-couple.
%C A344671 Given a profile, if there exists a stable matching with a hell-couple, then all the stable matchings for this profile have the same hell-couple.
%C A344671 The Gale-Shapley algorithm (both men-proposing and women-proposing) for such a profile needs at least n rounds to terminate.
%C A344671 A344670(n) is the number of preference profiles such that there exists a stable matching with a hell-couple.
%C A344671 This sequence is distinct from A344670 because in this sequence profiles are counted with their respective multiplicity if they yield multiple stable matchings with a hell-couple.

%e A344671 For n = 2, each preference profile that has a hell-couple has exactly one stable matching, thus a(2) = A344670(2) = 4. For n > 2, this is no longer the case and a(n) > A344670(n).
