%N A344331 Side s of squares of type 1 that can be tiled with squares of two different sizes so that the number of large or small squares is the same.
%C A344331 This sequence is relative to the generalization of the 4th problem proposed for the pupils in grade 6 during the 19th Mathematical Festival at Moscow in 2008 (see A344330).
%C A344331 There are two types of solutions, the first one is proposed here, while type 2 is described in A344332.
%C A344331 Some notations: s = side of the tiled squares, a = side of small squares, b = side of large squares, and z = number of small squares = number of large squares.
%C A344331 -> Primitive squares
%C A344331 Side s of primitive squares of type 1 must satisfy the Diophantine equation s^2 = z * (a^2+b^2), with gcd(a, b) = 1, and without using the conditions a^2+b^2 = c^2, when a and b belong to a Pythagorean triple (a, b, c).
%C A344331 In this case, the sides of the primitive squares of type 1 are s = a*b * (a^2+b^2) with 1 <= a < b and gcd(a, b) = 1 (A344333), then corresponding z = (a*b)^2 * (a^2+b^2) (A344334).
%C A344331 Every primitive square is composed of m = a*b * (a^2+b^2) elementary rectangles of length L = a^2+b^2 and width W = a*b, so with an area A = a*b * (a^2+b^2) = m.
%C A344331 In particular: for a = 1, b = n, s = n*(n^2+1) form the subsequence A034262 \ {0, 1} and z = n^2*(n^2+1) form the subsequence A071253 \ {0, 2}).
%C A344331 See example with design for a square of side s = 10 with a = 1, b = 2, m = 10, z = 20.
%C A344331 -> Non-primitive squares
%C A344331 If s is the side of a primitive square of type 1 with z squares of side a and z squares of side b, then every k * s is a non-primitive term that gives one or two distinct tilings of type 1, depending of value of k:
%C A344331 - For every k > 1, the square ks X ks can be tiled with k^2*z squares of side a and k^2*z squares of side b (see example).
%C A344331 - For every k = r^4, r>1, the square ks X ks also can be tiled with z squares of side ka and z squares of side kb.
%C A344331 ---> Consequences:
%C A344331 1) For every pair (a, b), 1 <= a < b, there is a square of side s = a*b * (a^2+b^2) that can be tiled with squares of side a and side b so that the number z of squares of side a and side b is the same, this number z = (a*b)^2 * (a^2+b^2).
%C A344331 2) If q is a term and K > 1, K * q is another term.
%C A344331 3) Every term is even.

%e A344331 - 20 is a non-primitive term because the square 20 X 20 can be tiled with 80 squares of size 1 X 1 and 80 squares of size 2 X 2.
%e A344331 - 30 is a primitive term because the square 30 X 30 can be tiled with 90 squares of size 1 X 1 and 90 squares of size 3 X 3, and no smaller square can be tiled with a same number of squares of size 1 X 1 and of squares of size 3 X 3,
%e A344331   but also, 30 is a non-primitive term because the square 30 X 30 can be tiled with 180 squares of size 1 X 1 and 180 squares of size 2 X 2.
