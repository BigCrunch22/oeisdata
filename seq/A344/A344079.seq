%N A344079 Numbers m such that A060649(m) > 0 and that C(-A060649(m)) is not cyclic, where C(D) is the class group of the quadratic field with discriminant D.
%C A344079 Assume that for all n, we have A060649(n) > 0 and either A344072(n) = 0 or A344072(n) > A060649(2n), then this sequence gives the indices where A060649 and A344073 differ.
%C A344079 All terms must be nonsquarefree, since an abelian group of squarefree order must be cyclic.
%e A344079 The smallest k == 3 (mod 4) such that Q(sqrt(-k)) has class number 12 is k = -231, but the class group of Q(sqrt(-231)) is isomorphic to C_2 X C_6, which is not cyclic, so 12 is a term.
%e A344079 The smallest k == 3 (mod 4) such that Q(sqrt(-k)) has class number 20 is k = -455, but the class group of Q(sqrt(-455)) is isomorphic to C_2 X C_10, which is not cyclic, so 20 is a term.
%e A344079 The smallest k == 3 (mod 4) such that Q(sqrt(-k)) has class number 637 is k = -149519, but the class group of Q(sqrt(-149519)) is isomorphic to C_7 X C_91, which is not cyclic, so 637 is a term.
