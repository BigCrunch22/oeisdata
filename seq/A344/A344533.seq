%N A344533 Given a square forest of n X n trees, with rows and columns separated by 1 meter, a(n) is the number of trees visible to an observer halfway along one side of the forest, exactly one meter outside.
%C A344533 This concept has been studied under the name "visible lattice points" although the usual version considers the points in an n X n grid that are visible from the origin. - _Jeffrey Shallit_, May 22 2021

%e A344533 For example, if the forest contains 5 X 5 trees, the observer will see only 17, as 8 will be hidden.
