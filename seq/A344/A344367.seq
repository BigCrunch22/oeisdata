%N A344367 Squares visited on a spirally numbered board when stepping to the closest unvisited square that contains a number that shares one or more digits with the number of the current square. If two or more such squares are the same distance away the one with the smaller number is chosen.

%e A344367 a(2) = 11. There are three squares 2 units away from the starting square 1 that also contain the digit 1 - 11, 15, and 19. Of these 11 is the smallest so is the square stepped to.
%e A344367 a(3) = 10. Of the two adjacent squares to 11 that also contain the digit 1 the square 10 is the smallest.
%e A344367 a(4) = 12. This is the only unvisited square within 2 units of a(3) = 10 that also contains the digit 1.
%e A344367 a(12) = 39. This is the only unvisited square within sqrt(2) units of a(11) = 19 that contains either the digit 3 or 9. It is also the first square stepped to that does not share the digit 1 with the previous square.
