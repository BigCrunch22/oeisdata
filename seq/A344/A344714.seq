%N A344714 Numbers k such that A008477(k) > k.
%C A344714 Not closed under multiplication: 8, 100 are terms, but 800 = 8 * 100 is in A008478. Obviously, the product of two coprime terms is again a term.
%C A344714 For primes p, p^e is a term if and only if p^e = 8, or p > e >= 2 and p^e != 9.
%H A344714 Jianing Song, <a href="/A344714/b344714.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..15731</a> (All terms <= 10^6).
%e A344714 For primes p >= 5, p^2 is a term since 2^p >= p^2.
%e A344714 98 is a term since A008477(98) = A008477(2^1 * 7^2) = 1^2 * 2^7 = 128 > 98.
