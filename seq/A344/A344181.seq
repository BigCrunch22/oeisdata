%N A344181 Numbers such that repeated division by their largest factorial divisor (as long as such a divisor larger than one exists) eventually yields 1.
%C A344181 Numbers whose closure under map x -> A076934(x) contains 1.
%C A344181 Largest factorial divisor of n is A000142(A055874(n)).
%C A344181 These numbers could be called "greedy Jordan-Polya numbers", as their presence in A001013 can be determined by a simple greedy algorithm.

%e A344181 12 = 2^2 * 3 is present, as the largest factorial that divides 12 is A000142(3) = 6, and then 12/6 = 2 is also divisible by a factorial, and then 2/A000142(2) = 1.
