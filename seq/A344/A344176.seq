%N A344176 Alternating parity Yellowstone permutation: a(n) = n if n <= 3, otherwise the smallest number not occurring earlier having at least one common factor with a(n-2), but none with a(n-1), with the condition that the terms in the sequence alternate parity.
%C A344176 Coincides with the Yellowstone permutation A098550 up to the term a(21).
%C A344176 The primes that appear at the same indices in both sequences are 2,3,5,7 and 13.  It seems these are the only ones since due to the alternating parity condition, the primes in a(n) appear at larger indices than in A098550 (however, there are composites that appear at the same indices in both sequences, for example a(47)=57 and a(52)=48).
%C A344176 Even with the alternating parity condition, the primes seem to appear in their natural order as in the Yellowstone permutation (conjecture 8 in A098550), except for 11 and 13, which appear in reverse order.
%C A344176 Unlike the Yellowstone permutation, there seems to be an infinite number of fixed points.
