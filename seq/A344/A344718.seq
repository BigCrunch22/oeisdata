%N A344718 Divide the positive integers into subsets of lengths given by successive primes. a(n) is the sum of primes contained in the n-th subset.

%e A344718 a(1) = 2 because the first subset is [1,2] (length = 2) and the sum of primes contained in it is 2.
%e A344718 a(2) = 8 because the second subset is [3,4,5] (length = 3) and the sum of primes contained in it is 3 + 5 = 8.
%e A344718 a(3) = 7 because the third subset is [6,7,8,9,10] (length = 5) and the sum of primes contained in it is 7.
%e A344718 a(4) = 41 because the fourth subset is [11,12,13,14,15,16,17] (length = 7) and the sum of primes contained in it is 11 + 13 + 17 = 41.
