%N A344938 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = number of k-sided polygons formed when every pair of vertices of a regular n-gon are joined by an infinite line, for k = 3, 4, ..., max_k.
%C A344938 See A344857 for examples and images of the polygons.
%F A344938 Sum of row(n) = A344857(n) = A344311(n) + A007678(n).
%e A344938 A pentagon with all vertices connected forms 10 triangles inside the pentagon, 5 triangles outside the pentagon, giving 15 triangles in all, and 1 smaller pentagon inside the pentagon, so row 3 is [15,0,1].
