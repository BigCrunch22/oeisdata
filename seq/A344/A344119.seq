%N A344119 Numbers k whose trajectory under the Reverse and Add! operation carried out in base 16 does not reach a palindrome and (presumably) does not join the trajectory of any term m < k.
%C A344119 A number is considered here (presumably) a Lychrel number in base 16 if it does not reach a palindrome within 200 steps more than the actual record. Those record numbers of steps to become palindromic are known from data in other bases not to increase that much (see for instance A065198 and A065199 in case of base 10). Furthermore, a Lychrel number is considered not to reach the trajectory of any smaller Lychrel number if it does not reach a trajectory of a smaller Lychrel number within 100 steps more than the actual record. Again, those record numbers of steps to reach the trajectory of a smaller Lychrel number are known from data in other bases not to increase that much (see for instance A323975 and A323976 in case of base 10).
%Y A344119 In other bases: A075252 (2), A077405 (3), A075421 (4), A306596 (8), A063048 (10).
%Y A344119 Cf. A065198, A065199, A323975, A323976.
