%F A344987 a(n) = Sum_{k=1..n} (pi(k) mod 2) * ((pi(2*n-k)+1) mod 2) * c(k) * c(2*n-k), where c(n) is the prime characteristic.
%F A344987 a(n) = A342301(n) - A344986(n).
%e A344987 a(12) = 2; 2*12 = 24 has 2 Goldbach partitions where the smaller prime has an odd index and the larger prime has an even index: (19,5) and (13,11). For example, 19 is the 8th prime and 5 is the 3rd, while 13 is the 6th prime and 11 is the 5th.
