%N A344670 a(n) is the number of preference profiles in the stable marriage problem with n men and n women such that there exists a stable matching with one couple where both the man and the woman rank each other last.
%C A344670 A man and a woman who rank each other last and end up in a marriage are called a hell-couple. A stable matching cannot have more than one hell-couple.
%C A344670 Given a profile, if there exists a stable matching with a hell-couple, then all the stable matchings for this profile have the same hell-couple.
%C A344670 The Gale-Shapley algorithm (both men-proposing and women-proposing) for such a profile needs at least n rounds to terminate.

%e A344670 For n = 2, there is a stable matching with a hell-couple if and only if the other two people rank each other first. Now, there are 2 ways to pair the men and women, and 2 ways to choose which couple has a man and woman ranking each other first, making a(2) = 2 * 2 = 4.
