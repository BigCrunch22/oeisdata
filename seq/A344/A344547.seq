%N A344547 Lexicographically earliest sequence of nonnegative terms forming a clockwise square spiral when nothing else is read except the parity of the terms (see the Comments section).
%C A344547 An even term turns the pencil 0 degrees to the right, then advances 1 unit; an odd term turns the pencil 90 degrees to the right, then advances 1 unit.
%e A344547 The pencil points towards the East before the start. The 0 doesn't change its orientation and a 1-unit line directed towards the East is traced. As 1 is odd, the pencil turns 90 degrees towards the South and a 1-unit line is traced. As 3 is odd, the pencil turns 90 degrees towards the West and a 1-unit line is traced. As 2 is even, the pencil doesn't change its orientation (towards the West) and a 1-unit line is traced. As 5 is odd, the pencil turns 90 degrees towards the North and a 1-unit line is traced. As 4 is even, the pencil doesn't change its orientation (towards the North) and a 1-unit line is traced. Etc.
%Y A344547 Cf. A344548 (same idea with digits), A174344 (an example of a clockwise square spiral).
