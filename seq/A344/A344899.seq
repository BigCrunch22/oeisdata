%N A344899 Number of polygon edges formed when every pair of vertices of a regular n-gon are joined by an infinite line.

%H A344899 Alexander Sidorenko, <a href="/A344857/a344857.txt">Explicit Formulas for Odd-Indexed Terms in A344899, A146212, and A344857.</a>
%F A344899 Conjectured formula odd n: a(n) = (n^4 - 7*n^3 + 17*n^2 - 11*n)/4 = (n-1)*n*(n^2-6*n+11)/4.
%F A344899 This formula is correct: see the Sidorenko link. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 12 2021
%F A344899 See also A344907.
%F A344899 a(n) = A344857(n) + A146212(n) - 1 (Euler's theorem.).
%e A344899 a(3) = 3 as the connected vertices form a triangle with three edges. Six infinite edges between the outer regions are also formed but these are not counted.
%e A344899 a(5) = 30 as the five connected vertices form a pentagon with fives lines along the pentagon's edges, fifteen lines inside forming eleven polygons, and ten lines outside forming another five triangles. In all these sixteen polygons form thirty edges. Twenty infinite edges between the outer regions are also formed.
