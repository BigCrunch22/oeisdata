%N A344275 Denominators of worst rational approximations to the golden ratio.
%C A344275 These are positive integers k such that ||k*phi||/k > ||m*phi||/m for all integers m > k, where phi = (1+sqrt(5))/2 is the golden ratio, and ||x|| is the distance from x to the nearest integer. Luke Schaeffer (personal communication) asks for a formula for these.
%C A344275 Conjecture: difference of consecutive terms is always a Fibonacci number.
