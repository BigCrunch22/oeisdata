%N A344383 a(n) is the number of steps needed to reach 1 (or -1 if 1 is never reached) using the following rule: Begin with k = n. On each step, if k is divisible by 9, then divide it by 9; otherwise, if k has not already appeared during the iterative process, concatenate k with the digit d which makes the resulting number divisible by 9, and divide by 9; otherwise, concatenate d with k, and divide by 9.
%C A344383 It appears that all numbers will go to 1 eventually.
%C A344383 Count the iterations to reach 1, starting at k = n, using the following rule for each iteration: If k is divisible by 9, then divide it by 9; otherwise, concatenate the digit d = 9 - (k mod 9) to the end of k and divide by 9, unless k has already appeared during the iterative process; in this case, concatenate d with k and divide by 9.
%C A344383 Least n whose trajectory has no instance of repeated terms is 1; the trajectory of n=31 has 1 repeated term, and that of n=96 has 2 repeated terms. 2 repeated terms is the maximum for 1 <= n <= 2^18. Trajectories for all n in 1..2^20 eventually reach 1. - _Michael De Vlieger_, May 16 2021
%C A344383 Trajectories for all values of n between 1 and 10^8 eventually reach 1. - _Kyle Peterson_, May 19 2021

%e A344383 n=7: start with k=7;
%e A344383 iteration 1: concatenate 7 with 9 - (7 mod 9) = 9 - 7 = 2 to get 72, then divide by 9, yielding k=8;
%e A344383 iteration 2: concatenate 8 with 9 - (8 mod 9) = 9 - 8 = 1 to get 81, then divide by 9, yielding k=9;
