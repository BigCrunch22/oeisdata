%N A344689 a(n) is the number of preference profiles in the stable marriage problem with n men and n women such that one man and one woman are ranked last by all the people of the opposite gender except each other.
%C A344689 The members of such a pair of people are called outcasts. The outcasts must be matched with each other in any stable matching independently of how they rank each other.
%C A344689 For n other than 2, there can be at most one pair of outcasts.
%C A344689 The number of profiles where the pair of outcasts exists and they rank each other last is A343474(n).

%F A344689 a(n) = n^4*(n-1)!^(2n) for n != 2; a(2) = 14.
%e A344689 Each person makes a ranking list for all members of the opposite gender without ties. The outcasts are ranked n-th (last) by at least n-1 persons of the opposite gender. This is why for n>2 at most one pair of outcasts can exist.
%e A344689 For n>2, we have n^2 ways to pick the two outcasts, then n!^2 ways to complete the outcasts' preference profiles, and finally (n-1)!^(2n-2) ways to complete everyone else's profiles.
