%N A344409 Positive discriminants of orders with class number 3.
%C A344409 Also positive discriminants of orders with class group isomorphic to C_3.
%C A344409 The fundamental terms are listed in A094612.
%C A344409 It seems that for most k in this sequence, 4*k is also in this sequence. The smallest k such that this is not true is k = 564.
%C A344409 Conjecture: if a term k is congruent to 4 modulo 16, then k/4 is either here or in A133315; if a term k is congruent to 0 modulo 16, then k/4 is in this sequence.
%C A344409 Conjecture: a term k is in A006832 if and only if k/4 is not in this sequence.
