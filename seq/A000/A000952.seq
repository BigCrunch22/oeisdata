%N A000952 Numbers n == 2 (mod 4) that are the orders of conference matrices.
%C A000952 A conference matrix of order n is an n X n {-1,0,+1} matrix A such that A A' = (n-1)I.
%C A000952 If n == 2 (mod 4) then a necessary condition is that n-1 is a sum of 2 squares (A286636). It is conjectured that this condition is also sufficient. If n == 2 (mod 4) and n-1 is a prime or prime power the condition is automatically satisfied.

%E A000952 66 seems to be the smallest order for which it is not known if a matrix exists. Since 65 is the sum of two squares, according to the conjecture, 66 should be the next term.
