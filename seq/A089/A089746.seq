%N A089746 Period 12: repeat (4, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3). (Number of syllables in English name of the months.)
%C A089746 Original definition: Number of syllables in English name of n-th month, with comment: Period 12.
%C A089746 The original definition corresponds to the finite subsequence a(1)..a(12). There is no 13th month of the year. If "of the year" is omitted on purpose, there's no reason that the 1st month be January: the first day of the currently used Gregorian calendar was October 15, 1582, so the 1st month should be October. Originally the first month was March (whence the names September, ..., December for the 7th, ..., 10th month) and January was the 11th month. - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 25 2018
