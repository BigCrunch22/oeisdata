%N A089842 Order of each element (row) in A089840, 0 if not finite.
%C A089842 If a(n) is nonzero, then the n-th non-recursive Catalan Automorphism in A089840 does not have orbits (cycles) larger than that and the corresponding LCM-sequence will set to a constant sequence a(n),a(n),a(n),a(n),... E.g. A089840[4] = A089851 is obtained by rotating three subtrees cyclically and its LCM-sequence begins as 1,1,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,... (a(4)=3). Similarly, A089840[15] = A089859, whose LCM-sequence begins as 1,1,2,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,.... (a(15)=4). In contrast, the Max. cycle and LCM-sequence (A089410) of A089840[12] (= A074679) exhibits genuine growth, thus a(12)=0.
