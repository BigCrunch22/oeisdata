%N A089655 a(1)=1 and for n>=2 a(n) is the denominator of A(n) (see comment for A(n) definition).
%C A089655 For n>=2, A(n) is the least rational value >1 such that A(n)*(n^(2k)-1)*B(2k) is an integer value for k=1 up to 200, where B(2k) is the 2k-th Bernoulli number. It appears that sequence of numerators of A(n) coincide with A007947 (terms were computed by _W. Edwin Clark_). We conjecture : A(n)*(n^(2k)-1)*B(2k) is an integer value for all k>0.
%F A089655 It appears that if p is prime and 2^p-1 and (2^p+1)/3 are both primes (i.e. p is in A000043 and in A000978), then a(2^p)=(4^p-1)/3 (converse doesn't hold).
%F A089655 For n>1 a(n)=(n^2-1)/rad(n^2-1) where rad(k) is the squarefree kernel of k; a(n)=A003557(n^2-1) - _Benoit Cloitre_, Oct 26 2004
