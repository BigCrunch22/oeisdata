%N A089243 Number of partitions into strokes of the star graph with n edges on the plane, up to rotations and reflections around the center node.
%C A089243 A "stroke" is defined as follows. If the following conditions are satisfied then the partition to directed paths on a directed graph is called "a partition to strokes on a directed graph", and all directed paths in the partition are called "strokes". C.1. Two different directed paths in a partition do not have the same edges. C.2. A union of two different paths in a partition does not become a directed path. In other words, a "stroke" is a locally maximal path on a directed graph.
%C A089243 This sequence has its origin in the strokes made when writing Japanese Kanji.
%C A089243 The value a(1) is ambiguous as it depends on the definition of the star graph with n = 1 edge. If one of the edge endpoints is labeled as the star center, then we have the current value a(1) = 2. However, if the center is not distinguished, then a(1) would be 1. - _Max Alekseyev_, May 04 2023

%e A089243 For n = 3, call the center node "0" and the terminal nodes "1", "2", "3".
%e A089243 Four partitions exist as follows:
%e A089243   {1->0->2, 0->3}
%e A089243   {1->0->2, 3->0}
%e A089243   {1->0, 2->0, 3->0}
%e A089243   {0->1, 0->2, 0->3}.
%e A089243 So a(3) = 4.
