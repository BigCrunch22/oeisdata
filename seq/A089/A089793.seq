%N A089793 a(n) = the first prime in the earliest chain of 2n+1 consecutive primes whose sum is prime.
%C A089793 In general (except possibly when it begins with 2), the sum of an even number of consecutive primes is even - hence the restriction to odd chain lengths.

%e A089793 17 is the first prime in the chain 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, which is the earliest chain of 2 * 3 + 1 = 7 consecutive primes whose sum, 197, is prime. Hence a(3) = 17.
