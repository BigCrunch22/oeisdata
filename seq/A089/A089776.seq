%N A089776 If n mod 10 is 1, 3, 7, or 9, then a(n) = least prime of the form 1 followed by n^r; else a(n) = least prime of the form n^r followed by a 1. In both cases r must be > 1 and a(n) = 0 if no such prime exists.
%C A089776 Subsidiary sequence: 3 more sequences can be obtained by replacing 1 by 3,7 and 9.
%F A089776 If n is divisible by 2 or 5, a(n) = A088622(n); otherwise a(n) = A088623(n). - _David Wasserman_, Oct 12 2005
%e A089776 a(12) = 0 because 1+10*12^r is always divisible by 11.
%e A089776 a(32) = 0 because 1+10*32^r is divisible by 3 if r is odd and by 11 if r is even.
