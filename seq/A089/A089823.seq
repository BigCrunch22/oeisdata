%N A089823 Primes p such that the next prime after p can be obtained from p by adding the product of the digits of p.
%C A089823 I call these primes (multiplicative) "pointer primes", in the sense that such primes p "point" to the next prime after p when the product of the digits of p is added to p. 23 is the only pointer prime < 10^7 which does not contain the digit "1". Are there other pointer primes not containing the digit "1"?
%C A089823 See Prime Puzzle 251 link for several arguments that 23 is the only pointer prime not containing digit "1".

%e A089823 23 + product of digits of 23 = 29, which is the next prime after 23. Hence 23 belongs to the sequence.
