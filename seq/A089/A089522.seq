%N A089522 a(n) = smallest non-palindromic number k such that the Reverse and Add! trajectory of k joins the trajectory of A089521(n).
%C A089522 Terms of A063048 that are not terms of A088753 (not in ascending order). a(n) > A088753(n). a(n) is the substitute so to speak of A088753(n) in A063048.
%C A089522 a(12), a(15) to a(18), a(20), a(21) are conjectural; it is not yet ensured that they are minimal.
