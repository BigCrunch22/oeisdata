%N A089939 T(i,j) = 1 if F(i) AND F(j) = 0, otherwise 0, where F is A003714 and AND is the bitwise logical-and operation. Table read by antidiagonals.
%C A089939 Encodes which row/column patterns may be adjacent in 01-matrices where no two 0 elements may be adjacent. Contains many interesting recursive patterns such as Fibonacci-sized blocks of 0's along main diagonal.
%e A089939 T(3,4) = 0 because F(3) AND F(4) = 4 AND 5 = 1, which is nonzero.
