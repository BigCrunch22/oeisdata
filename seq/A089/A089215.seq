%N A089215 Thue-Morse sequence on the integers.
%C A089215 Sequence is S(infinity) where S(1)={1,2} and S(n+1)=S(n)S'(n) where S'(n) is obtained from S(n) by substituting an element x of S(n) with M(n)-x where M(n)=2+Max{S(n)}.
%C A089215 For comparison, the Thue-Morse sequence on alphabet {1,2} is constructed as follows: S(1)={1,2} and S(n+1)=S(n)S'(n) where S'(n) is obtained from S(n) by substituting an element x of S(n) with 3-x.
%F A089215 Sum_{k=1..n} a(k) is asymptotic to C*n*log(n) with C=0.8....
%F A089215 a(n) = A209281(n) + 1. - _Kevin Ryde_, Jun 25 2022
%e A089215 S(1)={1,2} then M(1)=4 and S'(1)={4-1,4-2}={3,2}. So S(2)={1,2,3,2}. M(2)=5 so S(3)={1,2,3,2}{5-1,5-2,5-3,5-2} and sequence begins 1,2,3,2,4,3,2,3,...
