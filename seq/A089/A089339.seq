%N A089339 Number of primes beginning with n and of the form n concatenated with p where p takes all the prime values less than n.
%C A089339 Conjecture: There are finitely many zeros in this sequence. What is the largest value of n such that a(n) = 0? Perhaps n = 14.
%e A089339 a(10) = 2 and 103 and 107 are the associated primes.
