%N A089829 Triangle T(p,k) read by rows, where p runs through the odd primes and 2 <= k <= p-1. T(p,k) = 1 if the reverse of the base-k expansion of p is a prime, otherwise 0.
%C A089829 Row p has p-2 terms.
%C A089829 A very large version of this pyramid, with 1's replaced with white dots and 0's replaced with black dots, shows a very interesting pattern (see link). The author says: "These primes form a pattern similar to an astronomical radiant (the point in the sky from which a meteor shower appears to originate)".

%e A089829 Writing 11 in bases 2 through 10, we obtain
%e A089829 1011,102,23,21,15,14,13,12,11. Reversing these, we obtain
%e A089829 1101,201,32,12,51,41,31,21,11. Now 32 (base 4) and 31 (octal) are composite, all others are prime, so the row for 11 reads.
