%N A089374 Numbers n such that the concatenation (in descending order) of all the divisors of n, with 1 in the least significant position, is prime (or 1).
%C A089374 See A176558(n) = reverse concatenation of divisors of n. See A175355 for corresponding values of reverse concatenations. Complement of A175354(n) for n >= 2. - _Jaroslav Krizek_, Apr 20 2010
%C A089374 If prime p divides n, then the exponent of p in the prime factorization of n is odd if p == 1 (mod 3) and even if p == 2 (mod 3).  In particular, the sequence has no terms == 2 (mod 3). - _Robert Israel_, Apr 21 2020

%e A089374 4 is a term as 421 is prime; 39 is a term as concatenation of 39,13,3 and 1, i.e. 391331, is prime.
%e A089374 25 is a member as 2551 is prime.
%e A089374 Divisors of 39 are 1,3,13,39; reverse concatenation of divisors 391331 is prime.
%e A089374 48 is a member as 48241612864321 is a prime.
