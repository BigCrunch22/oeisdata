%N A360179 a(1) = 1. Thereafter if a(n-1) is a novel term, a(n) = d(a(n-1)); otherwise a(n) = a(n-1) + d(u), where d is the divisor function A000005 and u is the smallest unstarred prior term (each time we use a prior term we star it, and starred terms cannot be reused).
%C A360179 Whilst the definition is subtly different from that of A345147, d(u) being used in place of u, the scatterplots are remarkably different, the one for this sequence displaying numerous precipitous "gorges" which are open to explanation. 1 is the only number which occurs precisely twice, all other numbers are repeated infinitely many times.
%C A360179 From _Michael De Vlieger_, Apr 04 2023: (Start)
%C A360179 The sequence is a series of nondecreasing cycles that reach a maximum M and then reset to start a new cycle. (See scatterplot B.)
%C A360179 The sequence is dynamic and responds to a bank of copies of the same number called a "prevailing low" L. When M < L, the sequence experiences a run of short or "crashed" cycles that make no headway at eliminating the copies of L, resulting in a "gorge" in the scatterplot.
%C A360179 Referring to scatterplot A:
%C A360179 The green line represents the smallest missing number u and is not actually a feature of the sequence. The red line represents the "prevailing low" L(n), also is not a feature of the sequence.
%C A360179 Dark blue terms a(n) = tau(a(n-1))..421 populate a "semi-coherent" phase (1A) of cycle c(i), where tau(n) = A000005(n).
%C A360179 Light blue terms a(n) = 422..L populate the "coherent" phase (1B) of cycle c(i). Black terms m > L populate phase (2) of c(i).
%C A360179 Magenta terms constitute a crashed cycle that has M < L; multiple consecutive crashed cycles constitute a gorge. In crashed cycles, we have only phase (1).
%C A360179 The "triple point" of the graph, where we first have phase (1B), appears to be a(14478) = 414, but is in actuality (given 2^20 terms) a(14786) = 422. (End)

%e A360179 a(2) = 1 since a(1) = 1 is a novel term and d(1) = 1. Thus the sequence starts 1,1 and since a(2) is a repeated term, a(3) = a(2) + d(1) (1 = least unstarred prior term). Therefore a(3) = 1 + 1 = 2.
