%N A360227 The succession of the digits of the sequence is the same when each term is multiplied by 11.
%C A360227 This is the lexicographically earliest sequence of positive distinct terms with this property. A similar sequence could be computed with a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 12 but that sequence would not be the lexicographically earliest one showing the property. If we try the sequence starting with a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 10, we immediately see that no a(3) can extend the sequence (this is due to the digit "0" present in 10).
%e A360227 The values of a(n) * 11 begin:
%e A360227    1 * 11 = 11,
%e A360227   11 * 11 = 121,
%e A360227    2 * 11 = 22,
%e A360227   12 * 11 = 132,
%e A360227   21 * 11 = 231,
%e A360227    3 * 11 = 33,
%e A360227   22 * 11 = 242, etc.
%e A360227 We see that the succession of digits in the first column is the same as the succession of digits in the last column.
%Y A360227 Cf. A362433.
