%N A360566 Level sizes of numerator-denominator-incrementing tree of rationals in (0,1).
%C A360566 Construct a tree of rational numbers by starting with a root labeled 1/2. Then iteratively add children to each node as follows: to the node labeled p/q in lowest terms, add children labeled with any of p/(q+1) and (p+1)/q that are less than one and have not already appeared in the tree. Then a(n) is the number of nodes n-3 levels below the root (the offset 3 is chosen so that the level number corresponds to the sum of the numerator and denominator of most fractions at level n).
%C A360566 This construction is similar to the Farey tree except that the children of p/q are its mediants with 0/1 and 1/0 (if those mediants have not already occurred), rather than its mediants with its nearest neighbors among its ancestors.
%C A360566 It might appear at first glance that the sum of the numerator and denominator of all fractions at level n divides n. However, 7/10 and 8/9 first appear at level 33 (as children of 7/9 at level 32), but 17 does not divide 33.
%C A360566 Since 1/(n-1) always appears on level n, a(n) > 0. Bertrand's postulate implies that for all n > 5, a(n) > 1, since for each prime p with n/2 < p < n, (n+1-p)/p will also occur at level n.
%C A360566 For a proof that the tree described above includes all rational numbers between 0 and 1, see Gordon and Whitney.

%e A360566 To build the tree, 1/2 only has child 1/3, since 2/2 = 1 is outside of (0,1). Then 1/3 has children 1/4 and 2/3. In turn, 1/4 only has child 1/5 because 2/4 = 1/2 has already occurred, and 2/3 has no children because 2/4 has already occurred and 3/3 is too large. Continuing in this fashion, the first few levels of the tree look like:
%e A360566 1/2
%e A360566  |
%e A360566 1/3
