%N A360536 Analog of Rudin-Shapiro sum sequence A020990, based on counting patterns 00 instead of 11.
%C A360536 a(n) = Sum_{i=0..n} (-1)^(i+e(i)), where e(i) counts the (possibly overlapping) occurrences of 00 in the base-2 representation of n.  Note that e(0) = 0.  This is the analog of A020990, which is the same sum, but with e(n) replaced by the function that counts the (possibly overlapping) occurrences of 11 in the base-2 representation of n.
