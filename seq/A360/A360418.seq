%N A360418 Numbers k such that, in a listing of all congruence classes of positive integers, the k-th congruence class contains k. Here the class r mod m (with r in {1,...,m}) precedes the class a' mod b' (with r' in {1,...,m'}) iff m < m' or r > r'.
%C A360418 The sequence appears to be the interleaving of the four sequences A080856, A102083, A360416, A360417. This has been verified for values of k up to one million as of February 06 2023.
%e A360418 The 1st congruence class in the list (with m=1 and r=1) is {1,2,3,...} which contains 1, so 1 is in the sequence. The 2nd congruence class (with m=2 and r=2) is {2,4,6,...} which contains 2, so 2 is in the sequence. The 3rd congruence class (with m=2 and r=1) is {1,3,5,...} which contains 3, so 3 is in the sequence. The 4th congruence class (with m=3 and r=3) is {3,6,9,...} which does not contain 4, so 4 is not in the sequence.
