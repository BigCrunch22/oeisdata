%N A360110 Nonmultiples of 4 whose arithmetic derivative is a multiple of 4.
%C A360110 A multiplicative semigroup; if m and n are in the sequence then so is m*n.
%C A360110 Terms > 1 do not form a subsequence of A327934: Here 189 = 3^3 * 7 is present, although it is missing from A327934.
%C A360110 This is a subsequence of A046337, numbers with an even number of odd prime factors (with multiplicity). The semiprimes that occur here are all of the type (4m-1)*(4n+1), i.e., in A080774. A product of four odd primes (A046317) occurs here if either all of the primes have the same remainder modulo 4 (i.e., either all are of the type 4m-1 or all are of the type 4m+1), or two are of the other type, and two are of the other type. This follows because A003415(p*q*r*s) = (pqr + pqs + prs + qrs), while the product of four odd primes with just one prime of the different type are all located in A327862. - _Antti Karttunen_, Feb 05 2024

%e A360110 189 = 3^3 * 7 has arithmetic derivative 189' = A003415(189) = 216 = 2^3 * 3^3. Because 189 is not a multiple of 4, but 216 is, 189 is included in this sequence.
