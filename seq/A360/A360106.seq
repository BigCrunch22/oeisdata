%N A360106 Number of length-n blocks of the Fibonacci infinite word (A003849), counted up to cyclic shift.
%C A360106 "Counted up to cyclic shift" means two blocks that are cyclic shifts of each other are treated as the same.

%F A360106 There is a linear representation of rank 20 to compute a(n), so it can be computed efficiently.
%e A360106 For n = 8 the a(8) = 2 blocks counted are {01001010, 10100101}.
