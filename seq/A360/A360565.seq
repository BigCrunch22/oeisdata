%N A360565 Denominators of breadth-first numerator-denominator-incrementing enumeration of rationals in (0,1).
%C A360565 Construct a tree of rational numbers by starting with a root labeled 1/2. Then iteratively add children to each node breadth-first as follows: to the node labeled p/q in lowest terms, add children labeled with any of p/(q+1) and (p+1)/q (in that order) that are less than one and have not already appeared in the tree. Then a(n) is the denominator of the n-th rational number (in lowest terms) added to the tree.
%C A360565 This construction is similar to the Farey tree except that the children of p/q are its mediants with 0/1 and 1/0 (if those mediants have not already occurred), rather than its mediants with its nearest neighbors among its ancestors.
%C A360565 For a proof that the tree described above includes all rational numbers between 0 and 1, see Gordon and Whitney.

%e A360565 To build the tree, 1/2 only has child 1/3, since 2/2 = 1 is outside of (0,1). Then 1/3 has children 1/4 and 2/3. In turn, 1/4 only has child 1/5 because 2/4 = 1/2 has already occurred, and 2/3 has no children because 2/4 has already occurred and 3/3 is too large. Thus, the sequence begins 2, 3, 4, 3, 5, ... (the denominators of 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 2/3, 1/5, ...).
