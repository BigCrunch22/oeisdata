%N A360845 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the state of the k-th light after n steps of the light switch problem, 1 <= k <= A003418(n).
%C A360845 The light switch problem posits an infinite number of ordinally numbered lights which are initially off.
%C A360845 The 1st step turns all lights on.
%C A360845 The 2nd step turns every second one off leaving only odd lights illuminated.
%C A360845 The 3rd step reverses the state of every light having a number divisible by 3.
%C A360845 Every n-th step thereafter reverses the state of lights with numbers divisible by n.
%C A360845 The problem asks which lights are on as n is allowed to be arbitrarily large and the solution is all n where d(n) (A000005) is odd, i.e., the squares A000290.  Alternatively, if 0 represents a light that is off and 1 a light that is on, the solution is represented by A010052 with offset 1.
%C A360845 This sequence considers intermediate solutions to arrive at A010052.  After the n-th step, the lights will have a pattern which must repeats at most every LCM of {1..n} (sequence A003418).  This sequence is an irregular triangle read by rows of the n-th repeating sequence.

%F A360845 T(n,k) = (Sum_{d|k, d<=n} 1) mod 2.
%F A360845 T(n,k) = A138553(n,k) mod 2.
%F A360845 T(n,k) = A010052(k) for n >= k.
