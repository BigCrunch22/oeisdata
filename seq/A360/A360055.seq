%N A360055 Number of L-connected free polyominoes with n cells (see comments for definition).
%C A360055 By "L-connected" we mean that every pair of cells in the polyomino can be connected by a chain of cells in the polyomino, consisting of a vertical chain and a horizontal chain that share one of their end cells.
%C A360055 We consider the empty polyomino, or "nullomino" to be L-connected because there are no pairs of cells, so the universal quantifier in the definition is trivially satisfied.
%C A360055 The entries through n = 6 were hand-counted by _Allan C. Wechsler_, and _John Mason_ confirmed those entries and extended the data through n = 18.

%e A360055 For n = 4 the 4 solutions are the straight tetromino, the L tetromino, the T tetromino, and the square tetromino. The skew or S tetromino is not L-connected, because there is no qualifying path between the two most distant cells.
