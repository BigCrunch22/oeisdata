%N A360499 Number of ways to tile an n X n square using rectangles with distinct dimensions.
%C A360499 All possible tilings are counted, including those identical by symmetry. Note that distinct dimensions means that, for example, a 1 x 3 rectangle can only be used once, regardless of if it lies horizontally or vertically.
%e A360499 a(1) = 1 as the only way to tile a 1 x 1 square is with a square with dimensions 1 x 1.
%e A360499 a(2) = 1 as the only way to tile a 2 x 2 square is with a square with dimensions 2 x 2.
%e A360499 a(3) = 21. The possible tilings, excluding those equivalent by symmetry, are:
