%N A360476 The integers of the sequence appear exactly twice. Between the two copies of k there are k odd integers. The sequence is always extended with the smallest integer not leading to a contradiction.
%e A360476 There is one odd integer between the two 1s: this is the integer 3;
%e A360476 there are two odd integers between the two 2s: they are 3 and 1;
%e A360476 there are three odd integers between the two 3s: they are 1, 5 and 7; etc.
