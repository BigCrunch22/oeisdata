%N A360209 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive numbers such that, for n > 2, a(n) shares a factor with a(n-2) + a(n-1) but shares no factor with a(n-2).
%C A360209 To ensure the sequence is infinite another criterion must be satisfied when choosing a(n), namely a(n) + a(n-1) must contain a factor not in a(n-1). If this were not the case, a(n+1) = a(n) + a(n-1) would share a factor with both a(n) + a(n-1) and a(n-1), terminating the sequence.
%C A360209 In the first 100000 terms the fixed points for n > 2 are 3, 7, 8, 12, 66, 411, 671, 1045, 1351, although it is likely more exist. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
%H A360209 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A360209/a360209.png">Image for n=1..100000</a>. The green line is a(n) = n.
%e A360209 a(8) = 8 as a(6) + a(7) = 3 + 7 = 10, and 8 is the smallest positive unused number that shares a factor with 10 but not with a(6) = 3.
%e A360209 a(10) = 35 as a(8) + a(9) = 8 + 6 = 14, and 35 shares a factor with 14 but not with a(8) = 8. Note that 21 also satisfies these criteria but 6 + 21 = 27 which shares all its factors with a(9) = 6, thus setting a(10) = 21 would make it impossible to find a(11).
