%N A360257 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the number of preceding terms having the same sum of divisors as a(n-1).
%C A360257 The most common sum of divisor count of all previous terms changes as n increases; these values, up to 2 million terms, are 1, 12, 24, 12, 24, 72, 720, 72, 720, 72, 720, 72, 720. The value 72 holds the record from a(6998) = 71 to a(1271035) = 563. After a(1285242) = 264 the divisor sum 720 becomes the most common sum to well beyond 10 million terms. It is likely the record becomes arbitrarily large as n increases.

%e A360257 a(22) = 2 as a(21) = 11 and 11 has a divisor sum of A000203(11) = 12. However, A000203(6) also equals 12, and as a(11) = 6 there are two previous terms with a divisor sum of 12.
