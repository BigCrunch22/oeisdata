%N A360104 Number of length-n blocks of the Thue-Morse infinite word (A010060), counted up to cyclic shift.
%C A360104 "Counted up to cyclic shift" means two blocks that are cyclic shifts of each other are treated as the same.
%C A360104 It is known that a(n) >= (4/3)n - 4 for n >= 0 and a(n) <= 2n-4 for n >= 3.

%F A360104 There is a linear representation of rank 10 to compute a(n), so it can be computed efficiently.
%e A360104 For n = 5 the a(5) = 4 blocks counted are {00110, 01101, 10011, 10100}.
