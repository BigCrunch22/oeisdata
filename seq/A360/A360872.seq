%N A360872 Irregular triangle read by rows of the length of runs in intermediate solutions to the light switch problem.
%C A360872 The light switch problem posits an infinite number of ordinally numbered lights which are initially off.
%C A360872 The 1st step turns all lights on.
%C A360872 The 2nd step turns every second one off leaving only odd lights illuminated.
%C A360872 The 3rd step reverses the state of every light having a number divisible by 3.
%C A360872 Every n-th step thereafter reverses the state of lights with numbers divisible by n.
%C A360872 The problem asks which lights are on as n is allowed to be arbitrarily large and the solution is all n where d(n) (A000005) is odd i.e. the squares A000290.  Alternatively, if 0 represents a light that is off and 1 a light that is on, the solution is represented by A010052 with offset 1.
%C A360872 This sequence considers intermediate solutions to arrive at A010052.  After the n-th step, the lights will have a pattern which must repeat at most every LCM of {1...n} (A003418) and is given by A360845.  This sequence counts the runs of 0's and 1's for each row of the irregular triangle in A360845.
