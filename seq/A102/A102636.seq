%N A102636 Skipping from prime to prime by least powers of 2 using 127 as the seed.
%C A102636 By skipping least power of 2, the numbers in sequence A033875 reaches an enormous element at n=22. The next not merged sequence starts from 53 and gets to a big number at n=7 (A102635). Can this sort of sequence with relatively more small primes? The next sequence seeded 127 (this sequence). It gets 19 elements within n<1000.
%F A102636 a(1) = 127, a(n+1) = a(n) + 2^k; a(n+1) prime, k minimal.
%e A102636 127+2^2 = 131 is prime
%e A102636 33892081+2^8 = 33892337 is prime
