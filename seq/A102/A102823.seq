%N A102823 "True already", base 10, start 0: a(n) is the least integer such that the sequence up to a(n-1) written in base 10 contains floor(a(n)/10) copies of the digit a(n) % 10, with a(0) = 0.
%C A102823 a(n) = A249626(n) for n <= 55. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Nov 03 2014
%D A102823 Inspired by discussion of "True so far" from _Eric Angelini_ (A102357).
%e A102823 The first 11 values of the sequence written in decimal include 2 '1's and 1 '2', so the next value cannot be 11 (the count of '1's is not 1) but can be 12.
