%N A102506 Numbers n such that for some positive number k, z=n+ik is a complex multiperfect number; that is, z divides sigma(z), where sigma is the sum of divisors function extended to the complex numbers.
%C A102506 This sequence uses a number-theoretic extension of the sigma function that is due to Spira. A nonzero Gaussian integer has a unique factorization as u q1^e1 q2^e2..qn^en, where u is a unit (1,-1,i,-i), the qk are Gaussian primes in the first quadrant and the ek are positive integers.
%C A102506 Then Spira defines the sum of divisors to be Product_{k=1..n} (qk^(ek+1)-1)/(qk-1). This appears to be the natural number-theoretic extension. Spira's definition preserves the multiplicative property: if GCD(x,y)=1, then sigma(x*y)=sigma(x)*sigma(y). (Mathematica's DivisorSigma function uses this formula.)
%C A102506 It appears that the value of k, A102507, is unique for each n. The sum of divisors function, as defined by Spira, is implemented in Mathematica for complex z as the DivisorSigma[1,z]. For the z=n+ik given here, sigma(z)/z is usually a small Gaussian integer. The first instance of a positive integral value of sigma(z)/z is z=600+3800i, in which case the ratio is 3. The complex multiperfect numbers can be arranged into classes according to the value of sigma(z)/z. Does each class have a finite number of members?

%e A102506 For n=1, we have z=1+3i. The divisors of z are 1, 1+i, 1+3i and 2+i. Hence sigma(z)=5+5i and sigma(z)/z = 2-i.

%Y A102506 Cf. A102507. Note that A101367 and A101366 use Mathematica's Divisors function, the sum of the first-quadrant divisors, which does not enjoy the nice multiplicative properties of Spira's sigma function.
