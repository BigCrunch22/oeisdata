%N A102549 Optimal (best known) sequence of increments for shell sort algorithm.
%C A102549 Values were found empirically. Better than A033622, A036562, A036564, A036569, and A055875.

%e A102549 a(0) = 1 performs a single pass of Shellsort with a gap size of 1 (which is identical to the Insertion Sort algorithm).
%e A102549 a(1) = 4 performs a single pass of Shellsort with a gap size of 4 (exchanging elements 4 positions apart if they are out of order).
%Y A102549 Cf. A033622, A036562, A036564, A036569, A055875.
