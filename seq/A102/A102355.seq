%N A102355 Any digit "d" (except the first two) is the absolute difference between x and y -> x=sum of the 2 digits standing immediately to the left of "d", y=sum of the 2 digits standing immediately to the right of "d".
%C A102355 To build such sequences, repeat one of those three patterns and insert commas accordingly: i) 0aaaa -> 0aaaa0aaaa0aaaa... -> 0,1,11,101,1110,11110... j) 0abab -> 0abab0abab0abab... -> 0,4,9,490,494,904,9490... k) 0a00a -> 0a00a0a00a0a00a... -> 0,700,70700,7070070,...
%e A102355 The first "2" is the absolute difference (0+1)-(1+2);
%e A102355 the following "1" is the result of (2+1)-(2+0);
%e A102355 the following "2" is the result of (1+2)-(0+1);
%e A102355 the following "0" is the result of (1+2)-(1+2)...
