%N A102046 Smallest positive integer greater than a(n - 1) consistent with the condition that n is a member of the sequence if and only if a(n) is congruent to (n!)!.
%C A102046 The sequence is related to the fake even and fake odd sequences and also the factorial and double factorial sequences, so seems in the short run linear but in the long run exponential.
%F A102046 a(a(n)) = (n!)!
%e A102046 a(6) = 720 because (3!)! = 6! = 720
%Y A102046 Cf. A080591, A080588, A000197, A000142.
