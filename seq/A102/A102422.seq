%N A102422 Number of partitions of n with k <= 5 parts and each part p <= 5.
%C A102422 There are only 26 nonzero terms.
%C A102422 Contribution from _Toby Gottfried_, Feb 19 2009: (Start)
%C A102422 a(n) is the number of partitions of n+5 into exactly 5 parts with each part p: 1 <= p <= 6
%C A102422 i.e. the number of different ways to get a total of n+5 with 5 (normal, 6-sided) dice in any order (End)

%e A102422 a(7)=11 because we can write 7=1+2+2+2 or 5+2 or 1+2+4 or 3+4 or 1+3+3 or 1+1+1+1+3 or 1+1+2+3 or 2+2+3 or 1+1+1+2+2 1+1+1+4 or 1+1+5.
%e A102422 A total of 8 comes from 1+1+1+1+4, 1+1+1+2+3, 1+1+2+2+2 and a(3) = 3 [8 = 3+5] [From _Toby Gottfried_, Feb 19 2009]
