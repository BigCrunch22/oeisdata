%N A102640 Compute the greatest prime factors (GPFs, A006530()) of j + 2^n for j = 0, 1, ..., L. a(n) is the maximal length L of such a sequence in which the greatest prime factors are increasing with increasing j.
%C A102640 A006530(2^n)=2 is a local minimum. Going either upward or downward with the argument, the greatest prime factors are increasing for a while.
%e A102640 For n = 12: 2^10 = 4096. The greatest prime factors of 4096, 4097, 4098, 4099 are as follows: {2, 241, 683, 4099}. A006530(4100) = 41 is already smaller than A006530(4099). Thus the length of increasing GPF sequence is 4 = a(12).
