%N A102420 Number of partitions of n into exactly k = 5 parts with each part p <= 5.
%C A102420 There are only 26 nonzero terms.
%C A102420 a(n) is also the number of partitions of n-1 into exactly 4 parts with each part p in the range 1 <= p <= 6; i.e. the number of ways of arriving at a total of n-1 with 4 6-sided dice. - _Toby Gottfried_, Feb 19 2009
