%N A102641 Compute the greatest prime factors (GPFs, A006530()) of -j + 2^n for j = 0, 1, ..., L. a(n) is the maximal length L of such a sequence in which the greatest prime factors are increasing with decreasing j.
%C A102641 A006530(2^n)=2 is a local minimum. Going either upward or downward with the argument, the largest prime factors are increasing for a while. Here the maximal length of increasing greatest-prime-factor sequences are given when going downward with the arguments. Compare with A102640.
%e A102641 For n = 12: 2^10 = 4096. The greatest prime factors of 4096, 4095, 4094, 4093 are as follows: {2, 13, 89, 4093}. A006530(4092) = 31 is already smaller than A006530(4093). Thus the length of the increasing GPF sequence is 4 = a(12).
