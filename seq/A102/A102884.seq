%N A102884 a(n) * 6 does not appear in A102883.
%C A102884 Many of these are excluded because the sum of a(n)*6 and its divisors less than or equal to its square root is prime, but not always. a(3) = 18. 18*6 = 108. Adding the divisors less than or equal to the square root of 108 yields 133. 133 is not prime, but shares no common divisor with 108 greater than 1.

%e A102884 a(2) = 14 because 14*6 is 84. The divisors of 84 which are less than or equal to its square root are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7. 84+1+2+3+4+6+7 = 107. GCD(84,107)=1, so 84 is excluded from A102883. Most multiples of 6 are included in A102883, 14*6 is the second multiple to be excluded.
