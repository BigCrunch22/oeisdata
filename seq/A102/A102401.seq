%N A102401 a(n) is the index of the permutation of order n having the least sum of pairwise products as given by A026035.
%C A102401 A026035 gives the minimum sum of products for permutations and was used to validate the results above. There is a companion index for the permutations that are the reversals of those indexed here. A formula would be very welcome.
%e A102401 In the permutation table of order 7 the first instance of a row having the least sum of overlapping pairwise products can be found empirically to be:
%e A102401 6 2 4 3 5 1 7
%e A102401 and this is found at index 3776. Its products are
%e A102401 12 8 12 15 5 7
%e A102401 and sum is 59; a(7) of A026035 is 59. This allows us to give a(7) as 3776.
