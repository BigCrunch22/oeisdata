%N A102352 Numbers n such that n^3 can be partitioned into n primes such that n-1 are consecutive primes and the remaining prime is larger than the sum of the n-1 consecutive primes.
%C A102352 Indices of nonzero terms in A102706.
%C A102352 It appears that this sequence contains all numbers except 1 and 8 - is there a proof?
%e A102352 3 is a member since 3^3 = 27 = 3+5+19, where 3 and 5 are consecutive and 19 > 3+5.
%Y A102352 Cf. A102706.
