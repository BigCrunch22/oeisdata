%N A102241 Hexagrams of the Yi Jing [or I Ching] interpreted in base 10, with the top line = 2^5 (most significant bit) and the bottom line as 2^0 (least significant bit).
%C A102241 Traditionalists insist that the hexagrams were built from trigrams, which were in turn built from single lines. Historians point out that this is not supported by facts, the hexagrams came first and the rest has evolved from commentary.
%C A102241 There are at least 5 orderings: The popular book order (known as the Wen-Wan ordering, this sequence), the MaWangDui order (A125638), the Lian-Shan ordering (partial), the Kuei-Tsan ordering (partial) and the most recent binary ordering, known as the Fu-Hsi ordering (probably by Shao Yung, +1000 most certainly influenced by Yang Hsiung's Tai Hsuan Jing +10).
%C A102241 In a similar vein the Tai-Hsuan Jing (Han Dynasty, Yang Tze-Yun or Yang Hsiung about +10). This book uses four layers of unbroken, broken once and twice-broken lines that result in the numbers 00 - 80 arranged in a base-three number system order. This book may have also influenced Leibniz.
%C A102241 To my knowledge the orderings of the hexagrams have not been explained mathematically (apart from the obvious fact that each hexagram is followed by its binary reversal or binary complement if it is a binary palindrome).
