%N A102167 Lightest finite strictly increasing sequence of integers showing once and only once every pair of digits from [00] to [99]. The "weight" of such a sequence is the sum of all its a(n). Weight of this sequence is 2995.
%C A102167 It seems that it is only a conjecture that this sequence is really the lightest! - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 15 2005
%e A102167 Sequence starts with 7 19 20 23... showing pairs [71], [19], [92], [20], [02], [23]...
