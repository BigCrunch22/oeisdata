%N A102003 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of ordered trees with n edges and having k branches of odd length (n>=0, 0<=k<=n).
%C A102003 Row n has n+1 terms.
%C A102003 Column 0 yields the Catalan numbers (A000108) alternating with 0's.
%C A102003 The diagonal entries are the Motzkin numbers (A001006).
%C A102003 T(n,n-2) = A025566(n) for n>=2.

%F A102003 G.f. G = G(t,z) satisfies z(t+z)G^2-(1+tz)G+1+tz=0.
%e A102003 T(3,3)=2 because we have (i) a tree with 3 edges hanging from the root and (ii) a tree with one edge hanging from the root, at the end of which 2 edges are hanging.
