%N A102805 Let f(n) be the minimal number of distinct nonzero tetrahedral numbers that add to n (or -1 if n is not a sum of distinct tetrahedral numbers); sequence gives numbers n for which f(n) = 6.
%C A102805 It appears that there are just two numbers n for which f(n) = 7, namely 412 and 622 and none with f(n) > 7.
