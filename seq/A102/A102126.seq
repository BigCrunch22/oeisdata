%N A102126 Minimum number of pieces needed to dissect a square into n smaller squares (not necessarily of the same size).
%H A102126 Eric Weisstein et al., <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Dissection.html">Dissection</a>.
%F A102126 a(n) = n for n > 5
%e A102126 For n>1, a(2n) = 2n because a square can be dissected into a square with edge (n-1)/n times the original square and a strip of n and a strip of n-1 squares (each with edge 1/n times the original square). For n>1, a(2n+3)= 2n+3 because one square in the above example can be dissected into four equally sized squares.
