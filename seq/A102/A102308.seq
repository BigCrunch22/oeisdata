%N A102308 If n = product{primes p(k)|n} p(k)^b(n,p(k)), where p(k) is the k-th prime that divides n (when these primes are listed from smallest to largest) and each b(n,p(k)) is a positive integer, then the sequence contains the non-prime-powers n such that p(k)^b(n,p(k)) > p(k+1) for all k, 1<=k<= -1 + number of distinct prime divisors of n.
%e A102308 252 is factored as 2^2 * 3^2 * 7^1. Since 2^2 > 3 and 3^2 > 7, then 252 is in the sequence. On the other hand, 60 is factored as 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^1. Even though 2^2 > 3, 3^1 is not > 5. So 60 is not in the sequence.
