%N A102695 Making the absolute difference between the last two digits of a(n) gives the n-t h digit of the sequence; a(n) < a(n+1).
%e A102695 For n=1, a(n)=10; (1-0)=1 thus 1 is the first digit of sequence.
%e A102695 For n=2, a(n)=11; (1-1)=0 thus 0 is the 2nd digit of sequence.
%e A102695 For n=3, a(n)=12; (2-1)=1 thus 1 is the 3rd digit of sequence.
%e A102695 For n=4, a(n)=21; (2-1)=1 thus 1 is the 4th digit of sequence.
