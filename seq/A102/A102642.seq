%N A102642 a(n) = A102640(n) + A102641(n) - 1.
%C A102642 A006530(2^n)=2 is a local minimum. Actual sequence displays the "width of valley" between the two nearest peaks of largest prime divisors. At the bottom of valley lies the number 2, the minimum.
%e A102642 n=12: 2^10=4096. The greatest prime divisors of numbers around 4096 [both downward and upward] are as follows: {31, 4093, 89, 13, 2, 241, 683, 4099, 41}. The length of relevant sequence, i.e., between peaks 4093 and 4099 is 7, thus a(12)=7.
