%N A102850 Non-monotonic "True so far" sequence: In the first n terms, the digit (a(n) mod 10) occurs floor(a(n)/10) times; a(n) is the smallest such number.
%C A102850 Sequence has 5191475 terms. The numbers of occurrences of digits 0-9 are 3589309, 4812817, 4977431, 4564762, 3741602, 3738734, 3599425, 3599878, 3598956, 3589537.
%C A102850 This sequence first differs from the original "True so far" sequence A102357 at a(351) = 920 because this is the first term that is less than the previous term, 1002.
%C A102850 The sequence is injective (no term appears twice) as consequence of the definition, while this is imposed through monotonicity in A102357. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 18 2019

%e A102850 a(10) = 20 because up to this point there are two 0 digits in the sequence, including the 0 in 20.
%e A102850 a(5191476) doesn't exist. 35893100 would yield a total of 3589311 0's, while 35893110 or 35893120 would yield 3589310 0's. Similar reasons prevent other terms ending with other digits.
