%N A102883 Terms which share a divisor greater than 1 with the value formed by adding them to the sum of their divisors less than or equal to their square roots.
%C A102883 At first glance it appears that all multiples of 6 are included in this sequence, but a number of them are excluded (such as 5*6 and 14*6.) See A102884 for a list of multiples of 6 not included in this sequence.

%e A102883 a(3) = 18 because the divisors of 18 less than or equal to its square root are 1, 2 and 3. 18+1+2+3 = 24 and GCD(18,24) = 6 which is greater than 1. 18 is the third term which satisfies this requirement.
