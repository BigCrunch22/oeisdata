%N A102331 Initial members of quintuplets (p, p+4, p+12, p+16, p+24) of consecutive primes with the corresponding difference pattern:{4,8,4,8}.
%C A102331 Generalization of A022007. These primes are congruent to 7 modulo 10, so the realization of longer prime-difference pattern={4,8,4,8,4} is not already possible because the sum=4+8+4+8+4=28. Consequently, 10k+7+28=10m+5 cannot be a prime. Thus analogous generalization of A022008 is possible only with restrictions. See also Comment in A102335.
%e A102331 n=13147 prime is followed by {13151, 13159, 13163, 13171} primes. Observe that these patterns start and end with primes of 10k+7 and 10m+1 form respectively.
