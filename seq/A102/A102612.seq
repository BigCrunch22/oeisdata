%N A102612 First nonzero terms in the sequences formed by the unique count of primes between an and (a+1)n.
%C A102612 Care should be taken to choose a sufficiently large n for a given m range for a in the script below. (50,1000) -> 22,11,18,62,59,29,12,47,106,40,17,104,94,44,83,22,.. (50,2000) -> 22,11,18,62,59,29,12,47,106,40,17,104,94,44,83,180,.. Notice the breakdown at the end. While the terms in the sequence tend to oscillate increasing, strange things are possible when more terms are listed. Conjecture: The number of terms in this sequence is infinite.
