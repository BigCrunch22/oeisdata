%N A102748 a(n) is the least k such that (2^n)*(10^k) -1 or +1 is prime.
%C A102748 For n even >2 the least prime is of the form (2^n)*(10^k)+1. For n odd >2 the least prime is of the form (2^n)*(10^k)-1 Mersenne-primes are in the sequence with a(n)=0 and n prime.
%e A102748 (2^0)*(10^0)+1 = 2 prime so a(0) = 0.
%e A102748 (2^1)*(10^0)+1 = 3 prime so a(1) = 0.
%e A102748 (2^2)*(10^0)-1 = 3 prime as (2^2)*(10^0)+1 = 5 prime so a(2) = 0.
