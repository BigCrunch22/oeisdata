%N A088492 a(2n+1)=2n+1, a(2n) = floor(2*n/A005185(n)), a weighted inverse of Hofstadter's Q-sequence.
%C A088492 Define a sequence of partial products of Hofstadters Q-sequence, H(n) = prod_{i=1..n} A005185(i) = 1, 1, 2, 6, 18, 72, 360, 1800,.. for n>=1 (which differs from A004395).
%C A088492 The original definition was equivalent to a(n) = [n *H([(n-1)/2])/H([n/2])] where [..] is the floor function.
%C A088492 A consequence of this construction is a(2n+1)=2n+1 at the odd indices. At the even indices, a(2*n) = [2*n*H(n-1)/H(n)] = [2*n/A005185(n)], which is used to simplify the definition.
%C A088492 a(2n)=3 for 8<=n<=48. The first 5 at an even index occurs at a(2*193)=5.
