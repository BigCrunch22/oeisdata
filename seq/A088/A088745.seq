%N A088745 Infinite array read by antidiagonals: for n>=1 let T_n = upper left n X n matrix. Then T_1 = (1), T_n has elements 1..n^2, contains T_{n-1} as n-1 X n-1 upper left submatrix and abs(det(T_n)) is a maximized.
%C A088745 Matrices with elements 1..n^2 that are to have maximum absolute determinant under the following construction. Start with a(1,1)=1, build successive n X n matrices by fixing previous (n-1) X (n-1) matrix and adding matrix elements (n-1)^2+1..n^2 on lower and right border of matrix. Determinants of upper left n X n matrices are: {1, -10, 205, -6300, 276363, -15615642, ...}.
%C A088745 The definition is incomplete since it does not say what to do if there are several possibilities for the new border. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Oct 18 2003
%C A088745 Terms computed by Hugo Pfoertner (see link). If we start with either 2 X 2 matrices [1,3][4,2] or [1,4][3,2], initially there seems to be a unique solution for the subsequent enhanced matrices.
