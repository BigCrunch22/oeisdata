%N A088458 a(n) equals the number of partial quotients of the simple continued fraction expansion of the nonsimple continued fraction: 1/(1+2/(2+3/(3+...+n/n)))).
%C A088458 The finite nonsimple continued fraction, 1/(1+2/(2+3/(3+...+n/n)))), as n grows, has the limit: 1/(e-1) = [0;1,1,2,1,1,4,1,1,6,...] (A005131).
%e A088458 a(5)=7 since there are 7 partial quotients in the resultant simple continued fraction of 1/(1+2/(2+3/(3+4/(4+5/5)))) = 53/91 = [0;1,1,2,1,1,7].
%e A088458 The count of partial quotients includes the initial integer position.
