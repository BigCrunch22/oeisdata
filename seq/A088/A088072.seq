%N A088072 Numbers sandwiched between two numbers having only one prime divisor (at least) one of which is composite.
%C A088072 Terms of A088071 which are not terms of A014574 (average of twin prime pairs).
%C A088072 Conjecture (1): Sequence is infinite. Conjecture (2): There are only finitely many terms which are sandwiched between composite numbers (26 is the only such term below 1000000).
