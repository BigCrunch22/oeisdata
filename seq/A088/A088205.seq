%N A088205 Infinite audioactive word that shifts 1 place left under "Look and Say" method A, starting with a(0)=0.
%C A088205 Positions of zero are given by A088206.
%C A088205 The sequence is obtained by starting with 0 and then successively appending the count (number of repetitions) and the value which is seen, term after term: "one zero, one one, one zero, three ones, one zero, ...". Otherwise said, the sequence is defined by "Start with 0 and append the result of "Look and Say" applied to the sequence". The "shifted left under Look and Say" property is thus an immediate consequence of the definition. A less trivial property is that there cannot be a number larger than 3 in this sequence. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 28 2015
%e A088205 The initial terms {0,1,0,1,1,1,0,3,1,1,0,...} are shifted 1 place left by saying: "one 0, one 1, one 0, three 1's, one 0, ...", which drops the leading 0 to give {1,0,1,1,1,0,3,1,1,0,...}.
