%N A088330 Sum of the remainders when n is divided by nonzero numbers obtained by deleting one digit. The sum ranges over all the digits.
%C A088330 a((10^n - 1)/9) = n. for n > 2. a(1111111 n times ) = a(A000042(n)) = n, n > 2.
%C A088330 Differs from A067458 first at n=101, where A067458(101)=0 and a(101) = (101 mod 1) + (101 mod 11) + (101 mod 10)=0+2+1=3. [_R. J. Mathar_, Sep 11 2008]
%e A088330 a(1234) = Rem[1234/123] + Rem[1234/124]+ Rem[1234/134] + Rem[1234/234] = 4+ 118 + 28 + 64 = 214 where Rem [a/b] = the remainder when a is divided by b.
