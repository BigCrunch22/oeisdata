%e A088959 Squares 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, and 4^2 have 0 representations as the sum of two distinct positive squares. (Thus, A088111(1) = 0 for the number of representations of 1^2.) Thus a(1) = 1.
%e A088959 Square 5^2 can be written as 3^2 + 4^2 only (here A088111(2) = 1). Thus, a(2) = 5.
%e A088959 Looking at sequence A046080, we see that for 5 <= n <= 24, only n^2 = 5^2, 10^2, 13^2, 15^2, 17^2, 20^2 can be written as a sum of two distinct positive squares (in a single way) because 5^2 = 3^2 + 4^2, 10^2 = 6^2 + 8^2, 13^2 = 5^2 + 12^2, 17^2 = 8^2 + 15^2, and 20^2 = 12^2 + 16^2.
%e A088959 Since A046080(25) = 2 and A088111(3) = 2, we have that 25^2 can be written as a sum of two distinct positive squares in two ways. Indeed, 25^2 = 7^2 + 24^2 = 15^2 + 20^2. Thus, a(3) = 25.
%e A088959 For 26 <= n <= 64, we see from sequence A046080 that n^2 cannot be written in more than 2 ways as a sum of two distinct positive squares.
%e A088959 Since A046080(65) = 4, we see that 65^2 can be written as the sum of two distinct positive squares in 4 ways. Indeed, 65^2 = 16^2 + 63^2 = 25^2 + 60^2 = 33^2 + 56^2 = 39^2 + 52^2. Thus, a(4) = 65.
