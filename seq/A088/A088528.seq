%N A088528 Let m = number of ways of partitioning n into parts using all the parts of a subset of {1, 2, ..., n-1} whose sum of all parts of a subset is less than n; a(n) gives number of different subsets of {1, 2, ..., n-1} whose m is 0.
%C A088528 Note that {2, 3} is counted for n = 6 because although 6 = 2+2+2 = 3+3, there is no partition that includes both 2 and 3. - _David Wasserman_, Aug 09 2005
%e A088528 a(5)=3 because there are three different subsets, {2}, {3} & {4}; a(6)=3 because there are three different subsets, {4}, {5} & {2,3}.
