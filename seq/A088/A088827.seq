%F A088827 Conjecture: a(n) = ((2*r) + 1)^2 * 2^(c+1) where r and c are the corresponding row and column of n in the table format of A191432, where the first row and column are 0. - _John Tyler Rascoe_, Jul 12 2022
%e A088827 From _Michael De Vlieger_, May 14 2017: (Start)
%e A088827 4 is a term since it is even and the sum of its divisors {1,2,4} = 7 - 2(4) = -1 is odd. It is an even square.
%e A088827 18 is a term since it is even and the sum of its divisors {1,2,3,6,9,18} = 39 - 2(18) = 3 is odd. It is 2 times a square, i.e., 2(9). (End)
