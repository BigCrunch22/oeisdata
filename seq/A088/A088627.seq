%N A088627 Let 2n = r*s. Then a(n) = number of primes of the form r+s (r= 1 and s = 2n contributes 1 to the count if 2n+1 is prime).
%C A088627 Only even numbers yield primes hence odd numbers are not considered.
%C A088627 There is an upper bound: if n has only k different prime divisors > 2, then a(n) <= 2^k. - _Matthias Engelhardt_, Jan 05 2004
