%N A088883 Primes which when concatenated with their reverse and incremented by 2 yield a new prime.
%C A088883 It appears that if concat(p,reverse(p))+2 is prime, then concat(p,reverse(p))-2 is not and vice versa. This was tested for the first 60000 primes.

%e A088883 a(4) =109 because (i) 109 is prime and (ii) when 109 is concatenated with its reverse (901) + 2, the result (109903) is prime.
