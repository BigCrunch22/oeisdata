%C A088847 Note that A087979(n) is a balanced number (A020492), hence this sequence is well-defined. - _Max Alekseyev_, Oct 10 2024
%C A088847 For all n, a(n) <= n and a(n) divides A299822(n). - _Max Alekseyev_, Oct 11 2024
%e A088847 While A088830 includes special balanced numbers, A087979 does not include per definition. Nevertheless, it seems that A087979 consists only of balanced numbers. This is provable at least for special cases.
