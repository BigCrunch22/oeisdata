%N A088519 2-Golomb's sequence G(n,2): earliest positive increasing sequence starting with (1,2) and satisfying "length of n-th run = n-th partial sum".
%C A088519 Alternative definition: if A(n)=a(1)+...+a(n), (a(n))n>=1 satisfies a(1)=1, a(2)=2 and for A(1)+...+A(n-1)<m<=A(1)+...+A(n) a(m)=n.
%C A088519 Alternative description: unique positive increasing sequence (a(n))n>=1 starting with (1,2) and such that the sequence of second differences of the function "rank of the last occurrence of m in (a(n))n>=1" is (a(n))n>=1 itself.
%C A088519 Sequence has same kind of asymptotic behavior as Golomb's sequence.
%C A088519 Sequence is case k=2 of the following possible generalization of Golomb's sequence, say k-Golomb's sequence G(n,k). Let S(n,0)=G(n,k) and S(n,k) = Sum_{i=1..n} S(i,k-1) the sequence G(n,k) such that G(1,k)=1, G(2,k)=2 and "length of n-th run = S(n,k-1)" is asymptotic to r(k)*n^s(k) where s(k)=(-k+sqrt(k^2+4))/2 and r(k) = (Product_{i=0..k-1} (1/s(k)-i))^(s(k)/(1+s(k))). Golomb's sequence is obtained for k=1. Alternative description: the sequence of k-th differences of the function "rank of the last occurrence of m in (G(n,k))n>=1" is (G(n,k))n>=1 itself.
%F A088519 a(n) is asymptotic to (2+sqrt(2))^(1/(2+sqrt(2)))*n^(sqrt(2)-1);
%F A088519 conjecture: a(n) = (2+sqrt(2))^(1/(2+sqrt(2)))*n^(sqrt(2)-1) + O(1).
%e A088519 a(1) + a(2) + a(3) = 1+2+2 = 5, hence the third run has length 5 and consists of 5 3's.
