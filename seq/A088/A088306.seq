%N A088306 Integers n with tan n > |n|, ordered by |n|.
%C A088306 Name was "Positive integers n with |tan n| > n." before signs were added. The sign here shows whether tan(|n|) is positive or negative.
%C A088306 That this sequence is infinite was proved by Bellamy, Lagarias and Lazebnik. It seems not to be known whether there are infinitely many n with tan n > n.
%C A088306 At approximately 2.37e154, there is a value of n which has tan(n)/n > 556. - _Phil Carmody_, Mar 04 2007 [This is index 214 in the b-file.]
%C A088306 As n increases, log(|a(n)|)/n seems to approach Pi/2; this is similar to what would be expected if an integer sequence were created by drawing many random numbers independently from a uniform distribution on the interval [-Pi/2,+Pi/2] and including in the sequence only those integers j for which the j-th random number x_j happened to satisfy |x_j| < 1/j (and applying to j the sign of x_j). - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Aug 19 2014; updated Nov 07 2014 to reflect the change in the sequence's Name)
