%C A088251 The n-th row of the following triangle contains smallest set of n primes which form n successive terms of an arithmetic progression from the 2nd to (n+1)th term with the first term 1. 2 2 3 3 5 7 331 661 991 1321 ... Sequence contains the first column.
%C A088251 Conjecture: (1) Sequence is infinite. (2) For every n there are infinitely many arithmetic progressions with n successive primes.
%C A088251 Minimal primes p beginning a chain of n primes in an arithmetic progression of common difference  p-1. - _Robin Garcia_, Jun 22 2013
%C A088251 Least prime p such that pi = i*p-i+1 is prime for i = 2 to i = n. - _Robin Garcia_, Jun 22 2013
%C A088251 a(n) is 1 mod 10 for n > 3 because if p is 3 mod 10, then all (2+5*t)*p -(1+5*t) for t=0,1,2,... are 5 mod 10; if p is 7 mod 10, all (4+5*t)*p -(3+5*t) are 5 mod 10 for t=0,1,2...;  if p is 9 mod 10, all (3+5*t)*p - (2+5*t) are 5 mod 10 for t=0,1,2... - _Robin Garcia_, Jun 22 2013
