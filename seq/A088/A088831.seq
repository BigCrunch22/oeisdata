%N A088831 Numbers k whose abundance is 2: sigma(k) - 2k = 2.
%C A088831 A subset of A045768.
%C A088831 If 2^k-3 is prime (k is a term of A050414) then 2^(k-1)*(2^k-3) is in the sequence; this fact is a result of the following interesting theorem that I have found. Theorem: If j is an integer and 2^k-(2j+1) is prime then 2^(k-1)*(2^k-(2j+1)) is a solution of the equation sigma(x)=2(x+j). - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Feb 23 2005
%C A088831 Note that the fact "if 2^p-1 is prime then 2^(p-1)*(2^p-1) is a perfect number" is also a trivial result of this theorem. All known terms of this sequence are of the form 2^(k-1)*(2^k-3) where 2^k-3 is prime. Conjecture: There are no terms of other forms. So the next terms of this sequence are likely 549754241024, 8796086730752, 140737463189504, 144115187270549504, 2^93*(2^94-3), 2^115*(2^116-3), 2^121*(2^122-3), 2^149*(2^150-3), etc. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Feb 23 2005
%C A088831 The conjecture in the previous comment is incorrect. The first counterexample is 650, which has factorization 2*5^2*13. - _T. D. Noe_, May 10 2010
%C A088831 a(11) > 10^12. - _Donovan Johnson_, Dec 08 2011
%C A088831 a(12) > 10^13. - _Giovanni Resta_, Mar 29 2013
%C A088831 a(14) > 10^18. - _Hiroaki Yamanouchi_, Aug 23 2018
%C A088831 Any term x of this sequence can be combined with any term y of A191363 to satisfy the property (sigma(x)+sigma(y))/(x+y) = 2, which is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for two numbers to be amicable. - _Timothy L. Tiffin_, Sep 13 2016
%C A088831 Is there any odd term in this sequence? - _Jenaro Tomaszewski_, Jan 06 2021
%C A088831 If there exists any odd term in this sequence, it must be weird, so it must exceed 10^28. - _Alexander Violette_, Jan 02 2022
