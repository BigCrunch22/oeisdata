%N A088574 Representative lunar primes.
%C A088574 Let P = ...9..9ij...kl9...9... be a lunar prime (A087097), where the digits ij...kl are a typical string of consecutive digits that are not 9. Any number Q obtained from P by replacing ij...kl by other non-9-ish digits with the same order relationship as ij...kl is also prime. Sequence gives lexicographically earliest member of each such equivalence class.
%C A088574 It is necessary to consider order relations of all non-9 digits, not just consecutive ones. For example, 9091 is prime, but 9491 = 91*949. - _David Wasserman_, Aug 11 2005
