%N A088276 Smallest k such that 10^k + r is a prime ending (least significant digits) in r where r is the n-th odd number not divisible by 5. 0 if no such number exists.
%C A088276 Conjecture: (1) The only zero entries are for values of r == 2 (mod 3). (2) There are infinitely many values of k such that 10^k + r is a prime if r is not == 2 (mod 3).
%e A088276 The term corresponding to 21 is 3 as 21, 121 both are composite and 1021 is a prime. 1021 = 10^3 + 21 hence k = 3.
