%N A136561 Triangle read by rows: n-th diagonal (from the right) is the sequence of (signed) differences between pairs of consecutive terms in the (n-1)th diagonal. The rightmost diagonal (A136562) is defined: A136562(1)=1; A136562(n) is the smallest integer > A136562(n-1) such that any (signed) integer occurs at most once in the triangle A136561.
%C A136561 Requiring that the absolute values of the differences in the difference triangle only occur at most once each leads to the Zorach additive triangle. (See A035312.)
%e A136561 The triangle begins:
%e A136561 1,
%e A136561 2,3,
%e A136561 4,6,9,
%e A136561 -5,-1,5,14,
%e A136561 13,8,7,12,26,
%e A136561 -30,-17,-9,-2,10,36.
%e A136561 Example:
%e A136561 Considering the rightmost value of the 4th row: Writing a 10 here instead, the first 4 rows of the triangle become:
%e A136561 1
%e A136561 2,3
%e A136561 4,6,9
%e A136561 -9,-5,1,10
%e A136561 But 1 already occurs earlier in the triangle. So 10 is not the rightmost element of row 4.
%e A136561 Checking 11,12,13,14; 14 is the smallest value that can be the rightmost element of row 4 and not have any elements of row 4 occur earlier in the triangle.
