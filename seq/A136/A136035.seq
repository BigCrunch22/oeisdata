%N A136035 Remainder when dividing 2^q - 1 by q + 1 where q is the n-th prime.
%C A136035 The Feit-Thompson conjecture states that given primes p and q, (p^q - 1)/(p - 1) is never divisible by (q^p - 1)/(q - 1). Assigning p = 2, the two expressions simplify to 2^q - 1 and q + 1. The former is an odd number and the latter is even, therefore there will always be a remainder when dividing the former by the latter (with the obvious exception of q = 2). This means that any counterexample to the Feit-Thompson conjecture would have to be a pair of odd primes.

%e A136035 a(7) = 13 because the 7th prime is 17. (2^17 - 1)/(2 - 1) gives the Mersenne prime 131071, which when divided by (17^2 - 1)/(17 - 1) = 18, leaves a remainder of 13.
