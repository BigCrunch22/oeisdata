%N A136300 Numerator of ratio (the denominator being (n-1)!^2 = A001044(n-1)) giving the probability that the last of n persons drawing names randomly from a set of names draws their own, given that each person previously has drawn in succession and did not keep their own name. (Probability of derangements when allocated / rejected sequentially.)
%C A136300 In "Secret Santa", if a person picks their own name, they pick another name and they throw their own name back in. If the last person draws their own name, there's a problem. What is that probability as a function of the number of people participating?

%F A136300 Sum of H(i, N-2) * X(i, N-2) for i=0..2^(N-3), N is the number of people and H(r,c) = sum of H(T(r),L(r)+j) * M(c-T(r)-1,j) for j = 0..c-L(r)-1 and X(r,c) = product of (3 + k - b(r,k)) for k = 0..(c-2) and M(y,z) = binomial distribution (y,z) when y - 1 > z and (y,z)-1 when (y-1)<=z and b(r,k) = bit k of r in base 2 and T(r) = A053645 and L(r) = A000523.
%F A136300 a(n) = (n-1)!*A102262(n)/A102263(n) for n > 1.
%e A136300 If there is one person, the chance of the last person getting their own name is 100%, or 1 over 0!^2. For 2 people, it is 0 / 1!^2. For 3 people, it is 1 / 2!^2, creating a more interesting case. The possible drawings are {2,1,3}, {2,3,1} and {3,1,2}. All other drawings can't happen because the name is rejected and redrawn. But these 3 outcomes don't have equal probability, rather, they are 25%, 25% and 50% respectively. The first outcome is the only one in which the last person draws their own name. The first person has a 50% chance of drawing a 2 or 3. If 2, the second person has a 50% chance of drawing 1 or 3, for a total outcome probability of 1/4. Similarly with 4 people, the chance is 5/36, followed by 76/576 for 5 people, etc. For the case of 5 people, the above equations boil down to this end calculation: {1,5,2,1} * {12,8,9,6} summed, or 12 + 40 + 18 + 6 = 76.
