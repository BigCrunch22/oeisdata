%N A136868 Table read by antidiagonals: T(n,k) is the number of connected directed multigraphs with loops with n arcs and k vertices, which are transitive (the existence of a path between two points implies the existence of an arc between those two points).
%C A136868 Partial sums of the rows of A139624, i.e., T(n,k) = sum(T139624(n,p),p=0..k).
%C A136868 T(0,k) = 1 for k>=0; T(n,0) = 0 and T(n,1) = 1 for n>0.
%C A136868 If k>=n+1, T(n,k) = A139629(n).
