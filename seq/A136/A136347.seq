%N A136347 a(1)=1. Let m be the number of terms in the longest run of consecutive equal terms from among the first n terms of the sequence. a(n+1) = the number of terms, from among the first n terms of the sequence, that are coprime to m.

%e A136347 Among the first 30 terms of the sequence the run of seven 3's (from a(23) to a(29)) is the longest run of consecutive equal terms. (So m = 7.) Among the first 30 terms of the sequence, all 30 terms are coprime to 7. So a(31) = 30.
