%C A136859 Are the formulas conjectured or proved? For example, the analogous sequence for {0,1,2,4} contains the sporadic solution 1010000104010000101. Clearly, if a(n) is in the sequence then 10*a(n) is also in the sequence. Is there any term that is not 0, 1, or 4 times a power of 10? - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 26 2016
%C A136859 Answer: the formulas were merely conjectures. It appears that it is an open question as to whether there is any other type of term. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 29 2016
%C A136859 _David W. Wilson_ has observed that the real number n = 2/3 = 0.66666... with n^2 = 4/9 = 0.44444... (almost) satisfies the requirement of this sequence. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 30 2016

%F A136859 Conjectures from _Philippe DelÃ©ham_, Mar 11 2014: (Start)
%F A136859 G.f.: x^2*(1+4*x)/(1-10*x^2);
%F A136859 a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(3) = 4, a(n) = 10*a(n-2) for n>3. (End)
%F A136859 This yields: a(n) = 4^(n mod 2)*A178501(floor(n/2)), where A178501(n) = floor(10^(k-1)). - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 09 2017
