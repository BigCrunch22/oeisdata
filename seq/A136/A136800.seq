%N A136800 Number of composites in prime gaps of size 3 or larger, in order of appearance.
%C A136800 The sequence counts the terms in the runs of composites associated with A136798-A136799.
%C A136800 A129856 is obtained by removing the composites (9, 15 etc.) from this sequence.
%C A136800 This is sequence A046933, with the zero and all the 1's deleted. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jan 24 2008
%F A136800 a(n)=A136799(n)-A136798(n)+1.
%e A136800 a(1)=3 because in the run 8, 9, 10 there are three terms.
