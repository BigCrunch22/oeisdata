%N A136348 a(1)=1. Let m be the number of terms in the longest run of consecutive equal terms from among the first n terms of the sequence. a(n+1) = the number of terms, from among the first n terms of the sequence, that divide m.

%e A136348 Among the first 20 terms of the sequence the run of five 3's (from a(11) to a(15)) is the longest run of consecutive equal terms. (So m = 5.) Among the first 20 terms of the sequence, there are six which divide 5. (a(1),a(2),a(7),a(8),a(9),a(10)) So a(21) = 6.
