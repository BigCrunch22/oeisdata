%e A136165 The divisors of 28 are 1,2,4,7,14,28. Among adjacent pairs of divisors, 1 and 2 are coprime and 4 and 7 are coprime. But 2 and 4 are adjacent divisors which are not coprime. And 7 is next to 14 among divisors of 28 and 7 and 14 are not coprime. Therefore there is a(28) = 1 divisor (1) that is not next to another divisor that it is not coprime to.
