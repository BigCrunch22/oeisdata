%N A136023 The largest prime factor among all composites <= 10^n.
%C A136023 This is the largest single divisor contributing to A136021(n).
%C A136023 If 4 concatenated with n-1 nines is prime, it will be the largest factor. This candidate does not work for n=6 because 499999 is not prime.
%H A136023 Robert Israel, <a href="/A136023/b136023.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..501</a>
%e A136023 a(3)=499 because it is the largest prime factor of all k<=10^3; the largest k in that interval with this factor is k=2*499 = 998.
