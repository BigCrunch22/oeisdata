%N A136107 Number of representations of n as the difference of two positive triangular numbers.
%C A136107 a(n) is also the number of partitions of n into consecutive parts greater than 1. - _Omar E. Pol_, Feb 07 2022
%C A136107 a(n) is the number of solutions of the equations 2(x-1)y-(x-3)x=2(n+1) for 0<x<=y, x-values in A351284; y-values in A351285. Also the number of times n+1 appears in A351153. - _Stefano Spezia_, Feb 12 2022
%C A136107 Equivalence with _Stefano Spezia_ solutions: The equation 2(x-1)y-(x-3)x=2(n+1) can be rewritten (y+1-x/2)(x+1)=n; proof by solving both for y. So solutions factorize n, and since x+1 must be an integer and y+1-x/2 must be an integer, x must be even. So (x+1)|n means we are looking for odd divisors of n, which is the A001227 term of the Alekseyev formula. The correction by A010054 in the Alekseyev formula means: if n is a triangular number, the solution x=y+1 where x>y is not counted by Spezia. - _R. J. Mathar_, Feb 12 2022

%e A136107 a(2) = 1 because 3 - 1 = 2,
%e A136107 a(5) = 2 because 6 - 1 = 15 - 10 = 5,
%e A136107 a(9) = 3 because 10 - 1 = 15 - 6 = 45 - 36 = 9, etc.
%e A136107 For n = 21 the four partitions of 21 into consecutive parts are [21], [11, 10], [8, 7, 6] and [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]. The last partition contains 1 as a part, hence there are only three partitions of 21 into consecutive parts whose parts are greater than 1, so a(21) = 3. - _Omar E. Pol_, Feb 07 2022
