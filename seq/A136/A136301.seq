%N A136301 Frequency of occurrence for each possible "probability of derangement" for a Secret Santa drawing in which each person draws a name in sequence and the only person who does not draw someone else's name is the one who draws the final name.
%C A136301 The sequence is best represented as a series of columns 1..n, where each column j has 2^(j-1) rows (see Example). For more details, see A136300.
%C A136301 The first column represents the case for 3 people (offset 3).

%e A136301 If there are 5 people, numbered 1-5 according to the order in which they draw a name, and person #5 draws name #5, the first four people must draw 1-4 as a proper derangement, and there are 9 ways of doing so: 21435 / 23415 / 24135 / 31425 / 34125 / 34215 / 41235 / 43125 / 43215.
%e A136301 But the probability of each derangement depends on how many choices exist at each successive draw. The first person can draw from 4 possibilities (2,3,4,5). The second person nominally has 3 to choose from, unless the first person drew number 2, in which case person 2 may draw 4 possibilities (1,3,4,5), and so on. The probabilities of 21435 and 24135 are both then
%e A136301         1/4 * 1/4 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/64.
%e A136301 More generally, if there are n people, at the i-th turn (i = 1..n), person i has either (n-i) or (n-i+1) choices, depending on whether the name of the person who is drawing has been chosen yet. A way to represent the two cases above is 01010, where a 0 indicates that the person's number is not yet drawn, and a 1 indicates it is.
%e A136301 For the n-th person to be forced to choose his or her own name, the last digit of this pattern must be 0, by definition. Similarly, the 1st digit must be a 0, and the second to last digit must be a 1. So all the problem patterns start with 0 and end with 10. For 5 people, that leaves 4 target patterns which cover all 9 derangements. By enumeration, that distribution can be shown to be (for the 3rd column = 5 person case):
