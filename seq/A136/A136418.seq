%N A136418 Smallest order of the cyclotomic polynomial whose maximal coefficient in absolute value is n.
%C A136418 This differs from A013594.
%C A136418 For squarefree k, are there an infinite number of cyclotomic polynomials Phi(k,x) of height n? This is true for n=1 because it is known that there are an infinite number of flat cyclotomic polynomials with k the product of three distinct primes. See A117223. - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 22 2008
%C A136418 There are an infinite number of cyclotomic polynomials of height n if the following generalization of Kaplan's theorem 2 is true: Let N be the product of distinct odd primes and let p be one of those primes. Let q any prime such that q = p (mod N/p), then the height of Phi(Nq/p,x) is the same as the height of Phi(N,x). By Dirichlet's theorem, there are an infinite number of primes q. [From _T. D. Noe_, Apr 13 2010]
