%N A136627 For every number n in Ulam's spiral the sequence gives the number of primes around it (number n included).
%C A136627 In Ulam's lattice there are 8 numbers around any number. The sequence is similar to A136626 with an increment of 1 for any prime position.
%e A136627 Numbers around 13 are 3, 12, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 14 -> 3, 29, 31 and 13 itself are primes, so a(13)=4.
