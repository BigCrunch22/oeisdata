%N A136239 Forced end points ( -Infinity ->-1) integration of A137286: Triangle of coefficients of Integrated recursive orthogonal Hermite polynomials given in Hochstadt's book : P(x, n) = x*P(x, n - 1) - n*P(x, n - 2).
%C A136239 Because of error functions in the result where constants should be this is a difficult calculation.
%C A136239 Probably the wrong approach, but it is my best effort at getting Gaussian normal type functions to give integers. There has got to be a better way than this: maybe a conformal transform of the known Chebyshev Integration polynomials?
%C A136239 No recurrence formula was found for these polynomials, so they are probably wrong.

%F A136239 P(x, n) = x*P(x, n - 1) - n*P(x, n - 2); L(x,n)=Integrate[Exp[y^2/4]*p(y,n-1),{y,-Infinity,x}]/(-2*Exp[ -x^2/4]) Here the weight function is taken as the square root of the Hermite weight function Exp[ -x^2/2] and then divided out of the end result.
