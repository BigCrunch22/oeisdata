%N A136244 Least positive integer k such that 2k can be expressed as the sum of two primes in exactly n ways.
%C A136244 It appears that 2, 3, 4, 6 are the only numbers k such that 2k can be expressed as the sum of two primes in only one way.
%C A136244 Except when n = 1, a(n) = A258713(n). The first 11 terms of this sequence are the same as the initial terms of A053033. If a(n) exists for all n then A053033 is a subsequence. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Jan 28 2020

%F A136244 a(n) = A023036(n) / 2.
%F A136244 A045917(a(n)) = n. (End)
%e A136244 a(3) = 11: 22 = 3 + 19 = 5 + 17 = 11 + 11. Also 22 is the least number which could be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers in exactly three ways.
