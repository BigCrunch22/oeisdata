%N A136167 a(n) = the number of divisors of n that are each not coprime to any adjacent (previous or following) divisor of n.

%e A136167 The divisors of 28 are 1,2,4,7,14,28. Among adjacent pairs of divisors, 1 and 2 are coprime and 4 and 7 are coprime. Therefore there are a(28) =2 divisors that are each not next to any divisor they are coprime to. (These two divisors are 14 and 28.)
