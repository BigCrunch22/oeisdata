%N A305534 Index of the smallest prime in the n-Fibonacci sequence, or the Lucas U(n,-1) sequence.
%C A305534 Smallest k such that the k-th Fibonacci polynomial evaluated at x=n is prime. (The first few Fibonacci polynomials are 1, x, x^2 + 1, x^3 + 2*x, x^4 + 3*x^2 + 1, x^5 + 4*x^3 + 3*x, ...)
%C A305534 All terms are primes, since if a divides b, then the a-th term of the n-Fibonacci sequence also divides the b-th term of the n-Fibonacci sequence.
%C A305534 Corresponding primes are 2, 2, 3, 17, 5, 37, 7, 4289, 726120289954448054047428229, 101, 11, 21169, 13, 197, 82088569942721142820383601, 257, 17, 34539049, 19, 401, ...
%C A305534 a(n) = 2 if and only if n is prime.
%C A305534 a(n) = 3 if and only if n^2 + 1 is prime (A005574), except n=2 (since 2 is the only prime p such that p^2 + 1 is also prime).
%C A305534 a(34) > 1024, does a(n) exist for all n >= 1? (However, 17 is the only prime in the first 1024 terms of the 4-Fibonacci sequence, and it seems that 17 is the only prime in the 4-Fibonacci sequence.)
%C A305534 a(35)..a(48) = 71, 3, 2, 17, 11, 3, 2, 37, 2, 31, 5, 11, 2, 5, a(50)..a(54) = 11, 11, 23, 2, 3, a(56) = 3, a(58)..a(75) = 5, 2, 47, 2, 5, 311, 13, 233, 3, 2, 5, 11, 5, 2, 7, 2, 3, 5. Unknown terms a(34), a(49), a(55), a(57), exceed 1024, if they exist.
%C A305534 a(49) > 20000, if it exists. - _Giovanni Resta_, Jun 06 2018
