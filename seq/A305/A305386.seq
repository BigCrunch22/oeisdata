%N A305386 Indicator function of A140101.
%C A305386 a(n) = 1 iff n is in A140101.
%C A305386 This sequence is "Tribonacci-automatic"; there is a 14-state automaton that takes the Tribonacci representation of n as input and accepts if and only if a(n) = 1. - _Jeffrey Shallit_, Oct 05 2022
%C A305386 This sequence is given by deleting the 2s in the Tribonacci word A080843 - _Daniel Rust_, Feb 28 2023
