%N A305374 First differences of A140101.
%C A305374 Or, prefix A276788 with a 1 and then add 1 to every term.
%C A305374 This relation between A003144 and A140101 is a conjecture (Daniel Forgues remarks would trivially follow from this relation). - _Michel Dekking_, Mar 18 2019
%C A305374 The lengths of the successive runs of 3's are given by A275925.
%C A305374 a(n) seems to take only the values 2 or 3, where {a(n), a(n+1)} may be {3, 2} or {2, 3} or {3, 3}, but not {2, 2}. The second differences of A140101 (first differences of this sequence) thus seem to take only the values -1 or 0 or 1. - _Daniel Forgues_, Aug 19 2018
%C A305374 Conjecture: This sequence is 2.TTW(3,3,2) where TTW is the ternary tribonacci word defined in A080843, or equally it is THETA(3,3,2), where THETA is defined in A275925. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 19 2019
%C A305374 All these conjectures are now theorems - see the Dekking et al. paper. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jul 22 2019
