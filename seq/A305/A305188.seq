%N A305188 Numbers that are equal to a nontrivial multinomial coefficient (i.e., equal to k!/(k1!*...*km!) with k1 + ... + km = k, k-2 >= k1 >= ... >= km).
%C A305188 This sequence answers the following question: what numbers correspond to the number of permutations of a number of items that is lower than the number of permutations itself? It means that the underlying structure has some form of redundance / symmetry.
%C A305188 It can be shown that:
%C A305188 - no prime number is part of this sequence (see A304938)
%C A305188 - some nonprimes are not part of the sequence (beginning with 1, 4, 8, 9, 14, 16, 18, ...)
%C A305188 - any number that is a factorial of another integer e is part of this sequence (k=e, k1=ki=...=ke=1).
%C A305188 This sequence is a generalization of A006987.

%C A305188 Also the numbers that are the number of permutations of either:
%C A305188 - sets of balls with two distinct colors of balls where each color occurs at least twice;
%C A305188 - sets of balls with at least three distinct colors of balls.

%C A305188 The asymptotic density of this sequence is 0 (Niven, 1951).
%C A305188 The number of terms not exceeding x is (1 + sqrt(2)) * x^(1/2) + o(x^(1/2)) (Erdős, 1954). (End)

%e A305188 a(1) = 6 because all numbers lower than 6 are either prime or a power of primes.
%e A305188 105 is a term of the sequence because 105 is equal to a multinomial coefficient: 105 = (4+2+1)! / (4! * 2! * 1!) and 105 is the number of ways 7 balls can be sorted where 4 are red, 2 are yellow and one is blue.
%e A305188 2016 is a term because 64! / (62! * 2!) = 2016. - _David A. Corneth_, May 29 2018
