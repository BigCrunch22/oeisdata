%N A305371 The binary expansions of b(n+1) and b(n) are required to have 1's in common at exactly the positions where a(n) has a 1 in its binary expansion, where b() is A305369.
%C A305371 The definition here is a consequence (or restatement) of the definition of A305369. The connection with A109812 is at present only an empirical observation.

%F A305371 Empirical: For k >= 0, a(4k+1)=1, a(4k+3)=0; for k >= 1, a(2k)=2*A109812(k).
%e A305371 a(8) = 6 = 110_2, which expresses the fact that A305369(8) = 6 = 110_2 and A303369(9) = 7 = 111_2 have binary expensions whose common 1's are 110_2.
