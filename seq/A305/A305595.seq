%C A305595 Two words are considered identical in the cyclic sense if one is a cyclic shift of the other.
%C A305595 An abelian cube is a word of the form x x' x'' where x' and x'' are permutations of x.
%e A305595 For n = 4 the a(4) = 15 such words are {0011, 0012, 0021, 0022, 0101, 0102, 0112, 0121, 0122, 0202, 0211, 0212, 0221, 1122, 1212}.
