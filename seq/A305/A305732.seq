%N A305732 Heinz numbers of reducible integer partitions. Numbers n > 1 that are prime or whose prime indices are relatively prime and such that A181819(n) is already in the sequence.
%C A305732 The Heinz number of an integer partition (y_1,...,y_k) is prime(y_1)*...*prime(y_k). A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. A multiset m whose distinct elements are m_1, m_2, ..., m_k with multiplicities y_1, y_2, ..., y_k is reducible if either m is of size 1 or gcd(m_1,...,m_k) = 1 and the multiset {y_1,...,y_k} is also reducible.
%e A305732 60 has relatively prime prime indices {1,1,2,3} with multiplicities {1,1,2} corresponding to A181819(90) = 12. 12 has relatively prime prime indices {1,1,2} with multiplicities {1,2} corresponding to A181819(12) = 6. 6 has relatively prime prime indices {1,2} with multiplicities {1,1} corresponding to A181819(6) = 4. 4 has relatively prime prime indices {1,1} with multiplicities {2} corresponding to A181819(4) = 3. 3 is prime, so we conclude that 60 belongs to the sequence.
