%N A305473 Let k be a SierpiÅ„ski or Riesel number divisible by 2*n - 1, and let p be the largest number in a set of primes which cover every number of the form k*2^m + 1 (or of the form k*2^m - 1) with m >= 1. a(n) = p if and only if there exists no number k that has a covering set with largest prime < p.
%C A305473 R. G. Stanton found that a(2) = 257.
%C A305473 a(n) >= 73 for any n, see [Stanton].
%C A305473 There exist infinitely many Riesel numbers that are divisible by 15. The number 334437671621489828385689959795356586832846847109919809460835 is one such number.
