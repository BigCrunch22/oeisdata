%N A305821 a(n) = 1 if n is composite and its binary expansion encodes an irreducible (0,1)-polynomial when factored over Q, 0 otherwise.
%C A305821 Characteristic function for A206075, apart from its initial term.

%e A305821 For n = 25 we know that it is composite as 25 = 5*5, but nevertheless, its binary representation "11001" encodes a (0,1)-polynomial x^4 + x^3 + 1, which is irreducible when factored over Q, thus a(25) = 1.
