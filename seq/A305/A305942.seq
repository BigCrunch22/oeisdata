%N A305942 Number of powers of 2 having exactly n digits '0' (in base 10), conjectured.
%C A305942 a(0) = 36 is the number of terms in A007377 and in A238938, which includes the power 2^0 = 1.
%C A305942 These are the row lengths of A305932. It remains an open problem to provide a proof that these rows are complete (as for all terms of A020665), but the search has been pushed to many orders of magnitude beyond the largest known term, and the probability of finding an additional term is vanishing, cf. Khovanova link.
%C A305942 The average of the first 100000 terms is ~33.219 with a minimum of 12 and a maximum of 61. - _Hans Havermann_, Apr 26 2020
