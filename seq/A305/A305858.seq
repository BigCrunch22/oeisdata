%N A305858 a(n) = number of near-rings with n elements.
%C A305858 Near-rings are defined like rings but addition need not be commutative and multiplication need only left-distribute over addition (of course, right-distribution leads to an equivalent theory). Also, there need not exist a multiplicative identity.

%F A305858 Since all rings are near-rings, a(n) >= A027623(n).
%e A305858 The only near-ring of order 1 is the trivial ring, so a(1) = 1.
%e A305858 There are 3 near-rings of order 2, all over Z2, so a(2) = 3.
%e A305858 There are 5 near-rings of order 3, all over Z3, so a(3) = 5.
%e A305858 There are 12 near-rings over Z4 and 23 near-rings over Z2^2, so a(4) = 12 + 23 = 35.
%e A305858 There are 10 near-rings of order 5, all over Z5, so a(5) = 10.
%e A305858 There are 60 near-rings over Z6 and 39 near-rings over S3, so a(6) = 60 + 39 = 99.
%e A305858 There are 24 near-rings of order 7, all over Z7, so a(7) = 24.
%e A305858 There are 135 near-rings over Z8, 1447 near-rings over D8, 281 near-rings over Q, 115 over Z4*Z2, and many over Z2^3, so a(8) > 1978.
