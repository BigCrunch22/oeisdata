%N A305934 Powers of 3 that have exactly one digit '0' in base 10.
%C A305934 Motivated by A030700: decimal expansion of 3^n contains no zeros (probably finite).
%C A305934 It appears that this sequence is finite. Is a(15) = 3^73 the last term?
%C A305934 There are no more terms through at least 3^(10^7) (which is a 4771213-digit number). It seems nearly certain that no power of 3 containing this many or more decimal digits could have fewer than two '0' digits. (Among numbers of the form 3^k with 73 < k <= 10^7, the only one having fewer than two '0' digits among its final 200 digits is 3^5028978.) - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Jun 24 2018
%C A305934 The first 6 terms coincide with A305931: powers of 3 having at least one digit 0, with complement A238939 (within A000244: powers of 3) conjectured to be finite, too. Then, a(7..8) = A305931(9..10), etc.
%F A305934 a(n) = 3^A305933(1,n).
%t A305934 Select[3^Range[120], DigitCount[#, 10, 0] == 1 &] (* _Michael De Vlieger_, Jul 01 2018 *)
%o A305934 (PARI) for(n=1,99, #select(t->!t,digits(3^n))==1&& print1(3^n","))
%Y A305934 Cf. A030700: decimal expansion of 3^n contains no zeros (probably finite), A238939: powers of 3 with no digit '0' in their decimal expansion, A000244: powers of 3.
%Y A305934 Subsequence of A305931: powers of 3 having at least one '0'.
%Y A305934 Cf. A305933: row n = { k | 3^k has n digits '0' }.
