%N A305594 Number of cyclic binary sequences of length n containing no abelian 4th powers.
%C A305594 Two length-n sequences are considered to be the same in the cyclic sense if one is a cyclic shift of the other.
%C A305594 An abelian 4th power is a word of the form x x' x'' x''', where x', x'', x''' are all permutations of x.
%e A305594 a(7) = 10, and the cyclic words are {0001001, 0001011, 0001101, 0010011, 0010101, 0010111, 0011011, 0011101, 0101011, 0110111}.
