%N A305879 Number of binary places to which n-th convergent of continued fraction expansion of Pi matches the correct value.
%C A305879 For the similar case of number of correct decimal places see A084407.
%C A305879 The denominator of the k-th convergent obtained from a continued fraction satisfying the Gauss-Kuzmin distribution will tend to exp(k*A100199), A100199 being the inverse of LÃ©vy's constant; the error between the k-th convergent and the constant itself tends to exp(-2*k*A100199), or in binary digits 2*k*A100199/log(2) bits after the binary point.
%C A305879 The sequence for quaternary digits is obtained by floor(a(n)/2), the sequence for octal digits is obtained by floor(a(n)/3), the sequence for hexadecimal digits is obtained by floor(a(n)/4).
