%N A305607 Decimal expansion of (Pi/log(2))^2/12.
%C A305607 The constant represents the mean information density per continued fraction term for continued fraction terms satisfying the Gauss-Kuzmin distribution in bits per term, i.e., for a finite continued fraction (fractional, n/d), the denominator d has approximately (1/12)*(Pi/log(2))^2*t binary digits are obtained correctly, where t is the number of terms.
%C A305607 For infinite continued fractions satisfying Gauss-Kuzmin distribution, about 2*(1/12)*(Pi/log(2))^2*t binary digits are obtained correctly from the first t continued fraction terms.
%C A305607 Note that A240995 represents the mean information density in decimal digits per term.
%C A305607 The denominator of the k-th convergent obtained from a continued fraction satisfying the Gauss-Kuzmin distribution will tend to exp(k*A100199), A100199 being the inverse of LÃ©vy's constant; i.e., in binary digits, the k-th convergent tends to A100199/log(2) binary digits.
%F A305607 Equals A100199/log(2).
%F A305607 Equals A240995*log(10)/log(2).
