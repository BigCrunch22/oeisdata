%N A342078 Odd digits only come in successive pairs (separated or not by a comma).
%C A342078 The sequence starts with a(1) = 1 and is always extended with the smallest positive integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction.
%e A342078 a(1) = 1 forces the next digit to be a 1 (as odd digits must come in pairs); the smallest positive integer not yet present that starts with a 1 and does not lead to a contradiction is 10. Thus, a(2) = 10;
%e A342078 a(3) = 2 as the smallest positive integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction is 2;
%e A342078 a(4) = 3 as the smallest positive integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction is 3;
%e A342078 a(5) = 30 as a(5) must start with a 3 (the odd digits must come in pairs) and 30 is the smallest positive integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction; etc.
