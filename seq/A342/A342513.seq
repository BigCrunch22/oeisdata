%N A342513 Number of integer partitions of n with weakly decreasing first quotients.
%C A342513 Also called log-concave-down partitions.
%C A342513 Also the number of reversed integer partitions of n with weakly decreasing first quotients.
%C A342513 The first quotients of a sequence are defined as if the sequence were an increasing divisor chain, so for example the first quotients of (6,3,1) are (1/2,1/3).
