%N A342616 a(1) = 1, a(n+1) = Sum_{d | a(n)} c_d, where c_d = number of instances of d | a(k) for 1 <= k < n.
%C A342616 For all n, we have c_1 = (n-1) since 1 | n for all nonzero n.
%C A342616 There are 2 means by which we set c_p = 1 for p prime. Let m = a(n), the progenitor of a(n+1). The first is directly via Sum_{d | a(n)} c_d = p. The second is indirectly, through Sum_{d | a(n)} c_d = m, and novel p | m. An example of the first is the appearance of a(3) = 2, and the second, a(6) = 6 is divisible by 3, a prime not yet appearing in the sequence.
%C A342616 For a(n) = p novel, a(n+1) = n, since we have (n-1) instances of d = 1 and 1 instance of p. Subsequent appearances of p have a(n+1) exceed n. Primes may appear more than once.
%C A342616 The two instances of 1 that begin the sequence yield a(3) = 2. The terms a(2) and a(3) are the only instances of a(n) < n. This is because only register c_1 > 0 for those terms, and in all other terms, we have the progenitor term a(n) > 1. Indeed, 1 can never again arise, because the only way we have Sum_{d | a(n)} c_d = 1 is when novel a(n) = 1 where d = 1 has only appeared once before. Clearly 1 has already appeared twice for n >= 2. No other number has 1 divisor, therefore there are only 2 occasions of 1 in the sequence, i.e., a(1) = a(2) = 1.
%C A342616 Generally for n > 3, m < n does not appear as a term. This implies the lower bound a(n) = n for n > 3. We have shown that a(n) = n results from certain prime progenitors m.
%C A342616 The striations seen in the scatterplot relate to the lesser prime divisors of progenitors a(n) = m -> a(n+1).
