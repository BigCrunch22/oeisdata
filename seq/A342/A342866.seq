%N A342866 The number of elements in the continued fraction for phi(n)/n, where phi is the Euler totient function (A000010).
%H A342866 Amiram Eldar, <a href="/A342866/b342866.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..10000</a>
%F A342866 a(n) = 2 if and only if n is in A007694.
%F A342866 a(p) = 3 for an odd prime p.
%e A342866 a(2) = 2 since the continued fraction of phi(2)/2 = 1/2 = 0 + 1/2 has 2 elements: {0, 2}.
%e A342866 a(3) = 3 since the continued fraction of phi(3)/3 = 2/3 = 0 + 1/(1 + 1/2) has 3 elements: {0, 1, 2}.
%e A342866 a(15) = 4 since the continued fraction of phi(15)/15 = 8/15 = 0 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/7)) has 4 elements: {0, 1, 1, 7}.
