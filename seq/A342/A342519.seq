%N A342519 Number of strict integer partitions of n with weakly decreasing first quotients.
%C A342519 Also called log-concave-down strict partitions.
%C A342519 Also the number of reversed strict partitions of n with weakly decreasing first quotients.
%C A342519 The first quotients of a sequence are defined as if the sequence were an increasing divisor chain, so for example the first quotients of (6,3,1) are (1/2,1/3).

%e A342519 The strict partition (10,7,4,2,1) has first quotients (7/10,4/7,1/2,1/2) so is counted under a(24), even though the first differences (-3,-3,-2,-1) are weakly increasing.
