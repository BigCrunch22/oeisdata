%N A342100 Abundant numbers k at which the ratio (number of abundant numbers in 1..k)/k reaches a new record high.
%C A342100 Let rho(k) = (number of abundant numbers in 1..k)/k. According to A302991 ("Decimal expansion of the asymptotic density of abundant numbers"), lim_{k->infinity} rho(k) = 0.247619...
%C A342100 a(115) = 7254; rho(7254) = 1810/7254 = 0.2495175075820...
%C A342100 Conjecture: a(115) is the final term of this sequence.
%C A342100 This sequence is finite since rho(2212) > A302991 and therefore there is a number N such that abs(rho(n) - A302991) < eps for all n > N and for an arbitrarily small eps > 0. Therefore, the number of values of n for which rho(n) > rho(2212) is finite. - _Amiram Eldar_, Dec 06 2024

%e A342100 k=12 is the 1st abundant number, so at k=12, rho(k) increases from 0 to 1/12 = 0.08333..., a record high, so a(1)=12.
%e A342100 k=18 is the 2nd abundant number, so at k=18, rho(k) reaches 2/18 = 1/9 = 0.11111..., the next record high, so a(2)=18.
%e A342100 k=20 is the 3rd abundant number, so at k=20, rho(k) reaches 3/20 = 0.15, the next record high, so a(3)=20.
%e A342100 k=24 is the 4th abundant number, so at k=24, rho(k) reaches 4/24 = 1/6 = 0.16666..., the next record high, so a(4)=24.
%e A342100 k=30 is the 5th abundant number, so at k=30, rho(k) again reaches 5/30 = 1/6; this is not a new record high, so 30 is not a term of the sequence.
