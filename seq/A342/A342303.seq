%N A342303 a(0) = 1; for n >= 1, a(n) = the decimal value of the binary number of the total binary digits back from the end of the concatenation of all previous binary terms where the binary value of n last appeared. If the binary value of n has not previously appeared then a(n) = 0.
%C A342303 The longest run of 0 terms, corresponding to binary values that have not previously appeared, for n up to 100000 is four, starting at n = 512. Not all powers of 2 are 0 as it may have appeared as a previous value's offset, e.g., a(65536) = 412323.

%e A342303 a(1) = 1 as the binary string concatenation up to a(0) = '1', and the binary value of 1 is '1' which appears 1 (1_2) digit back from the end of the string.
%e A342303 a(2) = 0 as the binary string concatenation up to a(1) = '11', while the binary value of 2 is '10' which does not appear in the string.
%e A342303 a(3) = 3 as the binary string concatenation up to a(2) = '110', and the binary value of 3 is '11' which appears 3 (11_2) digits back from the end of the string.
%e A342303 a(5) = 5 as the binary string concatenation up to a(4) = '110110', and the binary value of 5 is '101' which appears 5 (101_2) digits back from the end of the string.
