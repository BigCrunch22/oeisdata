%N A342968 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of n+2-sided polygons with the property that one makes k turns on itself while following its edges.
%C A342968 Polygons that differ by rotation or reflection are counted separately.
%C A342968 By "n+2-sided polygons" we mean the polygons that can be drawn by connecting n+2 equally spaced points on a circle (possibly self-intersecting).
%C A342968 T(0,0)=1 by convention.
%C A342968 To compute the number of turns, follow the edges of the polygon, and add the angles of rotation: positive if turning left, negative if turning right. Then take the absolute value of the sum (see illustration).

%F A342968 T(2*n-1,n)=1 for all n >= 1: the only solution is the polygon with Schl√§fli symbol {2*n+1/n}.
