%N A342039 a(n) is the index of the first occurrence of the term in A307437 that is divisible by p and greater than p, p = prime(n).
%C A342039 Different from A342038, here a nontrivial multiple of p is required.
%C A342039 a(n) exists for all n: from the formula in A307437 we know a((p-1)/2*p^e) = p^(e+1) if p is an odd prime and (p-1)*p^e+1 is composite. For fixed p, there exist infinitely many e such that (p-1)*p^e+1 is composite.
%C A342039 Conjecture: a(n) >= prime(n)-1 for all n.
%F A342039 For n = 3, prime(n) = 5. The first term in A307437 that is divisible by 5 and greater than 5 is A307437(10) = 25 = 5^2, hence a(3) = 10.
%F A342039 For n = 14, prime(n) = 47. The first term in A307437 that is divisible by 47 and greater than 47 is A307437(46) = 235 = 5*47, hence a(14) = 46.
