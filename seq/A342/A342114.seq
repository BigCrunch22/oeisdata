%N A342114 Take a(n), reverse it, divide the biggest of the two numbers by the other one and keep only the remainder. The successive remainders, concatenated, reproduce the  successive terms of the sequence, concatenated.
%C A342114 In reversing a number, leading zeros are erased. Palindromes in base 10 leave 0 as remainder.
%C A342114 This is the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms with this property.

%e A342114 a(1) = 25, which reversed is 52; 52/25 leaves a remainder 2;
%e A342114 a(2) = 13, which reversed is 31; 31/13 leaves a remainder 5;
%e A342114 a(3) = 14, which reversed is 41; 41/14 leaves a remainder 13;
%e A342114 a(4) = 247, which reversed is 742; 742/247 leaves a remainder 1;
%e A342114 a(5) = 250, which reversed is 52 (leading zeros are erased); 250/52 leaves a remainder 42;
%e A342114 a(6) = 149, which reversed is 941; 941/149 leaves a remainder 47;
%e A342114 a(7) = 52, which reversed is 25; 52/25 leaves a remainder 2; etc.
%e A342114 The successive remainders (concatenated) reproduce the (concatenated) terms of the sequence.
