%N A342445 Numbers that are divisible by their nonzero digits but are not divisible by the product of their nonzero digits.
%C A342445 Numbers that are divisible by the product of their nonzero digits (A055471) are trivially divisible by each of their nonzero digits (A002796), but the converse is false. This sequence = A002796 \ A055471 and consists of these counterexamples.
%C A342445 This sequence differs from A337163: the first sixteen terms are the same but a(17) = 202 while A337163(17) = 222.
%e A342445 204 is divisible by 2 and 4 but 204 is not divisible by 2*4 = 8, hence 204 is a term.
%e A342445 248 is divisible by 2, by 4 and by 8 but 248 is not divisible by 2*4*8 = 64, hence 248 is a term.
