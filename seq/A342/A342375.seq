%N A342375 Number of commutative rings without 1 containing n elements.
%C A342375 A ring without 1 is still a ring, but sometimes it is called a rng, or a non-unital ring, or a pseudo-ring (see Wikipedia links).
%H A342375 Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-ring">Pseudo-ring</a>.

%F A342375 a(n) = A037289(n) - A127707(n).
%e A342375 a(1) = 0 because the only ring with 1 element is the zero ring with the element 0, and for this ring, 0 and 1 coincide.
%e A342375 a(2) = 1, and for this corresponding ring with elements {0,a}, the multiplication that is defined by: 0*0 = 0*a = a*0 = a*a = 0 is commutative, also this ring is without unit, hence a(2) = 1; the Matrix ring {0,a} with coefficients from Z/2Z:
%e A342375           (0 0)           (0 0)
%e A342375       0 = (0 0)       a = (1 0)  is such an example.
%e A342375 For n=8, there are 52 rings of order 8, 24 of which are commutative rings without 1, so a(8) = 24.
%Y A342375 Number of commutative rings: A127707 (with 1 containing n elements), this sequence (without 1 containing n elements), A037289 (with n elements).
