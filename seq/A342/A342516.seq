%N A342516 Number of strict integer partitions of n with weakly increasing first quotients.
%C A342516 Also called log-concave-up strict partitions.
%C A342516 Also the number of reversed strict integer partitions of n with weakly increasing first quotients.
%C A342516 The first quotients of a sequence are defined as if the sequence were an increasing divisor chain, so for example the first quotients of (6,3,1) are (1/2,1/3).

%e A342516 The partition (6,3,2,1) has first quotients (1/2,2/3,1/2) so is not counted under a(12), even though the first differences (-3,-1,-1) are weakly increasing.
