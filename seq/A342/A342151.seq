%N A342151 Maximum number of safe (i.e., not attacked) squares when placing n queens on a standard 8 X 8 chessboard.
%C A342151 On a standard chessboard, one can place from 1 to 64 queens. By arranging them in specific patterns, one can maximize the number of "safe" squares, i.e., squares that are not attacked by any queen.
%e A342151 a(8)=11 because the maximum number of safe squares when 8 queens are placed on a regular 8 X 8 chessboard is 11. In the diagram below, each Q represents a queen and each s is a safe square:

%e A342151 This is in fact the "first" solution (when all possible ones are sorted), with the queens nearest the top-left corner.
%Y A342151 Cf. A001366, which answers the same question but on boards of different sizes and same number of queens.
