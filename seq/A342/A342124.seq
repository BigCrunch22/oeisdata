%N A342124 a(n) = smallest potential magic constant for an n X n magic square composed of consecutive primes.
%C A342124 A potential magic constant is defined by the necessary condition that for any potential magic square the sum of the consecutive primes must be divisible by the order n, and, after dividing the sum of consecutive primes by the order n, it must have the same parity as the order n.
%C A342124 The known smallest magic constants for any n X n magic square composed of consecutive primes are given by A073520. It is believed that for n >= 5, a(n) = A073520(n).
