%N A342079 Even digits only come in successive pairs (separated or not by a comma).
%C A342079 The sequence starts with a(1) = 1 and is always extended with the smallest positive integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction.
%C A342079 No term can end with an odd number of successive 0.
%e A342079 a(2) = 2 as the smallest positive integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction is 2;
%e A342079 a(3) = 21 (and not 20, as no term can end with an odd number of successive 0), because 21 is the smallest positive integer not yet present that completes a pair of identical even digits (2-2) and that does not lead to a contradiction;
%e A342079 a(4) = 3 as the smallest positive integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction is 3;
%e A342079 a(5) = 4 as the smallest positive integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction is 4;
%e A342079 a(6) = 41 (and not 40, as no term can end with an odd number of successive 0), because 41 is the smallest positive integer not yet present that completes a pair of identical even digits (4-4) and that does not lead to a contradiction; etc.
