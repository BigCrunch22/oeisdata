%N A342382 a(0) = 0; for n > 0, a(n) is the least positive integer not occurring earlier such that both the digits in a(n) and the digits in a(n-1)*a(n) are all distinct.
%C A342382 The sequence is finite, the 18351st term being a(18350) = 41987 beyond which no number exists that has not occurred earlier that has all distinct digits and that 41987*a(n) has all distinct digits. The maximum term is a(18097) = 219087.

%e A342382 a(1) = 1 as 1 has one distinct digit and a(0)*1 = 0*1 = 0 which has one distinct digit 0.
%e A342382 a(10) = 10 as 10 has two distinct digits and a(9)*10 = 9*10 = 90 which has two distinct digits 9 and 0.
%e A342382 a(11) = 12 as 12 has two distinct digits and a(10)*12 = 10*12 = 120 which has three distinct digits. Note that 11 is the first skipped number as 11 has 1 as a duplicate digit.
%e A342382 a(16) = 19 as 19 has two distinct digits and a(15)*19 = 16*19 = 304 which has three distinct digits. Note that 17 and 18 are skipped as 16*17 = 272 while 16*18 = 288, both of which contain duplicate digits.
