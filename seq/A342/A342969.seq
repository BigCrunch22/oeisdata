%N A342969 Numbers m such that both m^2-1 and m^2 are refactorable numbers (A033950).
%C A342969 Numbers m such that m^2-1 is divisible by d(m^2-1) and m^2 is divisible by d(m^2), d = A000005.
%C A342969 Zelinsky (2002, Theorem 59, p. 15) proved that if k > 1, k and k+1 are both refactorable numbers, then k is even. Such k must be of the form m^2-1 for some odd m.
%C A342969 The smallest term not divisible by 3 is a(66) = 9025.
%C A342969 For the first terms we have d(a(n)^2-1) > d(a(n)^2). But this is not always the case. The smallest counterexample is a(30) = 3591, where d(3591^2-1) = 40 and d(3591^2) = 63. The terms m such that d(m^2-1) < d(m^2) are listed in A342970. [Note that d(m^2-1) = d(m^2) is impossible since d(m^2-1) is even and d(m^2) is odd. - _Jianing Song_, Nov 21 2021]

%e A342969 39 is a term since 39^2-1 = 1520 is divisible by d(1520) = 20 and 39^2 = 1521 is divisible by d(1521) = 9.
