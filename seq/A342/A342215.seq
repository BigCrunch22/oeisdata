%N A342215 Two successive terms always share a common "digit pattern" (see the Comments section). The successive "common digit patterns", concatenated, reproduce the successive terms of the sequence, concatenated.
%C A342215 A "common pattern" shared by two successive integers A and B is a string of digits present in both A and B. For example, if A = 1 and B = 10 the common pattern is "1"; if A = 2021 and B = 302 the common pattern is "02".
%C A342215 We allow the successive terms A and B to share more than one pattern, but only in the case of a single shared longer string of digits - longer than the other possible strings; as A = 2021 and B = 231 share both the strings "2" and "1", which are of the same length, B cannot follow A in the sequence. As A = 2021 and B = 2031 share both the strings "20" and "1" and as the string "20" is longer than the string "1", B could follow A in the sequence (the "common pattern" would be "20" here).
%C A342215 This "common pattern" idea was imagined to inspire people having almost no mathematical skills - only two eyes (or one single eye) and a pencil.
%C A342215 Caveat: to reduce the computing time, no term > 10000 was tested.
%C A342215 Given the doubts about this sequence, please do NOT add a b-file. _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 14 2021

%e A342215 The first ten terms are 1, 10, 100, 101, 1201, 301, 12, 20, 104, 13.
%e A342215 The "common patterns" are 1  10   10   01    01    1   2   0    1 and their concatenation is 1101001011201 - which is exactly the start of the concatenation of the sequence's terms.
