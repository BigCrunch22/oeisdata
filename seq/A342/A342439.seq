%N A342439 Let S(n,k) denote the set of primes < 10^n which are the sum of k consecutive primes, and let K = maximum k >= 2 such that S(n,k) is nonempty; then a(n) = max S(n,K).
%C A342439 Inspired by the 50th problem of Project Euler (see link).
%C A342439 There must be at least two consecutive primes in the sum.
%C A342439 The corresponding number K of consecutive primes to get this largest prime is A342440(n) and the first prime of these A342440(n) consecutive primes is A342453(n).
%C A342439 It can happen that the sums of K = A342440(n) consecutive primes give two (or more) distinct n-digit primes. In that case, a(n) is the greatest of these primes. _Martin Ehrenstein_ proved that there are only two such cases when 1 <= n <= 19, for n = 7 and n = 15 (see corresponding examples).

%e A342439 a(1) = 5 = 2+3.
%e A342439 a(2) = 41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13; note that 97 = 29 + 31 + 37 is prime, sum of 3 consecutive primes, but 41 is obtained by adding 6 consecutive primes, so, 97 is not a term.
%e A342439 A342440(7) = 1587, and there exist two 7-digit primes that are sum of 1587 consecutive primes; as 9951191 = 5+...+13399 < 9964597 = 7+...+13411 hence a(7) = 9964597.
%e A342439 A342440(15) = 10695879 , and there exist two 15-digit primes that are sum of 10695879 consecutive primes; as 999998764608469 = 7+...+192682309 < 999999149973119 = 13+...+192682337, hence a(15) = 999999149973119.
