%N A342702 Indices of records of A007015.
%C A342702 Numbers m such that the smallest solution k to the equation phi(m+k) = phi(k) is larger than all the corresponding smallest solutions for all numbers below m.
%C A342702 The corresponding record values are 1, 4, 8, 24, 48, 52, 96, ... (see the link for more values).
%C A342702 Apparently, a(n) is even for n > 1, divisible by 6 for n > 3, by 30 for n > 9, and by 210 for n > 19. These observations are based on data up to n=100.
%C A342702 It seems that in general, for all k >= 1 there is a number n_k such that all the terms a(n) with n > n_k are divisible by the first k primes.
%C A342702 Furthermore, it seems that all the terms are of the form m*p^e, were m is a term of A055932, and p^e is a prime power (A000961).
