%N A342843 a(n) is the number of edges of the regular polygon such that packing n nonoverlapping equal circles inside the regular polygon gives the highest packing density. a(n) = 0 if such a regular polygon is a circle.
%C A342843 Terms for n = 11, 12, 13 and 14 are conjectured values supported by numerical results (see Packomania in the links).
%C A342843 It can be shown that a(n) <= n for n >= 3. As n increases, terms of values other than 3 and 6 will eventually disappear. For example, the packing density of triangular packing of more than 121 circles inside an equilateral triangle, or hexagonal packing of more than 552 circles inside a regular hexagon, is higher than that of square packing inside a square. Thus, for n > 121, the sequence does not have any terms with a(n) = 4.
%C A342843 Conjecture: As n tends to infinity, a(n) takes the value of 3 or 6 and the packing density approaches sqrt(3)*Pi/6.

%e A342843 a(1) = 0. The maximum packing density for packing 1 circle in regular m-gon is (Pi/m)*cot(Pi/m), which is an increasing function of m. Highest packing density of 1 is achieved as m tends to infinity and the regular n-gon becomes a circle.
%e A342843 a(2) = 4. The maximum packing density for packing 2 circles in regular polygon with odd number of edges m >= 3 is 4*Pi/(m*sin(2*Pi/m))/(sec(Pi/(2*m))+sec(Pi/m))^2, which is smaller than the packing density in regular polygon with even number of edges m >= 4, 4*Pi/(m*sin(2*Pi/m))/(1+sec(Pi/m))^2, which is a decreasing function of m with a maximum of Pi/(3+2*sqrt(2)) at m = 4.
