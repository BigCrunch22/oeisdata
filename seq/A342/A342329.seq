%N A342329 Number of different games of Connect Four on an (n+1) X n board.
%C A342329 There are many more game variations than positions in the game Connect Four since almost all positions can be reached in many different ways. For the regular 7 X 6 board there are 4531985219092 legal positions (see A212693). If we estimate the number of possible games with the formula (0.75*(n+1))^(n*(n+1)-1), i.e., on average the players have 75% free columns to choose from, there are about 3.0*10^29 possible games.

%e A342329 a(1) = 2: on a 2 X 1 board the first player can insert their first disc in the right or in the left column, the second player has no choice anymore, hence there are two different games. Obviously for the 2 X 1 and 3 X 2 boards, all games will end in a draw.
