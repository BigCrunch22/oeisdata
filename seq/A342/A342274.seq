%N A342274 Consider the k-th row of triangle A170899, which has 2^k terms; discard the first quarter of the terms in the row; the remainder of the row converges to this sequence as k increases.
%C A342274 This could be divided by 2 but then it would no longer be compatible with A342272 and A342273.
%C A342274 It would be nice to have a formula or recurrence for any of A170899, A342272-A342278, or any nontrivial relation between them. This might help to understand the fractal structure of the mysterious hexagonal Ulam-Warburton cellular automaton A151723.
%e A342274 Row k=6 of A170899 breaks up naturally into 7 pieces:
