%N A342795 a(n) is the number of core triads with n nodes up to isomorphism and transposition.
%C A342795 A triad is an orientation of a tree that has a single vertex of degree 3 and otherwise only vertices of degree 2 and 1. A triad T is called a core triad if every endomorphism of T is an automorphism.
%e A342795 For n = 9 the a(9) = 3 solutions are:
%e A342795   1. 0111,000,1
%e A342795   2. 01000,00,1
%e A342795   3. 01111,00,1
%e A342795 Here 0 stands for forward edge, 1 stands for backward edge, and the three words stand for the three paths that leave the vertex of degree 3 of the triad.
