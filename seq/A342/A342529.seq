%N A342529 Number of compositions of n with distinct first quotients.
%C A342529 The first quotients of a sequence are defined as if the sequence were an increasing divisor chain, so for example the first quotients of (6,3,1) are (1/2,1/3).

%e A342529 The composition (2,1,2,3) has first quotients (1/2,2,3/2) so is counted under a(8).
