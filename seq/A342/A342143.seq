%N A342143 Take a(n), sort its digits into ascending order, divide the larger of the two numbers by the smaller and keep only the remainder: this remainder is present in a(n) as a substring of its digits.
%C A342143 In sorting a number, leading zeros are erased.
%C A342143 This is the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms with this property.
%e A342143 a(1) = 10, which sorted is 1 (leading zeros are erased); 10/1 leaves a remainder 0, which is present in a(1);
%e A342143 a(2) = 20, which sorted is 2 (leading zeros are erased); 20/2 leaves a remainder 0, which is present in a(2);
%e A342143 ...
%e A342143 a(6) = 52, which sorted is 25; 52/25 leaves a remainder 2, which is present in a(6); etc.
