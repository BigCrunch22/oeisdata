%N A342353 Number of ways to choose 3 points that form an equilateral triangle from the A001845(n) points in a regular octahedral grid of size n.
%C A342353 The octahedral grid of side length n is the set of points (x,y,z) in Z^3 such that |x|+|y|+|z| <= n. The number of points in this grid is given by A001845(n).
%e A342353 For n = 1, the a(1) = 8 equilateral triangles are given by the convex hulls of {(+-1,0,0),(0,+-1,0),(0,0,+-1)}.
%Y A342353 Cf. A001845.
%Y A342353 Cf. A102698 and A334581 are analogous for the cubic grid and tetrahedral grid respectively.
