%N A342434 Solution to stepping stone puzzle on a hexagonal board (See Comments).
%C A342434 This is a variant of the stepping stone sequence (A337663), where now the board is a hexagonal grid.
%C A342434 Start with an infinite hexagonal grid. Each cell has six neighbors. Place n 1's anywhere. Now place the numbers 2, 3, ..., m in order, subject to the rule that when you place k, the sum of its neighbors must equal k. Then a(n) is the maximum m that can be achieved.
