%N A342219 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) = the number of terms in the maximal length sum of previous consecutive terms that equals n.
%C A342219 The equivalent sequence for a minimal length sum is given by A003059.

%e A342219 a(3) = 2 as the only way to sum previous consecutive terms to make 3 is 1 + 2 = 3, which contains two terms.
%e A342219 a(7) = 4 as the previous consecutive terms 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7, which contains four terms. Note that 7 can also be made by consecutive terms 2 + 2 + 3 = 7, but the sequence is the maximal sum length.
%e A342219 a(10) = 5 as the previous consecutive terms 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10, which contains five terms. Three other consecutive term sums also exist that sum to 10 but they contain fewer terms.
