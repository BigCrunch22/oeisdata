%N A342760 Fold a square sheet of paper alternately vertically to the left and horizontally downwards; after each fold, draw a line along each inward crease; after n folds, we obtain a graph G(n); G(n) is contained with G(n+1); let H be the limit of G(n) as n tends to infinity; a(n) is the number of nodes of degree 1 or 3 that are at distance n from the origin in H; a(0) = 1.
%C A342760 A342759 is the main sequence for this entry.
