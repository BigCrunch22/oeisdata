%N A342386 Smallest prime out of n^2 consecutive primes such that this set of consecutive primes has the smallest potential magic constant (as given in A342124).
%C A342386 A potential magic constant is defined by the necessary condition to obtain a magic square, that for any potential magic square the sum of the consecutive primes must be divisible by the order n, and, after dividing the sum of consecutive primes by the order n, it must have the same parity as the order n.
%C A342386 The known smallest primes out of a set of n^2 consecutive primes such that its magic constant is the smallest possible magic constant as well, are given by A104157. It is believed that for n >= 5, a(n) = A104157(n).
