%N A342042 When a digit d in the digit-stream of this sequence is even, the next digit is > d.
%C A342042 The definition refers to the digit-stream in the sequence (ignoring the commas), which starts 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 0, ...
%C A342042 The sequence is always extended with the smallest nonnegative integer not yet present that doesn't lead to a contradiction.
%C A342042 Theorem: The sequence contains every nonnegative integer except those in A347298.
%C A342042 Proved in September 2021. See S.K. link for a new, more detailed proof. - _Sebastian Karlsson_, Nov 28 2024. See N.J.A.S. link for an alternative, shorter, proof. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 29 2024

%C A342042 Let S = present sequence, P = A377912. By definition the terms in P appear in their natural order. There are A377917(k) terms in P of decimal length k >= 1. They form a consecutive block in P, starting at P(i1) and ending at P(i2), where i1 = A377918(k), i2 = A377918(k+1)-1.
%C A342042 We know S contains exactly the same terms as P, but in a different order.
%C A342042 Conjecture 1. For k >= 1, the terms of length k in S form a consecutive block with the same starting and ending points as in P. In both P and S, the block begins with 10101... (1's and 0's alternate, length is k) and end with 99...9 (k 9's).
%C A342042 Conjecture 2. We know every number appears in S. Suppose x = S(m) = 899...9 (with k-1 9's). Then x is the last term of length k in S that begins with a digit <= 8. The remaining terms of length k have leading digit 9 and appear in order, ending with 99...9 (k 9's).
%C A342042 (Some k-digit numbers beginning with 9 may appear before x.)

%C A342042 Comment from _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 01 2024 (Start)
%C A342042 Let c1 = 7.422574840... and c2 = 1.3824387... be the constants defined in A377918. Then assuming Conjecture 1, the index of the last term of length k in the present sequence is close to (c2*c1^k, 10^k). [Thanks to _Sebastian Karlsson_ for pointing out that Conjecture 1 is required and is as yet unproved.]
%C A342042   Let x = c2*c1^k, and express k in terms of x.
%C A342042 Then this point has coordinates (x,y) where y = (x/c2)^c3, with c3 = (log 10)/(log c1) = 1.14869... This defines a curve that is a good approximation to the lower envelope of the present sequence.
%C A342042 For example, the fifth meeting point has coordinates (31148, 101010) (see A377918) and the formula here gives (x,y) = (31148, 100003.0039).

%C A342042 Comment from _Sebastian Karlsson_, Dec 12 2024: (Start)
%C A342042 Theorem: Let d be in {1, 2, ..., 8}. For every positive integer k, the k-digit number d99...9 appears in the sequence before the k-digit number (d+1)99...9.
%C A342042 A proof can be found in the links. Since all k-digit numbers starting with 9 appears before any (k+1)-digit number, we get that terms of a certain length form a consecutive block. In particular, this proves Conjectures 1 and 2 above.
