%N A342537 Number of free polyominoes with n cells having simply-connected interiors.
%C A342537 The polyominoes referred to in the definition are those having a single traceable perimeter. The definition therefore includes the heptomino with a hole, as in this case the border, although not self-avoiding (it meets itself at a corner) is still traceable; it excludes the square octomino with a hole, whose border consists of two distinct polygons. Thus starting from n=8, A000104(n) < a(n) < A000105(n).
%Y A342537 Cf. A000104 (free polyominoes without holes), A000105 (free polyominoes).
