%N A342077 Prime digits only come in successive pairs (separated or not by a comma).
%C A342077 The sequence starts with a(1) = 1 and is always extended with the smallest positive integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction.
%e A342077 a(2) = 2 forces the next digit to be a 2 (as prime digits must come in pairs); the smallest positive integer not yet present that starts with a 2 is 20. Thus, a(3) = 20;
%e A342077 a(4) = 3 as 3 is the smallest positive integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction;
%e A342077 a(5) = 30 as 30 is the smallest positive integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction and starts with a 3; etc.
