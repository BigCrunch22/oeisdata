%N A342142 Take a(n), reverse it, divide the larger of the two numbers by the smaller and keep only the remainder: this remainder is present in a(n) as a substring of digits.
%C A342142 In reversing a number, leading zeros are erased.
%C A342142 This is the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms with this property.
%e A342142 a(1) = 10, which reversed is 1 (leading zeros are erased); 10/1 leaves a remainder 0, which is present in a(1);
%e A342142 a(2) = 20, which reversed is 2 (leading zeros are erased); 20/2 leaves a remainder 0, which is present in a(2);
%e A342142 a(3) = 25, which reversed is 52; 52/25 leaves a remainder 2, which is present in a(3);
%e A342142 ...
%e A342142 a(50) = 831, which reversed is 138; 831/138 leaves a remainder 3, which is present in a(50); etc.
