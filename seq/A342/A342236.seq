%N A342236 a(n) is the smallest m such that a regular m-gon with all diagonals drawn contains a cell with n sides, as in A342222, but for odd m the central m-sided polygon is not considered. Otherwise a(n) = -1 if no such m exists.
%C A342236 An m-gon with an odd number of sides contains a central cell with m sides by its construction, and it will be the m-gon with the fewest possible sides to do so. See A342222 for a proof. This sequence lists the smallest m-sided polygon to contain an n-sided cell where this central cell is not considered for odd m.
%C A342236 See A342222 for other images of the m-sided polygons.
%C A342236 a(17) is presently unknown, but if a(17) > 0 it is greater than 765.
