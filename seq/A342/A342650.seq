%N A342650 Numbers divisible both by their nonzero individual digits and by the sum of their digits.
%C A342650 Equivalently, Niven numbers that are divisible by their nonzero digits. A Niven number (A005349) is a number that is divisible by the sum of its digits.
%C A342650 Niven numbers without zero digit that are divisible by their individual digits are in A051004.
%C A342650 Differs from super Niven numbers, the first 25 terms are the same, then A328273(26) = 120 while a(26) = 111.
%C A342650 This sequence is infinite since if m is a term, then 10*m is another term.
%e A342650 102 is divisible by its nonzero digits 1 and 2, and 102 is also divisible by the sum of its digits 1 + 0 + 2 = 3, then 102 is a term.
