%N A342536 Number of self-avoiding polygons on the square lattice, of perimeter 2n, with the property that all the right-angles of the same orientation are contiguous.
%C A342536 For any polygon, build a bracelet of black and white beads by following the border of the polygon in a clockwise direction, adding a black bead for each right-turning right angle, and a white bead for each left-turning right angle. The polygons counted by this sequence are those whose bracelets have all the black beads together and all the white beads together.
%H A342536 John Mason, <a href="/A342536/a342536.pdf">Contiguously oriented saps</a>
%e A342536 a(4)=3, as there are 3 self-avoiding polygons (SAPs) of perimeter 8 that satisfy the condition; these are the polygons corresponding to the strip and L-shaped trominoes, and the square tetromino.
