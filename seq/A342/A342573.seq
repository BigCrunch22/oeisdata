%N A342573 The number of ordered n-tuples consisting of n permutations (not necessarily distinct) such that the first element of each of them is the same.
%C A342573 This is related to the stable marriage problem, as this counts the preference profiles for n men trying to marry n women when all of them prefer the same woman.
%C A342573 This sequence also counts the sets of n permutations of size n such that the i-th element of each of them is the same.
%C A342573 a(n) is a subsequence of A001013: products of factorial numbers.

%F A342573 a(n) = n*(n-1)!^n = n*A091868(n-1).
%e A342573 When n=3, we have 3 ways to fix the first element, and the remaining elements in each permutation can be in any order, yielding (3 - 1)! possible ways of ordering the rest of each permutation, so there are 3 * (2!)^3 = 24 sets of permutations.
