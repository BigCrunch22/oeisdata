%N A342325 a(n) is the position in digits of Pi where k(n) is for the first time leader in the race of digits of Pi. k(n) = 0, 1, ..., 9, 00, 01, ..., 99, 000, 001, ...
%C A342325 48 out of all 100 two-digit combinations are never in the lead when the first 100 billion digits of Pi are analyzed. 02 is the first of these 48, hence a(12) is unknown so far. The results for the 52 two-digit numbers which took the lead at some time are given in the link below.

%e A342325 a(1) = 4 because the 1 becomes the leader in the race of digits of Pi for the first time after 4 digits: 3141.
%e A342325 a(41) = 2 because k(41) = 31 and 31 is the leader after two digits of Pi.
