%N A342596 Numbers k of the earliest occurrence of widths patterns in the symmetric representation of sigma listed in the ordering of patterns in A342595.
%C A342596 This sequence is the companion to A342595 in that a(n) is the smallest number k that has row n of the table in A342595 as its width pattern in the symmetric representation of sigma(k).
%C A342596 The number of possible width patterns of length n occurring up to the diagonal in symmetric representations of sigma is A001405(n). Those are realized for n <= 4. For larger n the actual number of width patterns is smaller. Only p symmetric patterns of length 2p-1 are realizable when a number has p odd divisors and p is prime. Patterns such as  1 0 1 2 3 ... k-1 k k-1 ... 3 2 1 0 1, k >= 4, i.e., numbers with at least 6 odd divisors, cannot be realized as width patterns in the symmetric representation of sigma. If n = 2^s * p * q^2, s >= 0, p < q odd primes, then 2^(s+1) < p and row(n) < 2^(s+1) * p must hold which leads to the contradiction q^2 < p^2; if n = 2^s * p^2 * q, s >= 0, p < q odd primes, then again 2^(s+1) < p and row(n) < 2^(s+1) * p must hold which leads to the contradiction p * q < p^2.
%e A342596 a(17) = 5184 = 2^6 * 3^4 is the smallest number with width pattern (1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1).
%e A342596 a(18) = 147 = 3 * 7^2 is the smallest number with width pattern (1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1).
