%N A342376 Number of non-commutative rings without 1 containing n elements.
%C A342376 A ring without 1 is still a ring, although sometimes called a rng, or a non-unital ring, or a pseudo-ring (see Wikipedia links).
%C A342376 These are rings in which multiplication has no unit, and where there is at least one pair of non-commuting elements.
%C A342376 a(n)=0 if and only if n is squarefree.

%F A342376 a(n) = A209401(n) - A127708(n) = A342377(n) - A342375(n).
%F A342376 a(A005117(n)) = 0; a(A013929(n)) > 0.
%e A342376 For n=4, there are 11 rings of order 4, 2 of which are without 1 and non-commutative, so a(4)= 2. Note that for these 2 rings, the abelian group under addition is the commutative Klein group Z/2Z + Z/2Z. These two rings are the last two rings described in the link _Greg Dresden_ in reference: Ring 22.NC.1 and Ring 22.NC.2.
%Y A342376 Number of non-commutative rings: A127708 (with 1 containing n elements), this sequence (without 1 containing n elements), A209401 (with n elements).
