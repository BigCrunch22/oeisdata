%N A342592 Irregular triangle read by rows in which row n lists the next width pattern not yet encountered as n increases in the symmetric representation of sigma(n), where each contiguous sequence of identical widths w in A249223 is replaced by a single entry of w (see A341969).
%C A342592 Every row in the table representing a width pattern w contains an odd number 2*k - 1, k >= 1, of entries where k is the number of odd divisors of (the smallest) number n (first column in the triangle, see also A342594) whose symmetric representation of sigma(n) has width pattern w.
%C A342592 Not every possible Dyck path (see A001405) is realized as the width pattern in the symmetric representation of sigma. The (lexicographically) smallest such pattern w = ( 1 0 1 2 1 2 1 0 1 ) of length 9 would have to be realized by a number n = 2^s * p^4, s >= 0 and p an odd prime, that has 5 odd divisors; however pattern w requires 2^(s+1) < p and 2^(s+1) * p > p^2.
%C A342592 There are only k distinct width patterns of length 2*k - 1 when k is an odd prime. The values in the left parts of the k patterns are: w_i(j) = j, 1 <= j <= i <= k; w_i(j) = i-1, i+1 <= j <= k and j - i odd; w_i(j) = i, i+1 <= j <= k and j - i even. This follows from the fact that when for number n = 2^s * p^(k-1) with s >= 0 and k prime, and the leftmost maximum width in pattern w is m then p^m < 2^(s+1) < p^(m+1) so that the width pattern  m  m-1  m  m-1 ... must continue to the center of w.
%e A342592 The first 7 rows in the irregular triangle below correspond to rows 1, 3, 6, 9, 15, 18 and 21 of the triangle in A249223 of widths. Collapsing each constant section of a row to a single value in A249223 produces the left half of the corresponding row in the triangle of this sequence.
%e A342592 Every power of 2 has the width pattern (1); every odd prime has the width pattern (1, 0, 1); the triangle in A249223 shows that 12 and 24 have the same width pattern ( 1 2 1 ) as number 6.
%e A342592 The first 21 distinct width patterns. The smallest number whose symmetric representation of sigma has the width pattern of that row is listed in the  first column. All possible symmetric Dyck path patterns of lengths 1, 3, 5 and 7 are in the triangle below; their respective counts are A001405(1,2,3,4) = (1,2,3,6).
