%N A342877 a(n) = 1 if the average distance between consecutive first n primes is greater than that of the first n-1 primes, otherwise a(n) = 0, for n > 2.
%C A342877 The average distance between consecutive primes among the first n primes tends to increase with n. This average distance always changes when n is increased to n + 1, but it seems that most of the times this distance decreases. See a log-linear scatter plot of (1/n) Sum_{i=1..n} a(i) in Links.
%C A342877 Conjecture: lim_{n->infinity} (1/n) Sum_{i=1..n} a(i) < 1/2.
%C A342877 In support of the conjecture: If it is assumed, as an approximation, that position of primes follows a Poisson point process then the distance between consecutive primes is a stochastic variable with exponential probability distribution function. The probability that an exponentially distributed stochastic variable takes a value larger than the mean value is about 0.367879.

%e A342877 a(3) = 1 because the average distance between consecutive first three primes {2,3,5} is (5 - 2)/2 = 3/2 which is greater than the average distance between consecutive first two primes {2,3} which is (3-2)/1 = 1.
%e A342877 a(6)=0 because the average distance between consecutive first six primes {2,3,5,7,11,13} is (13 - 2)/5 = 11/5 which is smaller than the average distance between consecutive first five primes {2,3,5,7,11} which is (11 - 2)/4 = 9/4.
