%N A342807 Number of self-avoiding walks on a 3-dimensional cubic lattice where the walk consists of steps with incrementing length from 1 to n.
%C A342807 This sequence gives the number of self-avoiding walks on a 3-dimensional cubic lattice where the walk starts with a step length of 1 which then increments by 1 after each step up until the step length is n. The first time a collision with a previous step can occur is for n = 6. See A334877 for further details.

%e A342807 a(1) to a(5) = 6*5^(n-1) as the number of walks equals the total number of non-backtracking walks when collisions are ignored.
%e A342807 a(6) = 18630 as, given one or more steps to the right followed by an upward step, the total number of walks that collide with a previous step is 5. These steps can be taking in 4*6 = 24 ways on the cubic lattice, giving 5*24 = 120 walks in all that are eliminated. The total number of walks ignoring collisions is 6*5^5 = 18750, so the total number of self-avoiding walks is 18750-120 = 18630.
