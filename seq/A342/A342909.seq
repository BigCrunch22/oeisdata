%N A342909 a(1)=1. Thereafter, if a(n) is a novel term a(n+1) = number of prior terms > a(n); otherwise a(n+1) = number of prior terms <= a(n).
%C A342909 The definition implies that the sequence is infinite, and a(n+1) < n for all n. Conjecture: Zero occurs infinitely many times.

%e A342909 a(1)=1, the first novel term. The number of prior terms > 1 is 0, so a(2)=0. a(3) = 1, because a(2) = 0 is a novel term and there is only one term (a(1)=1)>0. Since a(3) = 1 has been seen before a(4)= 2, the number of prior terms (1,0) which are <=1.
