%N A342266 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct nonnegative terms such that both a(n) and a(n) * a(n+1) have digits in nondecreasing order.
%C A342266 10 is obviously the first integer not present in the sequence as 1 > 0; 11 will never show either because the result of a(n) * 11 is already in the sequence or because the said result has digits in contradiction with the definition.
%C A342266 It would be good to have a proof that there is an infinite sequence with the desired property. It could happen then any choice for any number of initial terms will eventually fail. - _David A. Corneth_ and _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 07 2021
%C A342266 The authors agree, but are unable to give the desired proof. So it is indeed possible that this sequence is wrong from the first term on.

%e A342266 a(5) = 4 and a(6) = 6 have product 24: the three numbers have digits in nondecreasing order;
%e A342266 a(6) = 6 and a(7) = 8 have product 48: the three numbers have digits in nondecreasing order;
%e A342266 a(7) = 8 and a(7) = 7 have product 56: the three numbers have digits in nondecreasing order; etc.
