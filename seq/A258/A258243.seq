%N A258243 Irregular triangle (Beatty tree for e) as determined in Comments; a permutation of the nonnegative integers.
%C A258243 The Beatty tree for an irrational number r > 1 (such as r = e), is formed as follows.  To begin, let s = r/(r-1), so that the sequences defined u and v defined by u(n) = floor(r*n) and v(n) = floor(s*n), for n >=1 are the Beatty sequences of r and s, and u and v partition the positive integers.
%C A258243 The tree T has root 0 with an edge to 2, and all other edges are determined as follows:  if x is in u(v), then there is an edge from x to floor(r + r*x) and an edge from x to ceiling(x/r); otherwise there is an edge from x to floor(r + r*x).  (Thus, the only branchpoints are the numbers in u(v).)
%C A258243 Another way to form T is by "backtracking" to the root 0.  Let b(x) = floor[x/r] if x is in (u(n)), and b(x) = floor[r*x] if x is in (v(n)).  Starting at any vertex x, repeated applications of b eventually reach 0.  The number of steps to reach 0 is the number of the generation of T that contains x.  (See Example for x = 20).
%C A258243 See A258212 for a guide to Beatty trees for various choices of r.

%e A258243 Generations 0 to 8 of the tree are drawn by the Mathematica program.  In T, the path from 0 to 20 is (0,2,1,5,16,6,19,54,20).  The path obtained by backtracking (i.e., successive applications of the mapping b in Comments) is (20,54,19,6,16,5,1,2,0).
