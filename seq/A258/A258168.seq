%N A258168 Number of ways to write n as floor((p^2+q)/5) with p and q both prime.
%C A258168 Conjecture: Let n be any positive integer. Then a(n) > 0. Moreover, one of the four consecutive numbers 5*n, 5*n+1, 5*n+2, 5*n+3 can be written as p^2+q with p and q both prime.
%C A258168 It seems that there are infinitely many positive integers n such that none of n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4 has the form p^2 + q with p and q both prime.
%C A258168 See also A258141 for a similar conjecture.
%C A258168 Note that neither 3763 nor 5443 can be written as floor((p^2+q)/4) with p and q both prime.

%e A258168 a(1) = 3 since 1 = floor((2^2+2)/5) = floor((2^2+3)/5) = floor((2^2+5)/5) with 2, 3, 5 all prime.
%e A258168 a(2) = 4 since 2 = floor((2^2+7)/5) = floor((3^2+2)/5) = floor((3^2+3)/5) = floor((3^2+5)/5) with 2, 3, 5, 7 all prime.
