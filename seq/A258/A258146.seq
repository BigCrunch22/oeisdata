%N A258146 Decimal expansion of (1 - 2/Pi)/2: ratio of the area of a circular segment with central angle Pi/2 and the area of the corresponding circular half-disk.
%C A258146 The formula for the ratio of the area of a circular segment with central angle alpha and the area of one half of the corresponding circular disk is (alpha - sin(alpha))/Pi. Here alpha = Pi/2.
%C A258146 This is also the ratio of the area of a circular disk without a central inscribed rectangle (2*x, 2*y) together with the two opposite circular segments each with central angle beta and the area of the circular disk. This is the analog of the ratio of the volume of a sphere with missing central cylinder symmetric hole of length 2*y and the area of the sphere. See a comment on A019699. In two dimensions this problem is not remarkable, because the radius R of the circle does matter. The formula is here: area ratio ar = 1 - (beta + sin(beta)/Pi) where beta = arcsin(2*yhat*sqrt(1-yhat^2)), with yhat = y/R, and beta = Pi - alpha from above.
%C A258146 The astonishing result from three dimensions, ar_3 = yhat^3, could suggest ar = yhat^2, which is wrong. Thanks to Sven Heinemeyer for inspiring me to look into this.
