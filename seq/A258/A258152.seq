%N A258152 Partition array in Abramowitz-Stegun order for the number of ways of putting n stones into a rectangular m X n grid of squares such that each of the m rows contains at least one stone.
%C A258152 Motivated by A258371 by _Adam J.T. Partridge_.
%C A258152 The sequence for the row lengths is A000041(n).
%C A258152 The k-th partition of n in Abramowitz-Stegun (A-St) order is denoted by P(n, k) = [1^e(n,k,1), ..., n^e(n,k,n)], with nonnegative exponents summing to m, the number of parts. Here j^0 is not 1, the corresponding P(n, k) list entry is missing, that is, this part j does not appear.
%C A258152 If the k-th partition of n in A-St order has m parts (see A008284) then the irregular triangle entry a(n, k) gives the number of ways of putting n stones into a rectangular m X n grid of squares such that each of the m rows contains at least one stone.
%C A258152 The triangle version of this partition array, with the numbers belonging to the same number of parts m of the partition of n summed, is given in A259051.
%F A258152 a(n, k) = (m!/product_{j=1..n} e(n,k,j)!)* product_{j=1..n} binomial(n, j)^e(n,k,j), for n >= 1 and k = 1, 2, ..., A000041(n). Note that for e(n,k,j) = 0 the binomial does not contribute to the product.
%e A258152 The irregular triangle a(n, k), with entries belong to the same number of parts m = 1, ..., n enclosed in brackets, begins:

%e A258152 a(4, 3) = 36 because the third partition of 4 is (2^2), and m = 2, hence (2/(2!))*binomial(4,2)^2 = 6^2 = 36. Both of the m=2 rows of n squares are occupied with two stones, hence the binomial(4,2)^2.
