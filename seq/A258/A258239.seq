%N A258239 Irregular triangle (Beatty tree for r = 2 + sqrt(2)), T, of all nonnegative integers, each exactly once, as determined in Comments.
%C A258239 Suppose that r is an irrational number > 1, and let s = r/(r-1), so that the sequences u and v defined by u(n) = floor(r*n) and v(n) = floor(s*n), for n >=1 are the Beatty sequences of r and s, and u and v partition the positive integers.
%C A258239 The tree T has root 0 with an edge to 3, and all other edges are determined as follows:  if x is in u(v), then there is an edge from x to floor(r + r*x) and an edge from x to ceiling(x/r); otherwise there is an edge from x to floor(r + r*x).  (Thus, the only branchpoints are the numbers in u(v).)
%C A258239 Another way to form T is by "backtracking" to the root 0.  Let b(x) = floor[x/r] if x is in (u(n)), and b(x) = floor[r*x] if x is in (v(n)).  Starting at any vertex x, repeated applications of b eventually reach 0.  The number of steps to reach 0 is the number of the generation of T that contains x.  (See Example for x = 8).
%C A258239 See A258212 for a guide to Beatty trees for various choices of r.

%e A258239 Generations 0 to 7 of the tree are drawn by the Mathematica program.  In T, the path from 0 to 8 is (0,3,1,6,23,7,27,8).  The path obtained by backtracking (i.e., successive applications of the mapping b in Comments) is (8,27,7,23,6,1,3,0).
