%N A258021 Eventual fixed point of map x -> floor(tan(x)) when starting the iteration with the initial value x = n.
%C A258021 Note that this sequence lists the terminating values only for the nonnegative starting points of the iteration map, although the function is defined in all Z and the intermediate steps in iteration may visit also negative numbers.
%C A258021 Pohjola conjectures that no other numbers than 0 and 1 will ever occur in this sequence.
%C A258021 In any case, any strictly positive term present in this sequence must be one of the terms of A249836.
%H A258021 Antti Karttunen, <a href="/A258021/b258021.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..10000</a>
%F A258021 If n is equal to floor(tan(n)), then a(n) = n, and for any other n (positive or negative), a(n) = a(floor(tan(n))). [Recurrence defined in whole Z.]
%o A258021 (Scheme) (define (A258021 n) (if (= n (floor->exact (tan n))) n (A258021 (floor->exact (tan n)))))
