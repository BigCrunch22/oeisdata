%N A258212 Irregular triangle (or "lower Wythoff tree", or Beatty tree for r = golden ratio ), T, of all nonnegative integers, each exactly once, as determined from the lower Wythoff sequence as described in Comments.
%C A258212 Let r = (1+ sqrt(5))/2 = golden ratio.  Let u(n) = floor[n*r] and v(n) = floor[n*r^2], so that u = (u(n)) = A000201 = lower Wythoff sequence and v = (v(n)) = A001950 = upper Wythoff sequence; it is well known that u and v partition the positive integers.  The tree T has root 0 with an edge to 1, and all other edges are determined as follows:  if x is in u(v), then there is an edge from x to floor(r + r*x) and an edge from x to ceiling(x/r); otherwise there is an edge from x to floor(r + r*x).  (Thus, the only branchpoints are the numbers in u(v).)
%C A258212 Another way to form T is by "backtracking" to the root 0.  Let b(x) = floor[x/r] if x is in u, and b(x) = floor[r*x] if x is in v.  Starting at any vertex x, repeated applications of b eventually reach 0.  The number of steps to reach 0 is the number of the generation of T that contains x.  (See Example for x = 35).
%C A258212 In the procedure just described, r can be any irrational number > 1.  Beatty trees and backtracking sequences for selected r are indicated here:
