%N A258123 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of trees with n vertices that have k vertices of maximum degree (n, k>=1).
%C A258123 Sum of entries in row n = A000055(n) = number of trees with n vertices.
%F A258123 No formula for T(n,k) or generating function is known to the author. Row 5, for example, has been obtained in the following manner. The 3 trees with 5 vertices have M-indices 9,12,16  (the M-index of a tree T is the smallest of the Matula numbers of the rooted trees isomorphic (as a tree) to T; see A235111). In A182907 one finds the degree sequence (and the degree sequence polynomial) of a rooted tree with known Matula number. To the Matula numbers 9, 12, 16, there correspond the degree sequence polynomials 3x^2 + 2x, x^3 + x^2 + 3x, x^4 + 4x, respectively. From here, number of vertices of maximum degree are 3, 1, and 1, respectively. In other words, 2 trees have 1 vertex of maximum degree, 0 trees have 2 vertices of maximum degree, and 1 tree has 3 vertices of maximum degree; this leads us to row 5: 2, 0, 1.
