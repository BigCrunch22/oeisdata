%S A258819 2,1,156,153
%N A258819 Least number k such that A258769(k) = n.
%C A258819 If a(n) exists, a(n) > 4*10^6 for n > 3.
%C A258819 For n = 2, the two fixed points occur at 17 and 20 in the section [... 44, 22, 11, 17, 26, 13, 20, 10 ...] of the trajectory. It appears that all of the trajectories of the possible k values have length 26 or 33.
%C A258819 For n = 3, the three fixed points occur at 14, 17, and 20 in the section [... 56, 28, 14, 7, 11, 17, 26, 13, 20, 10 ...] of the trajectory. It appears that all of the trajectories of the possible k values have length 26.
%C A258819 If a(n) exists for n > 3, a(n) > 5*10^9. For n = 2, besides 26 and 33, the possible k values can also have trajectories of length 182, 294, 323, and 343. - _Jud McCranie_, Oct 05 2020

Since 156 is the smallest number of have exactly this, a(2) = 156. Note that T(156) has a length 26. It appears that all candidates with 2 fixed points have a trajectory with length 26 or 33.

In the 14th, 17th, and 20th entry, there is a 14, 17 and 20, respectively. Since 153 is the smallest number to have exactly this, a(3) = 153. Note that T(153) has length 26. It appears that all candidates with 3 fixed points have a trajectory with length 26.
