%N A258019 Number of fusenes (not necessarily planar) of perimeter 2n, counted up to rotations and turning over.
%C A258019 A fusene is a benzenoid (a polyhex) which has a single component of boundary edges (that is, no holes). Including also geometrically nonplanar configurations allows helicene-like self-touching or self-overlapping structures. Thus this sequence differs from A258206 for the first time at n=13 as here a(13) = 313 [while A258206(13) = 312] because the smallest such nonplanar structure is 26-edge [6]Helicene, which is encoded by one-capped binary code 131821024 (= A258013(875) = A258015(113)). Please see the illustrations at the Wikipedia page. Note that although in their three-dimensional conformation molecules like [6]Helicene and other [n]Helicenes with n >= 6 have two different chiralities (resulting from the handedness of the helicity itself), in this count of abstract combinatorial objects they are considered achiral because of their bilateral symmetry.
%C A258019 If one counts these structures by the number of hexes (instead of perimeter length), one obtains sequence 1, 1, 3, 7, 22, 82, ... (probably A108070).

%F A258019 a(n) = (1/2) * (A258017(n) + A258018(n)). [1/2 times the count of one-sided fusenes + the count of fusenes with bilateral symmetry (subset of the former)].
