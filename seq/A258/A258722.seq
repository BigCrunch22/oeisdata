%N A258722 a(n) is the smallest k (powers of 10 excluded) such that sod(k), sod(k^2),..., sod(k^n) is an arithmetic progression, where sod(m) = A007953(m) is the sum of the digits of m.
%C A258722 Offset is 3 because an AP of one or two elements makes little sense. Powers of 10 are excluded because they form trivial infinite progressions.
%C A258722 a(14), if it exists, is greater than 4*10^12.
%e A258722 a(5) = 16 because sod(16), sod(16^2),..., sod(16^5) are equal to 7, 13, 19, 25, 31, which is an AP with common difference 6 and 16 is the smallest number with this property.
