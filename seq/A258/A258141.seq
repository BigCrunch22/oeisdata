%N A258141 Number of ways to write n as p^2 + q with p, q and 2*p + 3 all prime.
%C A258141 Conjecture: For any integer n > 0, we have a(n+r) > 0 for some r = 0,1,2,3,4,5.
%C A258141 We have verified this for n up to 10^8. See also A258139 for a weaker version of this conjecture.
%C A258141 The conjecture is somewhat similar to Goldbach's Conjecture. It implies that there are infinitely many primes p with 2*p + 3 prime.
