%N A258207 Square array: row n gives the numbers remaining after the stage n of Lucky sieve.
%C A258207 This square array A(row,col) is read by downwards antidiagonals as: A(1,1), A(1,2), A(2,1), A(1,3), A(2,2), A(3,1), etc.
%C A258207 Lucky sieve starts with natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ... from which at first stage the even numbers are removed, and on each subsequent stage n (n > 1) one sets k = <the n-th term of the preceding row> (these k will form the Lucky numbers) and removes every k-th term (from column positions k, 2k, 3k, etc.) of the preceding row to produce the next row of this array.
%C A258207 On each row n, the first term that differs from the n-th Lucky number (A000959(n)) occurs at the column position A000959(n+1) and that number is A219178(n) when n > 1.

%e A258207 ...
%e A258207 To get row 2 from row 1, we use the second term of the first row, which is 3, to remove every third term from row 1: 5, 11, 17, ... which leaves 1, 3, 7, 9, 13, ...
%e A258207 To get row 3 from row 2, we use the third term of row 2, which is 7, to remove every seventh term from row 2: 19, 39, ... which then results in the third row.
