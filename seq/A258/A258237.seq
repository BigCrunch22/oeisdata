%N A258237 Irregular triangle (Beatty tree for r = sqrt(2)), T, of all nonnegative integers, each exactly once, as described in Comments.
%C A258237 Suppose that r is an irrational number > 1, and let s = r/(r-1), so that the sequences u and v defined by u(n) = floor(r*n) and v(n) = floor(s*n), for n >=1 are the Beatty sequences of r and s, and u and v partition the positive integers.
%C A258237 The tree T has root 0 with an edge to 1, and all other edges are determined as follows:  if x is in u(v), then there is an edge from x to floor(r + r*x) and an edge from x to ceiling(x/r); otherwise there is an edge from x to floor(r + r*x).  (Thus, the only branchpoints are the numbers in u(v).)
%C A258237 Another way to form T is by "backtracking" to the root 0.  Let b(x) = floor[x/r] if x is in (u(n)), and b(x) = floor[r*x] if x is in (v(n)).  Starting at any vertex x, repeated applications of b eventually reach 0.  The number of steps to reach 0 is the number of the generation of T that contains x.  (See Example for x = 17).
%C A258237 See A258212 for a guide to Beatty trees for various choices of r.
