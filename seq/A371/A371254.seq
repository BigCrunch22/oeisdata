%N A371254 Number of vertices formed when n equally spaced points are placed around a circle and all pairs of points are joined by an interior arc whose radius equals the circle's radius.
%C A371254 Other than for n = 3, 4, and 6, all graphs so far investigated in this sequence contain some internal vertices which are created from the intersections of both 2 and 3 arcs, i.e., no graph contains only simple intersections. This is in contrast to the case where the point pairs are connected by straight lines, see A007569 and A335102, where the odd-n graphs contain only simple intersections. See the attached images.
%C A371254 Other patterns for the intersection arc counts are also seen. If n is divisible by 3 then a central vertex is always present that is created from the crossing of n arcs. If n is divisible by 6, then internal vertices are present that are created from the crossing of 6 arcs. For n = 15 and n = 45, internal vertices are present that are created from the crossing of 5 arcs - it is likely all graphs with n = 15+30*k, k>=0, contain such vertices.
%C A371254 For n = 30, the graph also contains internal vertices that are created from the crossing of 9 arcs. It is likely that all graphs with n divisible by 30 contain such vertices. As the graphs created from the straight line diagonal intersections of the regular n-gon, see A007569, also have the maximum possible line intersection count of 7 when n is divisible by 30, it is plausible that 9 is the maximum possible arc intersection count for any internal vertex, other than the central vertex when n is divisible by 3.
%C A371254 Assuming these patterns hold for all n, is it possible that there is a general formula for the number of vertices, analogous to that in A007569 for the intersections of chords in a regular n-gon?
