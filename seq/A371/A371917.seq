%N A371917 Number of inequivalent convex lattice polygons containing n lattice points (including points on the boundary).
%C A371917 A322343 counts the polygons by their number of interior lattice points, excluding points on the boundary.

%e A371917 For n = 3, the only polygon is the standard triangle with vertices (0,0), (1,0) and (0,1).
%e A371917 For n = 4, a(4) = 3 and the three polygons have vertex sets {(1,0),(0,1),(-1,-1)}, {(0,0),(2,0),(0,1)} and {(0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1)}.
