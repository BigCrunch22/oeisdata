%e A371307 a(2) = 135 as 135 = 3^3 * 5 = 10000111_2 whose digit reversal is 11100001_2 = 225 = 3^2 * 5^2, both of which have 3 and 5 as prime divisors.
%e A371307 a(10) = 1089 as 1089 = 3^2 * 11^2 whose digit reversal is 9801 = 3^4 * 11^2, both of which have 3 and 11 as prime divisors. See also A110819.
%e A371307 a(14) = 468 as 468 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 13 = 256_14 whose digit reversal is 652_14 = 1248 = 2^5 * 3 * 13, both of which have 2, 3, and 13 as prime divisors.
