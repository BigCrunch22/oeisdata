%N A371781 Numbers with biquanimous prime signature.
%C A371781 First differs from A320911 in lacking 900.
%C A371781 First differs from A325259 in having 1 and lacking 120.
%C A371781 A finite multiset of numbers is defined to be biquanimous iff it can be partitioned into two multisets with equal sums. Biquanimous partitions are counted by A002219 (aerated) and ranked by A357976.
%C A371781 Also numbers n with a unitary divisor d|n having exactly half as many prime factors as n, counting multiplicity.
%e A371781 The prime signature of 120 is (3,1,1), which is not biquanimous, so 120 is not in the sequence.
%t A371781 g[n_]:=Select[Divisors[n],GCD[#,n/#]==1&&PrimeOmega[#]==PrimeOmega[n/#]&];
%t A371781 Select[Range[100],g[#]!={}&]
%Y A371781 A number's prime signature is given by A124010.
%Y A371781 For prime indices we have A357976, counted by A002219 aerated.
%Y A371781 The complement for prime indices is A371731, counted by A371795, A006827.
%Y A371781 The complement is A371782, counted by A371840.
