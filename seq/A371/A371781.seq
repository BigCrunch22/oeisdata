%N A371781 Numbers with biquanimous prime signature.
%C A371781 First differs from A320911 in lacking 900.
%C A371781 First differs from A325259 in having 1 and lacking 120.
%C A371781 A finite multiset of numbers is defined to be biquanimous iff it can be partitioned into two multisets with equal sums. Biquanimous partitions are counted by A002219 (aerated) and ranked by A357976.
%C A371781 Also numbers n with a unitary divisor d|n having exactly half as many prime factors as n, counting multiplicity.
