%N A371674 Number of maximal distance-critical graphs on n vertices.
%C A371674 A distance-critical graph is considered to be a connected graph such that no vertex can be deleted without altering the distance metric on the remaining vertices. A maximal distance-critical graph is considered to be a distance critical graph such that the addition of any edge or edges will no longer result in a distance critical graph.
