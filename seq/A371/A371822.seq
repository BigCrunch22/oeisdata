%N A371822 Triangle read by rows. Row n is the lexicographically earliest permutation of length n, that can be obtained from row n-1 by inserting the element n and optional cyclical shifting such that the maximum possible pattern density will be reached.
%C A371822 The first 13 rows include shortest k-superpatterns for k up to 5. These k-superpatterns are also optimal superpatterns. Optimal means the overall pattern density including patterns of all length is maximal among all permutations of [n]. How many more shortest superpatterns will be given by this sequence? The next will be expected in row 17.
%C A371822 Row n is a k-superpattern if the first k entries in row n from A371823 are k!. If n also coincidences with A342474(n), then it is a shortest possible k-superpattern.
%C A371822 All yet known rows agree up to some cyclical shift with rows from A194832, this could indicate that A194832 will at least almost optimize the pattern density for permutations on the circle.
%C A371822 The above observations have strong statistical arguments, because (1+sqrt(5))/2 has the simplest possible continued fractions expansion of all irrational numbers it will optimize asymptotically the pattern density in the permutations induced by it.
