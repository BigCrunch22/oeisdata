%N A371636 For any number k >= 0, let T_k be the triangle with values in {-1, 0, +1} whose base corresponds to the balanced ternary expansion of k (without leading zeros) and other values, say t above u and v, satisfy t+u+v = 0 mod 3; this sequence lists the numbers k such that T_k has 3-fold rotational symmetry.
%C A371636 This sequence is a variant of A334556 and A361818.
%C A371636 This sequence is infinite as it contains A003462.
%C A371636 Empirically, for any w > 0, there are A127975(w-1) terms with w balanced ternary digits (ignoring leading zeros).
%C A371636 If k is a term then A338246(k) is also a term.

%e A371636 The balanced ternary expansion of 595 is "1T11001" (where T denotes -1), and the corresponding triangle T_595 is as follows:
%e A371636            1
%e A371636           T 0
%e A371636          1 0 0
%e A371636         1 1 T 1
%e A371636        0 T 0 1 1
%e A371636       0 0 1 T 0 T
%e A371636      1 T 1 1 0 0 1
%e A371636 As this triangle has 3-fold rotational symmetry, 595 belongs to the sequence.
