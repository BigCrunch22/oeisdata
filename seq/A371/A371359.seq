%N A371359 a(1)=1; for n>1, a(n) = a(n-1) / k if there exists an unused positive integer k (choose the smallest) such that a(n) is a distinct positive integer; otherwise a(n) = a(n-1) * k if the same conditions apply.
%C A371359 A sequence of distinct positive integers in which the ratios of successive terms (larger over smaller) are all distinct.
%C A371359 A100707 is an analogous sequence using addition and subtraction.

%e A371359 a(1)=1: 1 * 2 = 2 (k=2 is the smallest number not yet used as a divisor or multiplier).
%e A371359 a(2)=2: 2 * 3 = 6 (k=3 has not been used before).
%e A371359 a(3)=6: 6 * 4 = 24 (k=4 has not been used before).
%e A371359 a(4)=24: 24 / 6 = 4 (k=6 has not been used before).
%e A371359 a(11)=72: 72 / 24 = 3 (k=24 has not been used before). Note that we would have used k=12 if this did not result in a repeated term (72 / 12 = a(3)=6).
