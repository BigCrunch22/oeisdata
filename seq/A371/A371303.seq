%N A371303 Numbers k > 4 such that both k - 2^(2^m) and k + 2^(2^m) are prime for every natural m > 0 with 2^(2^m) < k.
%C A371303 It seems that there are infinitely many such numbers.
%C A371303 If k > 7 is such a number, then it is odd and divisible by 3.
%C A371303 Conjecture: numbers k > 2 such that both k - 2^(2^m) and k + 2^(2^m) are prime for every integer m >= 0 with 2^(2^m) < k are only 9, 15, and 195 (_Amiram Eldar_ checked that there are no more terms k < 10^8).
