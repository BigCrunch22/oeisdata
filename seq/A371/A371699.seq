%N A371699 The smallest composite number which divides the concatenation of its descending ordered prime factors, with repetition, when written in base n.
%C A371699 Conjecture: a(n) <= A371641(n) for n >= 2.
%H A371699 Chai Wah Wu, <a href="/A371699/b371699.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 2..10000</a>
%F A371699 If p is prime, then a(p*(m+2)-1) <= p^2 for all m >= 0.
%F A371699 If n+1 is composite, then a(n) <= q^2, where q = A020639(n+1) is the smallest prime factor of n+1. This implies that if n > 2 is odd, then a(n) = A371641(n) = 4.
%F A371699 The first few terms n where n+1 is composite and a(n) < A020639(n+1)^2 are a(288) = 70, a(298) = 42, a(340) = 42, a(360) = 182, ...
%F A371699 If n is even, then a(n) >= 9. This is true as it is easy to verify that a(n) cannot be equal to 4, 6 or 8 in this case.
%F A371699 Suppose n>2 is even. 2 concatenated twice in base n is 2(n+1) which is not divisible by 4.
%F A371699 Next, 3 concatenated by 2 is 3*n+2 which is not divisible by 6. Finally 2 concatenated 3 times is 2(n^3-1)/(n-1) which is not divisible by 8 since n^3-1 is odd.
%F A371699 This implies that if n = 6*k+2 for some k > 0, then a(n) = A371641(n) = 9.
%e A371699 a(2) = 42 since 42 = 7*3*2 = 111_2 * 11_2 * 10 _2 and 42 divides 126 = 1111110_2.
%e A371699 a(10) = 378 since 278 = 7*3*3*3*2 and 278 divides 73332.
