%N A371664 a(n) is the number of arithmetic progressions that can be formed from all the interior angles (all integers when measured in degrees) of a regular polygon with A371663(n) sides.
%C A371664 Since A371663 is finite, this sequence is also finite.
%C A371664 With all interior angles (integers when measured in degrees) of simple polygons, two geometric progressions (see comments in A000244 and A007283 from Feb 15 2024) and 357 arithmetic progressions are possible.

%e A371664 Since A371663(17) = 45 and from a 45-gon 8 arithmetic progressions p_i(k) can formed from all its interior angles (all integer, in degrees), a(17) = 8. The 8 sequences are: p_1(k) = 172, p_2(k) = k + 150, p_3(k) = 2k + 128, p_4(k) = 3k + 106, p_5(k) = 4k + 84, p_6(k) = 5k + 62, p_7(k) = 6k + 40, p_8(k) = 7k + 18, for integers k with 0 <= k <= 44.
