%N A371074 Number of the rightmost decimal digits of n that are the same as those of n^n.
%C A371074 The common digits might include leading 0's (such as at n = 51 or n = 57) and they are included in the total.
%C A371074 Let c be a positive integer and assume that k is a positive integer that is not a multiple of 10. If n = k*10^c, then a(n) = c which is all the rightmost 0's of n.
%C A371074 For every n >= 0, a(n) is the congruence speed of n at height 1 by Definitions 1.1 and 1.3 of the paper entitled "Number of stable digits of any integer tetration" (see Links).

%F A371074 For any n >= 2, a(n) is such that n == n^n (mod 10^(a(n))) and n <> n^n (mod 10^(a(n)+1)).
%e A371074 a(0) = 0 since 0^0 = 1 so that 0 and 0^0 have no digits in common.
%e A371074 For n = 51, a(n) = 3 since 51^51 == 5051 (mod 10^4).
