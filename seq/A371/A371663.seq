%N A371663 a(n) is the number of sides of simple polygons (sorted in ascending order) for which one or more arithmetic sequences can be formed from all their interior angles (all integer, in degrees).
%C A371663 Since for n >= 357 every arithmetic sequence with d != 0 would have a smallest term less than 1 and for n > 360 no regular polygon with integer angles exists (see also A018412), this sequence is finite and contains 27 terms.
%C A371663 Subsequence of A018609 (Divisors of 720).
%H A371663 Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_progression">Arithmetic progression</a>.
%e A371663 Since the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees and an interior angle is 60 degrees on average, arithmetic sequences 60 - d, 60, 60 + d are possible, for integers d with 0 <= d <= 59. Therefore 3 is a term.
%e A371663 Since the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees and an interior angle is 90 degrees on average, arithmetic sequences 90 - 3d/2, 90 - d/2, 90 + d/2, 90 + 3d/2 are possible, for even d with 0 <= d <= 58. Therefore 4 is a term.
%e A371663 Since the sum of the interior angles of a 16-gon is 2520 degrees and an interior angle is 157.5 degrees on average, arithmetic sequences 157.5 - 15d/2, 157.5 - 13d/2, 157.5 - 11d/2, 157.5 - 9d/2, 157.5 - 7d/2, 157.5 - 5d/2, 157.5 - 3d/2, 157.5 - d/2, 157.5 + d/2, 157.5 + 3d/2, 157.5 + 5d/2, 157.5 + 7d/2, 157.5 + 9d/2, 157.5 + 11d/2, 157.5 + 13d/2, 157.5 + 15d/2 are possible, for odd d with 1 <= d <= 19. Therefore 16 is term.
