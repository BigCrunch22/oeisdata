%N A371844 Center column of elementary triangular automaton rule 37, from a lone 1 cell.
%C A371844 An Elementary Triangular Automaton (ETA) is a cellular automaton in the triangular grid where cells hold binary states and rules are local to the first neighborhood. There are 256 possible ETA rules.
%C A371844 Rule 37 (100101 in binary):
