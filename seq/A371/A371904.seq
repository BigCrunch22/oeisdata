%N A371904 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number such that 2^a(n) contains a(n-1) as a substring.
%C A371904 The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A371904 a(2) = 4 as 2^4 = 16 which contains a(n-1) = a(1) = '1' as a substring.
%e A371904 a(7) = 14 as 2^14 = 16384 which contains a(n-1) = a(6) = '3' as a substring. Note that 2^5 = 32 also contains '3' as a substring but 5 has already been used.
