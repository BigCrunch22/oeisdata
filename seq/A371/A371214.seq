%N A371214 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct nonnegative integers such that for any n > 0, a(n-1) + a(n) is a multiple of n, and the least value not yet in the sequence appears as soon as possible.
%C A371214 To build the sequence:
%C A371214 - we start with a(0) = 0, and repeatedly:
%C A371214 - let a(n) be the last known term and v the least value not yet in the sequence,
%C A371214 - if a(n) + v is a multiple of n+1 then a(n+1) = v,
%C A371214 - otherwise a(n+2) = v and a(n+1) is chosen as small as possible in such a way as to satisfy the required congruences (this is always possible as n+1 and n+2 are coprime).
%C A371214 The construction is similar to that of A367288.
%C A371214 This sequence is a variant of A099506 and, by design, is guaranteed to be a permutation of the nonnegative integers (with inverse A371215).
