%N A371217 The maximum deck size to perform Colm Mulcahy's n-card trick.
%C A371217 With this card trick the magician's assistant gets n cards from a deck, hides one card, and displays the rest, where it is allowed to place some of the displayed cards face down. After that, the magician guesses the hidden card.
%C A371217 The trick for n = 4 was invented by Colm Mulcahy and is a variation of the Fitch Cheney trick. Surprisingly, the largest possible deck is the standard deck of 52 cards.

%e A371217 Suppose the deck consists of 4 cards (1,2,3,4), and the assistant gets two cards. If the two cards contain 4, the assistant hides 4 and signals it with the other card face down. If there is no 4, then the cards are a and a+1 modulo 3. The assistant hides a+1, and signals it with a.
