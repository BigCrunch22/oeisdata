%N A371476 a(n) is the number of free polyominoes of size n with at least one solution to the One Up puzzle (see comments).
%C A371476 The objective of the One Up puzzle is to assign a positive integer to each cell of a given polyomino in such a way that the cells of any maximal 1 X k strip (horizontal or vertical) are numbered 1, ..., k (in some order). The maximality is applied to horizontal and vertical strips separately, implying that the number 1 must be assigned to a cell with no left or right neighbors even if it has neighbors above or below (and vice versa). (In an extended version of the puzzle, there may be walls between certain pairs of neighboring cells, and only those strips that do not extend over a wall are considered.) - _Pontus von Brömssen_, Mar 26 2024
