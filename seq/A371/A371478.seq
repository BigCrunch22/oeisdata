%N A371478 Numbers k for which k swaps are needed to bubble-sort the US English number name of k.
%C A371478 No swaps involve hyphens or spaces.
%C A371478 Only four such numbers < 100 have this property: are there more?
%C A371478 In French, only three such numbers are known: 1, 14, 23.
%C A371478 For number names up to one million, the number of swaps does not exceed 712. - _Hans Havermann_, Mar 25 2024
%C A371478 There are no more terms. Computationally, there are none < 10^9. If the name of n has k letters, a(n) <= k*(k-1)/2 from the properties of bubble sort.  Also, if 1000^(e-1) <= n < 1000^e, then k <= 41*e, where the loose upper bound comes from "threehundredseventythree" and "quattuordecillion" considering all terms up to 10^66 using English names of large numbers (see Wikipedia link). Thus, a(n) <= 820*e^2 <= 1000^(e-1) for e >= 3. Similar bounds can be derived for extended naming schemes. - _Michael S. Branicky_, Mar 26 2024
