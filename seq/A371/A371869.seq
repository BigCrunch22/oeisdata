%N A371869 Number of 2-connected chordal bipartite graphs on n unlabeled vertices.
%C A371869 A chordal bipartite graph is a bipartite graph with no induced cycles longer than 4-cycles. Note that this is not the same as a bipartite graph which is chordal, as that would exclude all cycles.
%H A371869 Brendan McKay, <a href="https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/nauty/">nauty software</a> that can generate these graphs.

%e A371869 For n=4, the only example is the 4-cycle. For n=5, the only example is K(2,3).
