%N A371867 Number of chordal bipartite graphs on n unlabeled vertices.
%C A371867 A chordal bipartite graph is a bipartite graph with no induced cycles longer than 4-cycles. Note that this is not the same as a bipartite graph which is chordal, as that would exclude all cycles. This sequence includes disconnected graphs.

%e A371867 For n=3, the three examples are the two disconnected graphs and the path.
