%N A371918 The smallest unused positive number such that 2^a(n) contains n as a substring.
%C A371918 The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A371918 a(0) = 10 as 2^10 = 1024 which contains '0' as a substring.
%e A371918 a(6) = 6 as 2^6 = 64 which contains '6' as a substring. Note that 2^4 also contains '6' but 4 has already been used. This is the first term to differ from A063565.
