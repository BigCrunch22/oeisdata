%N A371782 Numbers with non-biquanimous prime signature.
%C A371782 A finite multiset of numbers is defined to be biquanimous iff it can be partitioned into two multisets with equal sums. Biquanimous partitions are counted by A002219 (aerated) and ranked by A357976.
%C A371782 Also numbers n without a unitary divisor d|n having exactly half as many prime factors as n, counting multiplicity.
