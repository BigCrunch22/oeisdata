%N A371078 Numbers formed by the rightmost decimal digits of n^n that are the same as those n^(n^n), where -1 indicates that n^n <> n^(n^n) (mod 10).
%C A371078 The common digits might include leading 0's (such as at n = 5 or n = 43) and they are discarded (in particular, a(0) = 0 indicates that the corresponding zero digit term results in a 0 integer entry).
%C A371078 For n = k*10^c with c >= 1 and k != 0 (mod 10), a(n) = 0 since n^n has (exactly) c*n rightmost 0's.
%C A371078 a(n) is equal to -1 if and only if n == 2 or 18 (mod 20).

%F A371078 If n <> 2,18 (mod 20), then a(n) = A000312(n) (mod 10^k), where k is such that n^n == n^(n^n) (mod 10^k) and n^n <> n^(n^n) (mod 10^(k+1)), whereas a(n) = -1 otherwise.
%e A371078 For n = 6, 6^6 = 46656 and 6^(6^6) == 8656 (mod 10^4) so there are three common final digits and a(6) = 656.
