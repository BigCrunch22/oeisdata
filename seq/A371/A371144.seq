%N A371144 The smallest number such that the concatenation of n, a(n), n+1 is divisible by the concatenation of n and n+1.
%C A371144 For n > 10, when n starts with the digits 1, 2, 3, or 4, then a(n) = 2*n + 1. When n starts with the digits 5, 6, 7, or 8, then a(n) = 11*n + 10 for the vast majority of terms, although some outliers exist e.g., a(749) = 2251. When n starts with the digit 9, the values are somewhat more varied.
%C A371144 The maximum possible value for any term is the concatenation of n+1 and n, see the example for a(6) below. However except for a(6) and a(8), for the terms studied this only occurs four times for every order of magnitude increase in n, namely the four numbers consisting of all 9's except for the final digit of 0, 2, 6, or 8.
%C A371144 The first duplicate term is a(5) = a(18) = 37. There are 234 duplicates in the first 10000 terms.
