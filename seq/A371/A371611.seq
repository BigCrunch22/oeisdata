%N A371611 Number of 2*n-sided cycles with the property that one makes the same number of left and right turns while following its edges.
%C A371611 Cycles that differ by rotation or reflection are counted separately. By "n-sided cycles" we mean the cycles that can be drawn by connecting n equally spaced points on a circle (possibly self-intersecting).

%F A371611 a(n) is always divisible by 2*n, because the considered cycles cannot have rotational symmetry.
