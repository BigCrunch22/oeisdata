%N A253385 Numbers divisible by at least three distinct primes whose largest prime power factor is not based on its smallest nor its greatest prime factor.
%C A253385 This sequence contains all unimodal composites (numbers whose list of prime factors is strictly increasing then strictly decreasing).
%e A253385 90 is the first member of this sequence because its prime factor decomposition is 2*3^2*5, using the three smallest primes and 3^2 = 9 is the first power of 3 greater than 5 (and 2).
