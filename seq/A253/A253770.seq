%N A253770 Number of ON states after n generations of cellular automaton based on triangles, with diamonds.
%C A253770 Also 6 times the Y-toothpicks sequence A160120.
%C A253770 Explanation: consider the Y-toothpick structure of A160120, then replace every Y-toothpick with six ON cells forming a star with three rhombuses (or diamonds) that share only one vertex. Every diamond contains two triangular cells that share one edge.
%C A253770 The rules are the essentially the same as A160120.
%C A253770 An ON cell remains ON forever.
%C A253770 The sequence gives the number of triangular ON cells after the n-th stage.
%C A253770 A253771 (the first differences) give the number of triangular cells turned "ON" at the n-th stage.
%C A253770 A160120 (the Y-toothpick sequence) gives the number of stars in the structure after the n-th stage.
%C A253770 A160121 gives the number of stars added at the n-th stage.
%C A253770 A160167 gives the number of diamonds in the structure after the n-th stage.

%F A253770 a(n) = 6*A160120(n) = 3*A160157(n) = 2*A160167(n).
%e A253770 After one generation, the cellular automaton looks like a star or a flower with three petals as shown below:
%e A253770 .
%e A253770 .        /\
%e A253770 .       _\/_
%e A253770 .      /_/\_\
%e A253770 .
%e A253770 There are one star, three diamonds and six ON cells, so a(1) = 6.
