%N A253057 Complete list of numbers that take three steps to collapse to a single digit in base 3 (written in base 10).
%C A253057 From _Simon Demers_, Oct 20 2017: (Start)
%C A253057 This an exceptionally nice finite sequence based on a surprisingly simple but nontrivial rule: collapse the number expressed in base 3 by inserting plus signs and adding, while minimizing the number of steps (applications).
%C A253057 Butler et al. (2014) proved that any number written in base 2 can be collapsed to a single digit in at most two steps. Any number written in base 3 can be collapsed to a single digit in at most two steps except, surprisingly, for the 11 numbers listed in this sequence. One thing that separates base 3 from larger bases is that there are only 11 base-3 numbers that require three applications!
%C A253057 Let m be the sum of the digits in base-3 expansion. Butler et al. (2014) showed that candidates for this sequence must have m < 82.

%C A253057 In base 3, the terms are written as 2102222, 11102222, 12022222, 120022222, 202022221, 1200022222, 2002022221, 2020022221, 12000022222, 20200022221, 202000022221. - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Oct 20 2017

%e A253057 In base 3, one of the possible ways to collapse a(1) in three steps is as follows:
%e A253057 2102222 -> 2102 + 222 = 10101 -> 1 + 01 + 01 = 10 -> 1 + 0 = 1.
