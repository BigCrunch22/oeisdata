%N A253593 a(n) is the largest of the first n terms in A098550 for which the numbers 1 to a(n) are a subset, pretending all primes present.
%e A253593 a(9) = 5 because the first 9 terms in A098550 are {1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 15, 14, 5}, and {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is a subset.
%e A253593 a(10) = 9 because the first 10 terms in A098550 are {1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 15, 14, 5, 6}; and pretending that prime 7 is present, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} is a subset.
