%N A253090 Number of ON cells at generation n of 9-celled totalistic CA defined by Rule 614.
%C A253090 A cell turns ON at generation n iff it was OFF at generation n-1 and exactly 1 or 3 of its 8 neighbors were ON, or if it was ON and exactly 0, 2 or 4 of its 8 neighbors were ON.
%C A253090 Note that although A072272 is an "odd-rule" CA, this one is not.
