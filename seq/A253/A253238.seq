%N A253238 Number of ways to write n as a sum of a perfect power (>1) and a prime.
%C A253238 In this sequence, "perfect power" does not include 0 or 1, "prime" does not include 1. Both "perfect power" and "prime" must be positive.
%C A253238 In the past, I conjectured that a(n) > 0 for all n>24, but this is not true. My PARI program found that a(1549) = 0.
%C A253238 I also asked which a(n) are 1. For example, 331 is a de Polignac number (A006285), so it cannot be written as 2^n+p with p prime, and 331-6^n must divisible by 5, 331-10^n must divisible by 3, ..., 331-18^2 = 331-324 = 7 is prime (and it is the only prime of the form 331-m^n, with m, n natural numbers, m>1, n>1), so a(331) = 1. Similarly, a(3319) = 1. Conjecture: a(n) > 1 for all n > 3319.
%C A253238 This conjecture is not true: a(1771561) = 0. (See A119748)
%C A253238 Another conjecture: For every number m>=0, there is a number k such that a(n)>=m for all n>=k.
%C A253238 Another conjecture: Except for k=2, first occurrence of k must be earlier then first occurrence of k+1.
%C A253238 For n such that a(n) = 0, see A119748.
%C A253238 For n such that a(n) = 1, see the following a-file of this sequence.
