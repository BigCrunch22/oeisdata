%C A206768 For a given n, n being even, among the integers k satisfying the property sigma(k-n) = sigma(k)-n, we will find prime numbers p, such that p and p-n are primes. This is because in that case sigma(p-n) = (p-n)+1 = (p+1)-n = sigma(p)-n. For instance, when n is even, for n=2 to 14, a(n) is the first term of A006512, A046132, A046117, A092402, A092146, A092216, A098933. If we restrict to composite numbers, then see A084293. - _Michel Marcus_, Feb 16 2013
%C A206768 For the missing terms mentioned in first comment, a(n) is > 10^7. - _Michel Marcus_, Sep 21 2013
%e A206768 a(13) = 4431 because 4431 is the minimum number for which sigma(4431-13) = sigma(4418)= 6771 and sigma(4431) - 13 = 6784 -13 = 6771.
%e A206768 a(19) = 25 because 25 is the minimum number for which sigma(25-19) = sigma(6) = 12 and sigma(25) - 19 = 31 -19 = 12.
