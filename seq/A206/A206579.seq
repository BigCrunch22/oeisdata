%N A206579 Numbers k such that the periodic part of the continued fraction of sqrt(k) has more ones than any smaller k.
%C A206579 The number 1 is the most common number in continued fractions of sqrt(k) for k = 1, 2, 3, ....
%C A206579 Most of the terms in this sequence are the product of a prime and a power of 2. There are only three exceptions less than 10^6: 133, 253621, and 375181.
%e A206579 The periodic part of the continued fraction of sqrt(7) is (1, 1, 1, 4), which has more ones than any smaller square root.
