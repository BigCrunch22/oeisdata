%N A206430 Least k such that k*2^m - 1 has a covering set with precisely n primes.
%C A206430 A set of primes is a covering set for k*2^m - 1 if for every positive integer m there is some prime in the set which divides k*2^m - 1. Only minimal covering sets are considered here (those which would not remain covering sets with the removal of any element).
