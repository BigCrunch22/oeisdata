%N A206345 Number of solvable clock puzzles with n positions in Final Fantasy XIII-2.
%C A206345 The sequence gives the number of ways of placing the integers 1, 2, ..., floor(n/2) (with repetition) in n spaces on a circle so that you can jump to every integer exactly once, and the distance you jump is equal to the integer you are currently standing on.
%C A206345 A206344 is a trivial upper bound.
%C A206345 This is the same as A206346, except clock puzzles that are rotations or reflections of each other are counted as distinct.

%e A206345 A solvable clock puzzle in the n = 6 case arises from the following integers (placed clockwise around a circle): 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3. If we label the positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, then a solution to this puzzle is the following sequence of positions: 0, 1, 4, 3, 5, 2.
%Y A206345 Cf. A206344, A206346.
