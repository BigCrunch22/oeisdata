%N A130898 Number of partitions of n into "number of partitions of n into partition numbers" numbers.
%C A130898 The "partition transformation" of sequence A can be defined as the number of partitions of n into elements of sequence A. This is the partition transformation composed with itself three times on the positive integers.
%C A130898 a(6) = 10 because there are 10 partitions of 6 whose parts are 1,2,3,4,6 which are terms of sequence A007279, which is the number of partitions of n into partition numbers.
