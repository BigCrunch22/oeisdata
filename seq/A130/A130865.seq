%N A130865 a(1)=1. The n-th run (after the initial 1) consists of (a(n)*n) repeated a(n) times.
%e A130865 The fifth run (after the initial 1) consists of (5*a(5)) = 30 repeated a(5)=6 times. (The first run after the initial 1 consists of one 1. So (a(1),a(2)) = (1,1) actually consists of 2 different runs.)
