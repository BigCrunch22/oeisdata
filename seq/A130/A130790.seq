%N A130790 Number of nodes in the Lucas-Pratt primality tree rooted at prime(n).
%C A130790 The primality tree starts at an odd prime at the root node. The branches of each node are the odd primes that divide the value of (the node minus 1). The length of the longest branch is related to A126805. Following the branch with the largest label gives A083647.
