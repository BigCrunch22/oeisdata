%N A130899 Number of partitions of n into "number of partitions of n into 'number of partitions of n into partition numbers' numbers" numbers.
%C A130899 The "partition transformation" of sequence A can be defined as the number of partitions of n into elements of sequence A. This sequence (A130899) is the partition transformation composed with itself four times on the positive integers.
%H A130899 Alois P. Heinz, <a href="/A130899/b130899.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..1000</a>
%e A130899 a(6) = 9 because there are 9 partitions of 6 whose parts are 1,2,3,5,6 which are terms of sequence A130898, which is the number of partitions of n into numbers of partitions of n into partition numbers.
