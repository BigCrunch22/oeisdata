%N A130676 Numbers n for which either 16*n^2-6*n+1 or 16*n^2-10*n-1 or both is/are prime.
%C A130676 Consider the two forms (4*n-2)*4*n +- (2*n+1), where "+-" generates two different terms 16*n^2-6*n+1 and 16*n^2-10*n-1 for n=1,2,3,...
%C A130676 If at least one of the two numbers is prime, n is inserted into the sequence.
%e A130676 For n=20, 16*20^2 - 10*20 - 1= (4*20-2)*4*20-(2*20+1) = 6199 is prime, which adds 20 to the sequence.
%e A130676 For n=15, 16*15^2 - 6*15 +1= (4*15-2)*4*15 +(2*15+1) = 3511 is prime, which adds 15 to the sequence.
