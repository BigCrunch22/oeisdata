%N A130540 Triangle read by rows T(n,k) in which column k lists the terms of A000203 interspersed with (k-1) zeros, 1 <= k <= n.
%C A130540 The original definition was: A127093 * A125093^(-1).
%C A130540 Left border = A000203, sigma(n): (1, 3, 4, 7, 6, ...). Row sums = A007429: (1, 4, 5, 11, 7, 20, 9, ...); = inverse Moebius transform applied to sigma(n); (i.e., inverse Moebius transform applied twice to natural numbers).
%C A130540 T(n,k) is the total number of parts congruent to 0 mod k in the partitions of n into equal parts. - _Omar E. Pol_, Nov 19 2019
%C A130540 From _Omar E. Pol_, Jan 01 2020: (Start)
%C A130540 Conjecture 1: the sum of odd-indexed terms in row n equals A327096(n).
%C A130540 Conjecture 2: the sum of even-indexed terms in row n equals the n-th term of the sequence formed by A000004 and A007429 interleaved.
%C A130540 Conjecture 3: alternating row sums give A288417. (End)
