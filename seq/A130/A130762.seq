%N A130762 A fold back triangular sequence for A003991: symmetrical folding and addition of.
%C A130762 Row sum is still A000292. These sequences are related to heights of Cartan A_n groups. I spent half the night trying to get this algorithm to work and just barely got this to do what I was doing with ease by hand. The other fold back sequences were analogs for this.
%F A130762 a0(n,m) = (n-m)*(1+m) Doubling of all elements a(n,m)=2*a0(n,m)-> m->Floor[n/2] except for the uneven middle element on odd sequences in n.
