%N A130975 a(n) = sum of numbers without digit 1 and with product of digits = n-th 7-smooth number.

%e A130975 First 7-smooth number is 1. Sum of numbers without digit 1 and with product of digits = 1 is 0 since there are no such numbers. Hence a(1) = 0.
%e A130975 Eighth 7-smooth number is 8, numbers without digit 1 and with product of digits = 8 are 8, 24, 42, 222. These sum to 296, hence a(8) = 296.
%e A130975 Eleventh 7-smooth number is 12, numbers without digit 1 and with product of digits = 12 are 26, 34, 43, 62, 223, 232, 322. These sum to 942, hence a(11) = 942.
%e A130975 Fifteenth 7-smooth number is 18, numbers without digit 1 and with product of digits = 18 are 29, 36, 63, 92, 233, 323, 332. These sum to 1108, hence a(15) = 1108.
%Y A130975 Cf. A002473 (7-smooth numbers), A084796 (concatenation of prime factors of n in decreasing order).
