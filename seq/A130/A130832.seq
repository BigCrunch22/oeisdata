%N A130832 Number of cubes in Menger cube constructions by levels: Sum[20^(2^n), {n, 0, m}].
%C A130832 A Sierpinski gasket has three starting states: a Sierpinski carpet has eight starting states: A Sierpinski tetrahedron has four starting states: the Menger cube has 27-7=20 starting states. This fact makes making a level four or level five Menger construction a very difficult task.
