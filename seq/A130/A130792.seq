%N A130792 Numbers n whose representation can be split in two parts which can be used as seeds for a Fibonacci-like sequence containing n itself.
%C A130792 The 6 members with two digits are also Keith numbers. There are 233 numbers below 10^6 in this sequence.
%C A130792 If the number x is rewritten as a U b, the problem is to find a value of y such that x = a*F(y) + b*F(y+1), where F(y) is a Fibonacci number (see file with values of x, a, b, y, for 1<x<10^6, in Links). All the listed numbers admit only one concatenation, a U b, that, through the addition process, leads to themselves. Is there any number that admits more than one single concatenation? [_Paolo P. Lava_, Oct 02 2014]
%C A130792 Sequence is infinite. Let us consider the numbers 19, 199, 1999, 19...9 and let us divide them as 1 U 9, 1 U 99, 1 U 999, 1 U 9...9. In two steps we have the initial numbers back: 1 + 9 = 10 and 9 + 10 = 19; 1 + 99 = 100 and 99 + 100 = 199, etc. [_Paolo P. Lava_, Oct 08 2014]
