%N A130499 a(1)=1. a(n) = number of earlier terms of the sequence which are coprime to (the sum of positive integers which are <=n and missing from first (n-1) terms of sequence).

%e A130499 The positive integers which are <= 9 and are missing from the first 8 terms of the sequence are 4,7,8,9. The sum of these integers is 28, so a(9) is the number of earlier terms which are coprime to 28. Therefore a(9) = 6.
