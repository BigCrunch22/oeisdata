%N A130320 Given n numbers n>(n-1)>(n-2)>...>2>1, adding the first and last numbers leads to the identity n+1 = (n-1)+2 = (n-2)+3 = ... In case if some positive x_1, x_2, ... are added to n, (n-1) etc, the strict inequality could be retained. This could be repeated finitely many times till it ends in inequality of form M > N where M-N is minimal. This sequence gives the value of M for different n.

%F A130320 For n of form 2^k, we have a(n) = 4a(n-1) - 2 with a(1) = 2. For n of form 2^k + 2^(k-1), a(n) = 4a(n-1) with a(1) = 4.
%e A130320 a(5) = 10 because we have 5 > 4 > 3 > 2 > 1.
%e A130320 To follow a strict inequality we would have 5 + x > 4 + y > 3 > 2 > 1, where x >= 0, y >= 0.
%e A130320 The next level of inequality gives 1 + 5 + x > 2 + 4 + y > 3. This implies x > y.
%e A130320 Continuing with next level gives 3 + 6 + x > 6 + y. This gives x = 1, y = 0.
%e A130320 Hence 10 > 6 giving a(5) = 10.
