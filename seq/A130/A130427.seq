%N A130427 Complete list of all 5 numbers n such that n is equal to the number of 5's in the decimal digits of all numbers <= n.
%e A130427 A130427(5)=40000000000 because the number of 5's in the decimal digits of the numbers from 0 to 40000000000 is 40000000000 and this is the 5th such number.
%Y A130427 Cf. A014778 for proof these sequences are finite; Also A101639, A101640, A101641, A130428, A130429, A130430, A130431; Cf. A130432 for the number of numbers in these sequences.
