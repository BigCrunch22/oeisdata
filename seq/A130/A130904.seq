%N A130904 Numbers n such that the trajectory of the map n -> (n + lpf(n)) / 2 reaches 3, where lpf(n) is the least prime factor of n (A020639).
%C A130904 The only prime term is 3 because all primes map to themselves.
%e A130904 (15 + 3) / 2 = 9, (9 + 3) / 2 = 6, (6 + 2) / 2 = 4, and (4 + 2) / 2 = 3, thus 15 is in the sequence.
%e A130904 (21 + 3) / 2 = 12, (12 + 2) / 2 = 7, and (7 + 7) / 2 = 7, so 21 never reaches 3 and therefore is not in the sequence.
%Y A130904 Cf. A177980, A020639, A061228.
