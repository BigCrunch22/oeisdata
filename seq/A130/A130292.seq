%N A130292 Numbers that are sums of fifth powers of two distinct primes.
%C A130292 This is to 5th powers as A120398 is to cubes and A130873 is to 4th powers. After a finite number of integers which cannot be written as a sum of 5th powers of primes, all integers can be so written; but no sum of exactly two fifth powers of primes is itself prime.
%F A130292 {a(n}} = {k such that k = A050997(i) + A050997(j)} = {k such that k = A000040(i)^5 + A000040(j)^5}.
%e A130292 a(1) = prime(1)^5 + prime(2)^5 = 2^5 + 3^5 = 32 + 243 = 275.
%t A130292 Select[Sort[ Flatten[Table[Prime[n]^5 + Prime[k]^5, {n, 15}, {k, n - 1}]]], # <= Prime[15^5] &]
