%N A130725 Irregular array where n-th row (of {binomial(n/floor(n/2)) - floor((n+1)/2)} terms) contains the positive integers (in order) which are < the greatest term of the n-th row of Pascal's triangle and which are not among the terms of the n-th row of Pascal's triangle.
%e A130725 The 5th row of Pascal's triangle is (1,5,10,10,5,1). The positive integers which are < than the greatest term (10) of this row and which are missing from this row are (2,3,4,6,7,8,9).
