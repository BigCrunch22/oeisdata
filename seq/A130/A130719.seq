%N A130719 a(n) = n-th digit after the decimal point of the decimal representation of the n-th harmonic number.
%H A130719 Eric Weisstein's World of Mathematics, <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HarmonicSeries.html">Harmonic Series</a>.
%e A130719 a(7) = 1 because the 7th harmonic number is 1/1+1/2+1/3+1/4+1/5+1/6+1/7 = 2.592857143... and 1 is the 7th digit after the decimal point.
