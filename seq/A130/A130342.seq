%N A130342 Row 3 of A122204.
%C A130342 The signature-permutation of the Catalan automorphism which is derived from the third non-recursive Catalan automorphism *A089850 with recursion schema ENIPS (see A122204 for the definition). This automorphism is also produced when automorphism *A069768 is applied to the right-hand side subtree of the given binary tree, with the left side left intact.

%Y A130342 Inverse: A130341. a(n) = A069770(A069768(n)). The number of cycles and the number of fixed points in range [A014137(n-1)..A014138(n-1)] of this permutation are given by A089404 and A073268. Cf. also A073287.
