%N A130295 Erroneous duplicate of A125026.
%C A130295 This sequence was initially defined as "A051340 * A007318". However, the matrix product A051340 * A007318 is not well defined, because all elements of A051340 are strictly positive integers, as are all elements of the lower left of A007318. Therefore the matrix A051340 must be truncated to its lower left (setting A[i,j]=0 if j>i), which actually equals A130296. Then the product yields this sequence, which is identical to A125026.
%C A130295 Row sums = A099035 (not A083706 as stated initially): (1, 5, 15, 39, 95, 223, 511, ...).
%F A130295 (A051340) * A007318 as infinite lower triangular matrices. [Here (A051340) is that matrix with the upper right triangle set to zero, which is actually A130296. - _M. F. Hasler_, Aug 15 2015]
