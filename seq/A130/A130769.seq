%F A130769 Let f(n) be the Collatz (3n+1) function. Let F(n) be the sequence of positive integers m s.t. f(m) is called during the execution of f(n). (So F(1) = (1); F(2) = (2, 1); F(3) = (3, 10, 5, 15, 8, 4, 2, 1); and so on.) Assume that F(n) has k terms. Then, each instance of the sequence, G(n), is generated by encoding the sequence F(n) as a positive integer as follows: G(n) = 2^F(n)_0 * 3^F(n)_1 * 5^F(n)_2 * ... * p(k-1)^F(n)_{k-1} where F(n)_i is the i-th member of the sequence F(n) and p(i) is the i-th prime.
%e A130769 G(3) = 1649253940128607650037732224082865475000
%e A130769 because given F as described above,
%e A130769 F(3) = (3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1)
%e A130769 and thus
%e A130769 G(3) = 2^3 * 3^10 * 5^5 * 7^16 * 11^8 * 13^4 * 17^2 * 19
%e A130769 = 1649253940128607650037732224082865475000.
