%N A130141 Let f denote the map that replaces k with the concatenation of its nontrivial divisors, written in decreasing order, each divisor being written in base 10 in the normal way. Then a(n) = prime reached when starting at 2n+1 and iterating f.
%C A130141 If 2n+1 is 1 or a prime, set a(n) = 2n+1. If no prime is ever reached, set a(n) = -1.
%C A130141 The value of a(17) is currently unknown.

%C A130141 If "when starting at 2n+1" in the definition were replaced by "when starting at n", all even-indexed terms except for a(2) and a(4) would be -1.
%C A130141 A simple proof is that an even number's smallest nontrivial divisor is 2, and the result of iterating f for any even number except for 2 and 4 would have factors in front, so the resulting number would be of the form 10m+2 where m is an integer greater than 1, and therefore an even number ending in 2 other than two itself, so no prime would ever be reached. (End)
%e A130141 n = 13: 2n+1 = 27 has nontrivial divisors 3 and 9, so we get 93, which has proper divisors 3 and 31, so we get 313, prime. So a(13) = 313.
