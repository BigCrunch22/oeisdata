%N A130501 a(1)=1, a(n) = number of earlier terms of the sequence that divide (the sum of positive integers which are <=n and missing from first (n-1) terms of sequence).
%e A130501 The positive integers which are <= 9 and are missing from the first 8 terms of the sequence are 3,5,6,7,8,9. The sum of these integers is 38, so a(9) is the number of earlier terms which divide 38. Therefore a(9) = 6.
