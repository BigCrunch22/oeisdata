%N A130142 Let f denote the map that replaces k with the concatenation of its nontrivial divisors, written in decreasing order, each divisor being written in base 10 with its digits in reverse order. Then a(n) = first prime reached when starting at 2n+1 and iterating f.
%C A130142 If 2n+1 is 1 or a prime, set a(n) = 2n+1. If no prime is ever reached, set a(n) = -1.
%C A130142 The value of a(17) is currently unknown.
%e A130142 n = 13: 2n+1 = 27 has nontrivial divisors 3 and 9, so we get 93, which has proper divisors 3 and 31, so we get 133.
%e A130142 Then 133 has nontrivial divisors 7 and 19, so we get 917.
%e A130142 Then 917 has nontrivial divisors 7 and 131, so we get 1317.
%e A130142 Then 1317 has nontrivial divisors 3 and 439, so we get 9343, a prime and a(13) = 9343.
%e A130142 From _Sean A. Irvine_, Sep 11 2009: (Start)
%e A130142 Proof chain for a(17). The following gives the argument to f at each step, followed by its factorization.
%e A130142 35 factors as 5 * 7.
%e A130142 75 has factors 3 * 5 * 5.
%e A130142 525153 has factors 3 * 193 * 907.
%e A130142 15057112727099753913 has factors 3 * 4463 * 17215189 * 65325353.

%e A130142 765...4892 (3249 digits) is divisible by 2, and hence all subsequent steps will be divisible by 2, therefore no prime is ever reached, therefore a(17)=-1. (End)
