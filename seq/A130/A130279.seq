%F A130279 From _Bernard Schott_, Oct 01 2022: (Start)
%F A130279 a(n) = A005179(n)^2.
%F A130279 Proof: Suppose a(n) = Product p_i^(2*e_i), where the p_i are primes. Then the n square divisors are all of the form d = Product p_i^(2*k_i) with 0 <= k_i <= e_i. As a(n) = Product (p_i^e_i)^2 = (Product (p_i^e_i))^2, we get that sqrt(a(n)) = Product (p_i^e_i). This is the prime decomposition of sqrt(a(n)). As there is a bijection between prime factors p_i^(2*k_i) and (p_i^k_i), there is also bijection between square divisors of a(n) and divisors of sqrt(a(n)). We conclude that sqrt(a(n)) is the smallest integer that has exactly n divisors. (End)
