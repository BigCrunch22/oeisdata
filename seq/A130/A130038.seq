%N A130038 Even numbers n such that n-7 is prime, but neither n-3 nor n-5 is prime.
%C A130038 Even numbers that are the sum of 7 and another prime number, but not the sum of 3 or 5 plus another prime.

%e A130038 30-7 is prime but 30-3 and 30-5 are not. Therefore 30 is in the sequence.
%e A130038 90-7 = 83 is prime, but neither 90-3 = 87 nor 90-5= 85 is prime, hence 90 is a term.
%e A130038 88-7 = 81 is not prime, hence 88 is not in the sequence.
%e A130038 86-7 = 79 is prime and 86-3 = 83 is also prime, hence 86 is not in the sequence.
%e A130038 78-7 = 71 is prime and 78-5 = 73 is also prime, hence 78 is not in the sequence.
