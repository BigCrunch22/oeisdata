%N A130024 a(1)=1. a(n) = number of earlier terms which don't have 2 or more distinct prime divisors in common with n.
%C A130024 If n is in A354144 then a(n) = n-1. - _Robert Israel_, Oct 20 2024

%e A130024 The distinct primes which divide 20 are 2 and 5. So a(20) is the number of earlier terms which are not divisible by at least 2 distinct primes dividing 20; i.e. are not divisible by both 2 and 5. Among the first 19 terms only a(11)=10 and a(12)=10 are divisible by both 2 and 5. There are 17 other earlier terms, so a(20)=17.
