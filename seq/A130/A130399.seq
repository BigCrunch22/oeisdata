%N A130399 Two consecutive terms share no digit with their difference.
%C A130399 The sequence is constructed to be as long as possible and increasing as slowly as possible - thus the next term after 29 is not 30 (because there is no term after 30, as any number m>30 shares its last digit with m-30; we then add 4 to 29, instead of 1, reaching 33).
%C A130399 Though the sequence is increasing as slowly as possible and constructed to be as long as possible, it will end. Last term?
