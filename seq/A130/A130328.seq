%N A130328 Triangle of differences between powers of 2, read by rows.
%C A130328 A130321 * A059268 as infinite lower triangular matrices.
%C A130328 Row sums = A000337: (1, 5, 17, 49, 129, 321, ...). A130329 = A059268 * A130321.
%C A130328 From _Alonso del Arte_, Mar 13 2008: (Start)
%C A130328 Column 0 contains the Mersenne numbers A000225.
%C A130328 Column 1 is A000918.
%C A130328 An even perfect number (A000396) is found in the triangle by reference to its matching exponent for the Mersenne prime p (A000043) thus: go to row 2p - 1 and then column p - 1 (remembering that the first position is column 0).
%C A130328 Likewise divisors of multiply perfect numbers, if not the multiply perfect numbers themselves, can also be found in this triangle. (End)
%F A130328 t(n, k) = 2^n - 2^k, where n is the row number and k is the column number, running from 0 to n - 1. (If k is allowed to reach n, then the triangle would have an extra diagonal filled with zeros) - _Alonso del Arte_, Mar 13 2008
%e A130328 First few rows of the triangle are;

%e A130328   ...
%e A130328 a(5, 2) = 28 because 2^5 = 32, 2^2 = 4 and 32 - 4 = 28.
