%N A073819 a(n) = prime(i) such that prime(i)*(n+1-i) is maximized (1 <= i <= n).
%C A073819 3 is the only n for which the maximum is not unique; a(3) could also be given as 3.
%F A073819 a(n) = A073818(n)/A073820(n).
%e A073819 For n = 5, we take the first 5 primes in ascending order and multiply them by the numbers from 5 to 1 in descending order: 2*5 = 10 3*4 = 12 5*3 = 15 7*2 = 14 11*1 = 11 The largest product is 15, so a(5) = 5.
