%N A073361 Nested floor product of n and fractions (k+1)/k for all k>0 (mod 4), divided by 4.
%F A073361 a(n)=(1/3)[...[[[[n(2/1)](3/2)](4/3)](6/5)]...(k+1)/k]..., k>0 (mod 4), where [x] = floor of x; this infinite nested floor product will eventually level-off at a(n).
%e A073361 a(1)=1 since (1/4)[[[[1(2/1)](3/2)](4/3)](6/5)]=(1/4)[4(6/5)]=1
