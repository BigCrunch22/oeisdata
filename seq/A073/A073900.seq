%N A073900 a(1) = 1; then k-th prime prime(k) followed by Floor[e^k] consecutive composite numbers not occurring earlier.
%C A073900 Primes grow faster than composites. Question: For what (the smallest) value of m a(m) is prime and more than the previous term which is obviously composite.?
%e A073900 a(2) =2 and Floor[e] = 2 hence a(3) and a(4) are 4 and 6 respectively. a(5) = 3 (the second prime) and Floor[e^2]=7, hence next 7 terms are 8,9,10,12,14,15 and 16.
