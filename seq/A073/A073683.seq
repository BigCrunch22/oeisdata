%N A073683 Group the primes such that the sum of each group is a prime. Each group from the second onwards should contain at least 3 primes: (2, 3), (5, 7, 11), (13, 17, 19, 23, 29), (31, 37, 41), (43, 47, 53, 59, 61), ... This is the sequence of the leading element in each group.
%C A073683 First prime of n-th group of successive primes in A073684.
%e A073683 Partition the sequence of primes into groups so that the sum of the terms in each group is prime: {2, 3}, {5, 7, 11}, {13, 17, 19, 23, 29}, {31, 37, 41}, {43, 47, 53, 59, 61}, {67, 71, 73}, {79, 83, 89}, {97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127}, {131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173}, {179, 181, 191, 193, 197},..; A073684(n) is the number of terms in n-th group; A073682(n) is the sum of terms in n-th group; a(n) is the first term in n-th group; A077279(n) is the last term in n-th group.
