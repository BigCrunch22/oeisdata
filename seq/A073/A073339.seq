%N A073339 Define b(k) by the recursion b(1)=n, b(k+1)=b(k)-trunc(k/b(k)), where trunc(x) is floor(x) for x>=0, ceiling(x) for x<0. Sequence gives the value a(n) such that b(a(n))=0; if k>a(n) then b(k) is undefined.
%C A073339 By definition a(n)>n. Conjecture: a(n) is always defined. Often the b sequences for two values of n merge and a(n) is the same for both values. So some numbers, such as 69, 631, 1167 and 689027, occur in the sequence more often than others.
%C A073339 Is sum(k=1,n,a(k))/(n^2*log(n)) bounded?
