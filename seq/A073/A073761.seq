%N A073761 Primitive numbers whose decimal expansion of 1/n is equidistributed in base 10.
%C A073761 Usually once a number has the desired property, so do all its multiples. However there are exceptions. 61*7 in base 10 is not equidistributed. Multiples of earlier numbers are not included here.
%C A073761 From _Jianing Song_, Jul 29 2022: (Start)
%C A073761 There are 58 composite terms below 100000, 2 among which being even: a(239) = 25064 = 2^3 * 13 * 241, and a(613) = 72728 = 2^3 * 9091.
%C A073761 Conjecture 1: let p be a prime such that ord(10,p) is a multiple of 10, where ord(a,m) denotes the multiplicative order of a modulo m. Then p is a term if and only if 10 is a primitive root modulo p.
%C A073761 Conjecture 2: suppose that m is a term with bigomega(m) = 2, then m = p*q, where p == 1 (mod 10), q == 9 (mod 10), gcd(p-1,q-1) = 2, ord(10,p) = (p-1)/2, and ord(10,q) = q-1. Note that the converse is not true, though.
%C A073761 There are no counterexamples to the conjectures above below 100000.
%C A073761 Is there any odd term m such that bigomega(m) > 2? (End)

%e A073761 61 is a term because 1/61 = .016393... (period 60 digits, 6 of each 0,1,..9).
