%N A073770 Primes p not of the form q + s where q is prime and s > 0 is the smallest square such that q + s is prime.
%C A073770 A065377 is a subsequence of this sequence. Except for the initial term 2 this sequence is disjoint to A073609.
%e A073770 13 cannot be partitioned into a prime and a square > 0, so 13 is a term. The only partition of 19 into a prime and a square > 0 is (3,16), but 16 is not the smallest square s such that 3 + s is prime since 3 + 4 = 7 is also prime; therefore 19 is a term.
