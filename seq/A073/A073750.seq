%N A073750 Factors of 2 in the denominators of the fractional coefficients of the square-root of the prime power series: sum_{n=0..inf} p_n x^n, where p_n is the n-th prime and p_0 is defined to be 1.
%C A073750 Are all the denominators exact powers of 2?
%F A073750 Convolution of sum_{n=0..inf} A073749(n)/[D_n*2^{a(n)}] x^n yields the prime power series sum_{n=0..inf} p_n x^n, where p_n is the n-th prime and p_0=1 and where D_n is a positive integer; D_n for the first 60 terms is 1 (is it always equal to 1?).
