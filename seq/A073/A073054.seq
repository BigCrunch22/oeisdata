%N A073054 Number of applications of DENEAT operator x -> A073053(x) needed to transform n to 123.
%C A073054 0 first occurs for n=123, 1 first occurs for n=101, 2 first occurs for n=0, 3 first occurs for n=20, 4 first occurs for n=11, 5 first occurs for n=1. What is the least n such that a(n) > 5? - _Jason Earls_, Jun 03 2005 (Corrected by _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 12 2019)
%C A073054 Since each string has only finitely many preimages under this map, the sequence is unbounded. Compare A100961. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jun 18 2005
