%N A073608 a(1) = 1, a(n) = smallest number such that a(n) - a(n-k) is a prime power > 1 for all k.
%C A073608 Differences |a(i)-a(j)| are prime powers for all i,j. Conjecture: sequence is bounded.
%C A073608 Proof that sequence is complete: Assume there is some k after the term 12. Then {k-1, k-3, k-5} must contain a multiple of 3. Also {k-8,k-10,k-12} also contains a multiple of 3. No prime > 12 is a multiple of 3, so the multiples of 3 are both prime powers. This implies there must be two powers of 3 that have a difference at most 11, but no such pair exists > 12 (only 1,3 and 3,9 qualify.) - _Jim Nastos_, Aug 09 2002
%C A073608 There is an elementary proof that no set of seven integers of this kind exists. - _Don Reble_, Aug 10 2002
