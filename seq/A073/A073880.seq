%C A073880 a(57) is likely to be the last term. - _Scott R. Shannon_, Oct 07 2024
%C A073880 From _Robert Israel_, Oct 07 2024: (Start)
%C A073880 Proof that a(57) is the last term.
%C A073880 Sum_{i=1..57} a(i) = 91899819.  Suppose r is a palindrome not in {a(1),...,a(56)} such that 91899819 + r is a palindrome.
%C A073880 It has been checked that r must have more digits than 91899819 does.
%C A073880 r can't end in 0 because it's a palindrome. If r ends (and therefore starts) with digit x, then r + 91899819 ends (and starts) with x-1.
%C A073880 But since r + 91899819 > r, that can only happen if r + 91899819 has one more digit than r.
%C A073880 Since r has more digits than 91899819, this implies that r + 91899819 starts with 1 and r starts with 9.
%C A073880 But that's impossible because 9 + 9 ends in 8. (End)
