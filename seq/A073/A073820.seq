%N A073820 a(n) = n+1-i such that prime(i)*(n+1-i) is maximized (1 <= i <= n).
%C A073820 3 is the only n for which the maximum is not unique; a(3) could also be given as 2.
%F A073820 a(n) = A073818(n)/A073819(n).
%e A073820 For n = 5, we take the first 5 primes in ascending order and multiply them by the numbers from 5 to 1 in descending order: 2*5 = 10 3*4 = 12 5*3 = 15 7*2 = 14 11*1 = 11 The largest product is 15, so a(5) = 3.
