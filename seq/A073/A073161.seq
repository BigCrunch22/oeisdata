%N A073161 Nested floor product of n and fractions (p_k + 1)/p_k where p_k is k-th prime.
%C A073161 Sequence consists only of composite numbers.
%F A073161 a(n) = [...[[[n*(1+1/2)]*(1+1/3)]*(1+1/5)]...*(1+1/p_k)]..., where [x] = floor of x and p_k is the k-th prime; this infinite nested floor product will eventually level-off at a(n). Alternatively, for n>=1, let b(0, n)=n and b(k, n) = floor( b(k-1, n)*(1 + 1/p_k) ), for k=1..m, then a(n)=b(m, n) where m is smallest integer such that p_m > a(n).
%e A073161 a(4) = 10 since [[[[4*(1+1/2)]*(1+1/3)]*(1+1/5)]*(1+1/7)] = [[[6*(1+1/3)]*(1+1/5)]*(1+1/7)] = [[8*(1+1/5)]*(1+1/7)] = [9*(1+1/7)] = 10.
