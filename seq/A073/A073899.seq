%C A073899 Primes grow faster than composites. Question: For what (the smallest) value of m is a(m) prime and bigger than the previous term which is obviously composite? Answer: There is no such m. Proof: Assume a(m) is the n-th prime and a(m-1) < a(m). Checking manually gives n>10. Then a(m) < 2*n*log(n). The number of composite numbers appearing before a(m) is apparently the sum of the first n-1 primes, which is bigger than (n-1)^2. This means that a(m-1) is definitely bigger than (n-1)^2. Therefore we have a(m) < 2*n*log(n) as well as a(m-1) > (n-1)^2. Therefore a(m-1) > a(m).
