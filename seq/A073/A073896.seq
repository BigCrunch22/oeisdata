%N A073896 a(1) = 1, a(n) = a(n-1) + k where k is smallest prime or composite number not used earlier according as a(n-1) is nonprime or prime.
%e A073896 a(2) = 1+2 = 3 which is prime hence a(3) = 3+4 = 7 which is also a prime,a(4)= 7+6 = 13 which is also prime hence a(5) = 13 + 8 = 21, composite hence a(6) =21+ 3= 24.
