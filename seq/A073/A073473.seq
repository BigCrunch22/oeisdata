%N A073473 Primes (including 1) forming 3 X 3 magic square with prime entries and minimal constant 111 = A073502(3).
%C A073473 Until the early part of the twentieth century 1 was regarded as a prime (cf. A008578).
%C A073473 "The problem of constructing magic squares with prime numbers only was first discussed by myself in The Weekly Dispatch for Jul 22 1900 and Aug 05 1900; but during the last three or four years it has received great attention from American mathematicians. First, they have sought to form these squares with the smallest possible constants.
%C A073473 "Thus the first nine prime numbers, 1 to 23 inclusive, sum to 99, which (being divisible by 3) is theoretically a suitable series; yet it has been demonstrated that the smallest possible constant is 111 and the required series as follows: 1,7,13,31,37,43,61,67,73." - Dudeney
%C A073473 See A024351 for the "modern" version of the minimal 3 X 3 magic square of primes. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 30 2018
