%N A073672 Rearrangement of natural numbers such that sum of n (n>1) terms starting from the n-th term (included) is a prime.
%C A073672 Every 2k-th term is the smallest number which has not been included earlier.
%e A073672 a(1) = 2, a(2)=1, 1+4 = 5 which is prime; a(3) = 4, 4+3+6 = 13 which is prime; a(4) = 3, 3+6+5+9 = 23 which is prime; etc.
