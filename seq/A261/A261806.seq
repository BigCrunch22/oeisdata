%N A261806 a(n) = Sum from "least x such that prime(x) has n digits" to "the number of primes with n digits" of the difference between prime(k) and k.
%F A261806 a(n) = Sum_{k=A090226(n)..A006879(n)} prime(k)-k
%e A261806 As 2, 3, 5, and 7 are the only primes less than 10, A006879(1) = 4 and as 1 is the least number such that prime(1) has 1 digit, A090226(1) = 1. Therefore a(1) = Sum_{k=1..4} prime(k)-k = (2-1) + (3-2) + (5-3) + (7-4) = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7.
