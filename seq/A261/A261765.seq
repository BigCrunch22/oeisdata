%N A261765 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of subpermutations of an n-set, whose orbits are each of size at most k with at least one orbit of size exactly k, and without fixed points. Equivalently, T(n,k) is the number of partial derangements of an n-set each of whose orbits is of size at most k with at least one orbit of size exactly k, and without fixed points.
%C A261765 T(n,n) is A261766. Sum of rows is A144085.

%F A261765 T(n,k) = A261762(n,k) - A261762(n,k-1).
%e A261765 T(n,1) = 0 because there is no (partial) derangement with an orbit of size 1.
%e A261765 T(3,2) = 9 because there are 9 subpermutations on {1,2,3}, whose orbits are each of size at most 2 with at least one orbit of size exactly 2, and without fixed points, namely: (1 2 --> 2 1), (1 3 --> 3 1), (2 3 --> 3 2), (1-->2), (1-->3), (2-->1), (2-->3), (3-->1), (3-->2).
