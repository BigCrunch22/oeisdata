%N A261987 Triangle read by rows: row n lists the set of n coprime composite numbers that minimizes the difference between first and last terms, and then minimizes the average of the terms.
%C A261987 The minimal set of the (k+n)th row is determined by the minimal k-tuple coprime to the n-th primorial, where every prime <= to the n-th prime must be a factor of some number in the set. E.g., the sixth row must consist of numbers congruent to 5, 7, 11 and 13 mod 6, as well as one term with a factor of 2 and another with a factor of 3.
%C A261987 In cases where multiple k-tuples satisfy the definition, the lexicographically earliest solution is chosen.
