%N A261488 Number of triples (x, y, x mod y) such that x > y are divisors of n and x mod y is an anti-divisor of n.
%C A261488 An anti-divisor of n is a number d in the range [2,n-1] which does not divide n and is either a (necessarily odd) divisor of 2n-1 or 2n+1, or a (necessarily even) divisor of 2n.
%C A261488 a(n) = 0 if n is a prime power.

%e A261488 a(45) = 2 with triples (5, 3, 5 mod 3) and (15, 9, 15 mod 9) since 3, 5, 9, and 15 are divisors of 45 and 5 mod 3 = 2 and 15 mod 9 = 6 are anti-divisors of 45.
