%e A261160 The sequence cannot start with a(1) = 0 (which would require to start with 0 digits different from '0', contradiction) nor with a(1) = 1 (which would require to have a(2) = 0 and thus a chunk of 0 digits different from '0' after a(2), i.e., have a(3) start with another digit '0', which is impossible).
%e A261160 Thus, a(1) = 2.
%e A261160 Hence, a(2) starts with a nonzero digit, which must be followed by a digit '0'. It is indeed possible to choose a(2) = 1 and a(3) = 0.
%e A261160 Then must follow one nonzero digit and two consecutive digits '0'. Since the term 0 cannot appear for a second time, the "least" way to achieve this is to use a(4) = 100.
%e A261160 Then must follow 100 nonzero digits, viz the zeroless numbers from a(5) = 3 to a(57) = 61, followed by a(58) = 10.
%e A261160 From there on, to produce the zeroless chunks of length 3, 4, 5, ..., the lexico-first choice is 62, 20; 63, 110; 64, 65, 30; 66, 67, 120; and so on.
%Y A261160 Cf. A261161 - A261169 for the variants which use digit '1', ..., '9' as delimiter.
