%N A261834 Number of n-step adjacent expansions on the hexagonal (honeycomb) lattice. Holes allowed.
%C A261834 Initially only one cell C[0] is occupied on the lattice.
%C A261834 Then, for each i of (1..n), C[i] is chosen among the free cells adjacent to at least one of (C[0],...,C[i-1]).
%C A261834 a(n) is the number of distinct (C[1],...,C[n]).
%H A261834 Francois Alcover, <a href="/A261834/a261834.png">tree</a>.
%e A261834 a(1) = 6 because a point has 6 neighbors on the hexagonal grid.
%e A261834 a(2) = 48 = a(1) * 8 because a two-cell group has 8 free neighbors.
%Y A261834 Cf. A007846 (same principle but on the rectangular lattice).
%Y A261834 Cf. A001334.
