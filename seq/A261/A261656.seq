%N A261656 Numbers with 3 prime factors a < b < c such that 2c = a^4 + b^2 and a = round(sqrt(b)).
%C A261656 This sequence is interesting because the sequence of any member's divisors increases approximately exponentially, without members having any repeated prime factors.
%C A261656 Removing the limitation a=round(sqrt(b)) results in A261657.
%C A261656 This sequence would be particularly interesting if the b and c of one member were the a and b of another, as it could give us a number with 4 prime factors and similar properties as here. The resulting compound would be a member of A261658. No such pairs exist in this sequence with any lowest factor < 10000.

%e A261656 The prime factors of 3333 are 3, 11, and 101. 3^4=81, 11^2=121, and the average of 81 and 121 gives 101. Thus, 3333 is a member.
%e A261656 The divisors of 3333 are 1, 3, 11, 33, 101, 303, 1111, 3333. This sequence is approximately exponential.
