%N A060033 Successive sizes of membership in the United Nations.
%C A060033 The United Nations Organization was founded in 1945 by 51 states; the number is updated when members enter or leave. So in 1946 they became 55, 57 in 1947, 58 in 1948, 59 in 1949 and in 1950 there were 60 members. On the other hand between 1951 - 1954 nothing happened, so there is no new entry until 1955 when the membership jumped to 76.
