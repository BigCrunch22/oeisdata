%N A060198 Dimensions of graded algebra associated with forest meanders.
%C A060198 Number of meander slices with 2n crossings which can be open on both sides and whose loops are all even. A loop is even if it has its least point at an even index with crossings numbered from zero. This definition excludes slices such as (open, open, close, close) since the inner loop is not even. It also excludes (up, open, close, down) even though the loop is not contained in another. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Feb 07 2025
