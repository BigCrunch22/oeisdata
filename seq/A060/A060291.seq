%N A060291 Number of twin Harshads, including overlaps, whose sum is prime and where the 2nd Harshad is <= 10^n.
%F A060291 Generate the twin Harshads whose sum is prime. Count how many there are where the 2nd Harshad in the pair is <= to a consecutive power of 10.
%e A060291 a(1)=7 because there are 7 pairs of Harshads whose sum is prime and the 2nd Harshad in the pair is <= 10; these are 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+4=7, 5+6=11, 6+7=13, 8+9=17, 9+10=19. (Another sequence does not permit overlapping Harshad numbers.)
