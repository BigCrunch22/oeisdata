%N A117986 Number of functions f:[n]->[n] such that f[(x*y) mod n]=[f(x)*f(y)] mod n for all x,y in [n], for n=1,2,3,... Here [n] denotes {0,1,2,...,n-1}.
%C A117986 If, instead, the modular functional equation f[(x+y) mod n]=[f(x)+f(y)] mod n is considered, it is found that for each n=1,2,3,... there appears to be exactly n functions with the desired property. See A117987 and A117988 for results on other modular functional equations.

%F A117986 Apparently, a(p) = p + 1 for any prime number p. - _Rémy Sigrist_, Sep 19 2019
%e A117986 For n=5 the six functions are (0,0,0,0,0), (0,1,1,1,1), (1,1,1,1,1), (0,1,4,4,1), (0,1,3,2,4), (0,1,2,3,4). For the 5th of these, (0,1,3,2,4), the x=2, y=3 case is verified by the calculations f(2*3 mod 4) = f(1) = 1 and f(2)*f(3) mod 5 = 3*2 mod 5 = 1.
