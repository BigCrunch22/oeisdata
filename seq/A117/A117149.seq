%N A117149 Trajectory of 4 under map k -> A094077(k).
%C A117149 Permutation A094077 has fixed point 1, 2-cycle (2,3) and 5-cycle (14,23,16,27,19); there are no other finite cycles with terms < 500000. 4 is the smallest number that is not member of a known finite cycle of A094077.
%C A117149 Conjecture: Sequence is not periodic.
%C A117149 For the retrograde trajectory of 4 see A117150.
