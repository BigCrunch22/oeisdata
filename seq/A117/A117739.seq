%N A117739 Decimal expansion of the largest C_0 = 1.2209864... such that for C < C_0 and A < 2 the sequence a(n) = floor[A^(C^n)] can't contain only prime terms.
%C A117739 It is not proved that for C > C_0 the mentioned infinite sequence of primes actually exists. However, heuristics show that A243358 could be infinite (the decimal expansion of corresponding A value is A243370).
