%N A117179 Riordan array ((1-x^2)/(1+x^2)^2,x/(1+x^2)).
%C A117179 Inverse is A117178. Row sums are (-1)^n*A098554(n+1). Diagonal sums are 1,0,-2,0,2,0,-2,... with g.f. (1-x^2)/(1+x^2).
%C A117179 Apparently, with the rows de-aerated and then reversed, this matrix becomes signed A034807 with the twos on the diagonal removed. Apparently, |D(2n,k+1)| = |D(2(n-1),k+1)| + |D(2n,k)| where D(n,k) is the k-th element on the n-th diagonal. - _Tom Copeland_, May 30 2017
