%N A117885 Numbers n such that a regular (n^3-n)-gon can be constructed by means of a ruler and compass.
%C A117885 Gauss shows a regular n-gon can be constructed (with Euclidean tools) iff n is a product of 2^k*(distinct Fermat primes).
%F A117885 n^3 - n = (n-1)*n*(n+1).
%e A117885 a(1)=2 because 2^3 - 2 = 6 = 1*2*3, and a regular hexagon can be constructed by ruler and compass.
%o A117885 (PARI) for(n=1, 10^4, nn= n^3-n; my(t=eulerphi(nn)); if(t/2^valuation(t, 2)==1, print1(n, ", "))); \\ after PARI in A003401; _Michel Marcus_, Oct 11 2017
