%N A117370 Number of primes between smallest prime divisor of n and largest prime divisor of n.
%C A117370 This sequence first differs from sequence A117371 at the 30th term.
%C A117370 Records in a(n) are for n = 2*prime(k), for which a(n) = k-2. Examples: a(14) = a(2*prime(4)) = 4-2 = 2; a(22) = a(2*prime(5)) = 5-2 = 3; a(26) = a(2*prime(6)) = 6-2 = 4; a(74) = a(2*prime(12)) = 12-2= 10. Those records are each repeated for n = 2*(prime(k)^e_1)*(prime(m)^e_2)*(prime(n)^e_3)...*(prime(x)^e_y) where e_i are positive integers and prime(m), ..., prime(x) are between 2 and prime(k). Minima a(n) = 0 iff least spf(n)=gpf(n) iff n is 1 or a prime power (A000961), or a product of powers of consecutive primes (prime(k)^e_1)*(prime(k+1)^e_2). Here gpf(n) = greatest prime factor = A006530(n) and spf(n) = smallest prime factor = A020639(n). - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Mar 11 2006

%F A117370 If A001221(n)<=1, a(n) = 0, otherwise a(n) = A243055(n) - 1 = (A061395(n)-A055396(n))-1. - _Antti Karttunen_, Sep 10 2018
%e A117370 a(30) is 1 because there is one prime (which is 3) between the smallest prime dividing 30 (which is 2) and the largest prime dividing 30 (which is 5).
