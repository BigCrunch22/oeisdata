%N A117759 Decimal expansion of a certain constant (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A117759 Fanfolding the triangles defined by the spiral of Theodorus, each successive hypotenuse converges to a limit which divides the angle Pi/4 of the first triangle. The ratio of the limit angle to Pi/4 is 0.5721501037... = -(Sum_{n>=1} (-1)^n*arctan(1/sqrt(n))) / (Pi/4) The index n starts at 1 for the first triangle (Pi/4) and counts triangles.
%C A117759 I have developed an algorithm to compute the alternating sum, which converges quite slowly. I have computed a value to the precision limit of 64-bit floating point, which is about 14 decimal places. The execution time is about one second. It is unclear whether the algorithm readily adapts to arbitrary precision calculation software in a usable way. There are related sequences: the actual convergent angle in degrees, or radians, etc. as well as a whole family of similarly defined convergents. Other than general treatments of the spiral of Theodorus, no references are known.
%C A117759 Using the sumalt() function in PARI allows one to find as many terms as desired (see PARI program). - _Joerg Arndt_, Jan 05 2011
