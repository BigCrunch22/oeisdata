%N A117145 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of partitions of n into parts of the form 2^j-1, j=1,2,... and having k parts (n>=1, k>=1). Partitions into parts of the form 2^j-1, j=1,2,... are called s-partitions.
%C A117145 Row sums yield A000929. sum(k*T(n,k),k=1..n)=A117146(n).

%F A117145 G.f.: G(t,x) = -1+1/product(1-tx^(2^k-1), k=1..infinity).
%e A117145 T(9,3)=2 because we have [7,1,1] and [3,3,3].
%p A117145 g:=-1+1/product(1-t*x^(2^k-1),k=1..10): gser:=simplify(series(g,x=0,20)): for n from 1 to 19 do P[n]:=sort(coeff(gser,x^n)) od: for n from 1 to 19 do seq(coeff(P[n],t^j),j=1..n) od; # yields sequence in triangular form
