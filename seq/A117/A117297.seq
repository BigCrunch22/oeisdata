%N A117297 Triangle read by rows generated from the Narayana transform.
%C A117297 The operation used in generating the triangle is analogous to the binomial transform operation used in generating triangle A058127.
%F A117297 Let a(1) = 1, then n-th row is generated by performing the operation (M * V) on the (n-1)-th row and extracting the first n terms. M = the Narayana triangle of A001263 considered as a transform. V = the (n-1)-th row of the triangle as a Vector, V; followed by zeros: [a, b, c, 0, 0, 0, ...].
%e A117297 4th row = (1, 3, 11, 37), the first four terms of M * V = (1, 3, 11, 37, 101, 231, 463, ...); where M = the Narayana triangle as an infinitely lower triangular matrix and V = the Vector formed by row 3: [1, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0, ...].
