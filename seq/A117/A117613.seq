%N A117613 The number of 3D configurations of a labeled size 2*n "wurfel". A wurfel consists of a series of cubes held together on a looped string such that the string makes a right angle inside each cube. Ignoring the labels would make a wurfel a special kind of polycube in which the cubes can be cyclically ordered at consecutive right angles (equivalently, avoiding 3 consecutive collinear cubes).
%C A117613 a(2)=1 since a loop of 2*2=4 labeled cubes has only 1 possible 3D shape. A C program for computing the sequence is available on request.
%C A117613 Richard Gordon from the University of Manitoba (GordonR(AT)ms.umanitoba.ca) first raised the question of how many wurfels there are.
