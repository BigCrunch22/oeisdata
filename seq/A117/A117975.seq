%N A117975 Triangle where a(1,1)=1; a(n,m) = number of positive integers which are missing from row (n-1) of the triangle, are <= n and are coprime to m.
%e A117975 Row 5 of the triangle is [3,2,2,2,2]. There are 4 positive integers (1,4,5,6) which are coprime to 1, are <= 6 and are not among the terms of row 5. There are 2 positive integers (1,5) which are <= 6, are coprime to 2 and are not among the terms of row 5. ...(Skipping over the m = 3, 4 and 5 cases.) There are 2 positive integer (1,5) which are <= 6, are coprime to 6 and do not occur in row 5.
%e A117975 So row 6 is [4,2,3,2,3,2].
