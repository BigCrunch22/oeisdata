%N A117622 Minesweeper sequence: a(n) is the first nonprime number, k, not occurring previously in the sequence nor the absolute value of its first forward difference among the first differences and a(1)=1.
%C A117622 Let there be mines under prime numbers in the sequence of natural numbers (on the number line). A man starts from 1 and moves on the line to cover all composite numbers once. He can take a jump of length k only once for every k. He can jump to either side. He moves so that he gives priority to touch the smallest composite number not covered earlier.
%C A117622 Does every composite number get touched?
%e A117622 Beginning with 1 he takes a jump of 3 to touch 4 then a jump of 2 to touch 6, then a jump of 4 to touch 10 then a jump of 1 in the other direction to touch 9 and so on.
%t A117622 f[s_] := Block[{k = 2, d = Abs[Most@s - Rest@s], l = Last@s}, While[ PrimeQ[k] || MemberQ[s, k] || MemberQ[d, Abs[l - k]], k++ ]; Append[s, k]]; Nest[f, {1}, 66] (* _Robert G. Wilson v_ *)
%Y A117622 Cf. A117623 (values of k), A081145 (if nothing is mined).
