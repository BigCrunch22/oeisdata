%N A117670 Triangle read by rows: partial sums of the Pascal triangle minus 1.
%C A117670 Imagine that you are in a building with floors starting at floor 1, the lowest floor and you have a large number of eggs. For each floor in the building, you want to know whether or not an egg dropped from that floor will break.
%C A117670 If an egg breaks when dropped from floor i, then all eggs are guaranteed to break when dropped from any floor j > i. Likewise, if an egg doesn't break when dropped from floor i, then all eggs are guaranteed to never break when dropped from any floor j <= i.
%C A117670 a(n,k) is the maximum number of floors where you can determine whether or not an egg will break when dropped from any floor, with the following restrictions: you may drop a maximum of n eggs (one at a time, from any floors of your choosing) and you may break a maximum of k eggs.
%C A117670 Each row of the triangle is the running sum of the corresponding row with the first 1 omitted of Pascal's triangle (A007318), see A008949, A054143, A193820.
%C A117670 The k-th entry in the n-th row is the number of possible combinations of on/off switches after k attempts to turn on a switch in a set of n distinguishable switches. An attempt to turn on the same switch twice does not result in a new combination. See example. - _Sergei Viznyuk_, Jun 24 2012
%C A117670 T(n,k) is the number of nonempty subsets of the n-set with at most k elements, see example. - _Joerg Arndt_, May 04 2014

%e A117670 For example, we have n=3 distinguishable switches A,B,C (third row above). We attempt k=2 times to turn on a switch at random. The possible resulting combinations are:
%e A117670 A=on, B=off, C=off (the same A switch was turned on 2 times)
%e A117670 A=off, B=on, C=off (the same B switch was turned on 2 times)
%e A117670 A=off, B=off, C=on (the same C switch was turned on 2 times)
%e A117670 A=on, B=on, C=off  (switches A and B were turned on)
%e A117670 A=on, B=off, C=on  (switches A and C were turned on)
%e A117670 A=off, B=on, C=on  (switches B and C were turned on)
%e A117670 Thus, we have 6 different combinations, which is the number 6 at row n=3 column k=2 in the sequence above.
