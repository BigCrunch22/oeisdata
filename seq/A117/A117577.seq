%N A117577 Equal divisions of the octave with nondecreasing consistency levels.
%C A117577 An equal temperament is consistent at level N (odd integer) if all the intervals in the N-limit tonality diamond (set of ratios with odd factors of numerator and denominator not exceeding N) are approximated consistently, i.e. the composition of the approximations is the closest approximation of the composition.

%e A117577 3-EDO is consistent through the 5 limit because 6/5, 5/4 and 4/3 map to 1 step and 3/2, 8/5 and 5/3 map to 2 steps and all the compositions work out, for example 6/5 * 5/4 = 3/2 and 1 step + 1 step = 2 steps. It is not consistent through the 7 limit because 8/7 and 7/6 both map to 1 step, but 8/7 * 7/6 = 4/3 also maps to 1 step.
