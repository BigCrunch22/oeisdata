%N A117770 Fibonacci numbers for which the product of the digits is also a Fibonacci number.
%C A117770 A000045 INTERSECT A011540 is a subsequence. As a consequence of Carmichael's theorem, the product of the digits of terms in the sequence must be in the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 21, 144} and if a term is zeroless (A052382), then at most 6 digits are not equal to 1. Conjecture: all terms > 21 have a 0 digit, i.e. is a member of A011540. - _Chai Wah Wu_, Mar 12 2016

%e A117770 21 is in the sequence because (1)it is a Fibonacci number and (2)the product of its digits 2*1=2 is also a Fibonacci number.
