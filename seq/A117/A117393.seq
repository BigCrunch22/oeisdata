%S A117393 1,2,15,65,190,447
%N A117393 Number of different classes of entangling power of permutation matrices of dimension d^2, acting on a d X d (tensor product) Hilbert space.
%C A117393 a(1), a(2) and a(3) were obtained via an exhaustive search; Lower bounds on a(4) through a(10) are 65, 190, 447, 890, 1603, 2675, 4200. - _Lieven Clarisse_, Jan 29 2017
%C A117393 I moved a(4)-a(6) back to the data field, even though they have not been proved. If they are deleted the sequence melts away. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 31 2017

%E A117393 Moved terms a(4) and above to comments since those were not obtained via an exhaustive search (but believed to be correct). - _Lieven Clarisse_, Jan 29 2017. I restored a(4)-a(6), see note above. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 31 2017
