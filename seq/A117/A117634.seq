%N A117634 a(0)=0. a(n) = a(n-1) + 1 + (number of positive integers which are <= n and are missing from {a(0),a(1),a(2),...a(n-1)}).
%e A117634 The sequence of positive integers not in this sequence begins 1, 3, 5, 6, 8,...
%e A117634 Because there are four such terms <= 7, then a(7) = a(6) + 1 + 4 = 24.
