%N A117969 Start of least run of maximal length of consecutive n-almost primes.
%C A117969 For n>=2 there cannot be more than 2^n - 1 consecutive n-almost primes. Is it known whether there always exists such a run of length 2^n - 1? If not, I conjecture so. This is confirmed to be true for terms through a(4). Terms here equal the last terms of corresponding finite sequences: a(3) = A067813(6). a(4) was computed by _Don Reble_ as A067814(14). a(5) >= A067820(12).
%C A117969 a(4) is smaller than the number 488995430567765317569 found by Forbes. [From _T. D. Noe_, Oct 29 2008]

%e A117969 a(2) = 33 because 33, 34, 35 is the least run of three consecutive 2-almost primes (semiprimes).
