%N A117974 Triangle where a(1,1)=1; a(n,m) = number of positive integers which are missing from row (n-1) of the triangle, are <= m and are coprime to m.
%e A117974 Row 5 of the triangle is [0,0,1,1,3]. There are 0 positive integers which are coprime to 1, are <= 1 and are not among the terms of row 5 (because 1 occurs in row 5). There are 0 positive integers which are <= 2, are coprime to 2 and are not among the terms of row 5. ...(Skipping over the m = 3, 4 and 5 cases.) There is 1 positive integer (5) which is <= 6, is coprime to 6 and does not occur in row 5.
%e A117974 So row 6 is [0,0,1,0,2,1].
