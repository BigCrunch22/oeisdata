%N A117545 Least k such that Phi(k,n), the k-th cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at n, is prime.
%C A117545 Note that a(n)=1 iff n-1 is prime because Phi(1,x)=x-1. For n<2048, we have the bound a(n)<251. However, a(2048) is greater than 10000. Is a(n) defined for all n? For fixed n, there are many sequences listing the k that make Phi(k,n) prime: A000043, A028491, A004061, A004062, A004063, A004023, A005808, A016054, A006032, A006033, A006034, A006035.
