%N A117943 a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1; a(3n) = a(n); if every third term (a(3), a(6), a(9), ...) is deleted, this gives back the original sequence.
%C A117943 A self-generating sequence.
%C A117943 A super-fractal? Might also be called a lizard sequence (une suite du lézard) because it grows back from its tail.
%C A117943 Terms were computed by Gilles Sadowski.
%C A117943 First differences of Rauzy's sequence A071996. - _Benoit Cloitre_, Mar 10 2007
%C A117943 This is the characteristic sequence of A178931. Instead of "a(1)=0, a(2)=1", one could also say "Lexicographically earliest nontrivial sequence such that...". Starting with "a(1)=1, a(2)=2" would yield the m=3 analog of (the m=10 variant) A126616. See A255824-A255829 for the m=4,...,m=9 variants. - _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 07 2015
