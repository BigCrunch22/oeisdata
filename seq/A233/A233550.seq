%N A233550 Gap g between 3 consecutive primes for the smallest k such that 6^n+k, 6^n+k+g, 6^n+k+2*g are consecutive primes in arithmetic progression.
%C A233550 Sequence starts for n=2 as no solution for n=1.
%C A233550 g is a multiple of 6 as otherwise 6^n+k, 6^n+k+g, or 6^n+k+2*g is divisible by 2 or 3. - _Jonathan Sondow_, Dec 16 2013

%F A233550 a(n) = 6*A233742(n). - _Jonathan Sondow_, Dec 16 2013
%e A233550 6^2+11=47, 6^2+11+6=53, 6^2+11+2*6=59 are consecutive primes and k=11 is minimal, so a(2)=6. - _Jonathan Sondow_, Dec 16 2013
