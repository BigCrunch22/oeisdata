%N A233412 c-analog of Euler  phi-function: a(n) is number of nonnegative integers not exceeding n and c-prime to n.
%C A233412 Every number in binary is a concatenation of parts of the form 10...0 with k>=0 zeros. For example, 5=(10)(1), 11=(10)(1)(1), 7=(1)(1)(1). We call d>0 is a c-divisor of m, if d consists of some consecutive parts of m which are following in natural order (from the left to the right) in m (cf. comment in A124771). Note that, to d=0 corresponds an empty set of parts. So it is natural to consider 0 as a c-divisor of every m. For example, 3=(1)(1) is a c-divisor of 23, since (1)(1) includes in 23=(10)(1)(1)(1) in a natural order. Analogously, 1,2,5,7,11,23 are c-divisors of 23. But 6=(1)(10) is not a c-divisor of 23.
%C A233412 c-GCD(k,m) is called maximal common c-divisor of k,m. For example, c-GCD(7,11)=3.
%C A233412 Two numbers k,m are called mutually c-prime one to another, if c-GCD(k,m)=0.
%C A233412 In particular, 0 is c-prime to 0 (cf. 1 is prime to 1). Therefore, a(0)=1. Besides, every positive integer is c-prime to 0.

%F A233412 a(2^n)=2^n.
%e A233412 Let n=12=(1)(100). It is clear that odd numbers end in (1) and are not prime to 12.
%e A233412 Besides, 6=(1)(10) also contains part (1) and 4=(100) is c-divisor of 12. Other even <=10 {0,2,8,10} are prime to 12. Thus a(12)=4.
