%N A233473 Least k such that there are n triangular numbers between triangular(k) and k^2.
%e A233473 Least k such that there are 2 triangular numbers between triangular(k) and k^2 is k=7: triangular(8)=36 and triangular(9)=45 are between triangular(7)=28 and 7^2=49. Thus a(2)=7.
%e A233473 Least k such that there are 3 triangular numbers between triangular(k) and k^2 is k=9: 55, 66, 78 are the triangular numbers between triangular(9)=45 and 9^2=81. Thus a(3)=9.
