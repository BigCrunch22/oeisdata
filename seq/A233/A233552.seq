%N A233552 Odd integers k such that for every m >= 1 the numbers k*4^m - 1 have at least three prime factors, not necessarily distinct, and k*4^m - 1 has at least two-element covering set.
%C A233552 Here an n-element covering set is a minimal set of n distinct primes such that at least one of these primes divides every integer in the sequence k*4^m - 1, m >= 1. - _Arkadiusz Wesolowski_, Jul 21 2021
