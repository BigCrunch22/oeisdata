%N A233970 Toothpick sequence on hexagonal net starting from the vertex of a 60-degree wedge (see Comments lines for precise definition).
%C A233970 Toothpicks are connected by their endpoints. The toothpicks placed in north direction are prohibited. The sequence gives the number of toothpicks after n-th stage in the structure. A233971 (the first differences) give the number of toothpicks added at n-th stage.
%C A233970 First differs from A169780 at a(24).
%C A233970 First differs from both A233764 and A233780 at a(25).
