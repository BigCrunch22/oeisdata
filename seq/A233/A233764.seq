%N A233764 Number of toothpicks and D-toothpicks after n-th stage in a D-toothpick "wide" triangle (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A233764 The D-toothpicks placed in northwest or northeast direction both are prohibited. Note that due this rule there are substructures with broken symmetry, for instance a(44) = 507, not 509. For another version without broken symmetry see A233780.
%C A233764 A233765 (the first differences) gives the number of toothpicks or D-toothpicks added at n-th stage.
%C A233764 First differs from A169780 at a(24).
%C A233764 First differs from A233970 at a(25).
%C A233764 First differs from A233780 at a(44).
