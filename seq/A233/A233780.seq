%N A233780 Number of toothpicks and D-toothpicks after n-th stage in a D-toothpick "wide" triangle (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A233780 The D-toothpicks placed in northwest or northeast direction both are prohibited, except in the substructures in which the symmetry could be broken, so a(44) = 509, not 507. For another version with broken symmetry in some substructures see A233764. See also A231348, a simpler cellular automaton based in triangles which has essentially a similar structure.
%C A233780 A233781 (the first differences) gives the number of toothpicks or D-toothpicks added at n-th stage.
%C A233780 First differs from A169780 at a(24).
%C A233780 First differs from A233970 at a(25).
%C A233780 First differs from A233764 at a(44).
