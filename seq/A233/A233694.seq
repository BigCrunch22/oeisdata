%N A233694 Position of n in the sequence (or tree) S generated in order by these rules: 0 is in S; if x is in S then x + 1 is in S; if nonzero x is in S then 1/x is in S; if x is in S, then i*x is in S; where duplicates are deleted as they occur.
%C A233694 It can be proved using the division algorithm for Gaussian integers that S is the set of Gaussian rational numbers: (b + c*i)/d, where b,c,d are integers and d is not 0.
%C A233694 The differences of this sequence give the number of elements in each level of the tree. This means that d(n) = a(n) - a(n-1) is at least 1, and is bounded by 3*d(n-1), since there are three times as many elements in each level, before we exclude repetitions. - _Jack W Grahl_, Aug 10 2018
%e A233694 The first 16 numbers generated are as follows: 0, 1, 2, i, 3, 1/2, 2 i, 1 + i, -i, -1, 4, 1/3, 3 i, 3/2, i/2, 1 + 2 i. The positions of the nonnegative integers are 1, 2, 3, 5, 11.
