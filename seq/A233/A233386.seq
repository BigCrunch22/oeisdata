%N A233386 Number of ways to write n = i + j + k with 0 < i <= j <= k and i, j, k not all equal such that phi(i)*phi(j)*phi(k) is a cube.
%C A233386 Conjecture: For each k = 3, 4, ..., any integer n >= 3*k can be written as n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_k with n_1, n_2, ..., n_k positive and not all equal such that the product phi(n_1)*phi(n_2)*...*phi(n_k) is a k-th power.
%C A233386 We have verified this conjecture with k = 3 for n up to 10^5 and with k = 4, 5, 6 for n up to 30000.
%C A233386 See also A236998 for a similar conjecture with k = 2.
