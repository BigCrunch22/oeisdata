%N A233762 Number of toothpicks and D-toothpicks after n-th stage in the D-toothpick "narrow" triangle of the third kind, second version.
%C A233762 The structure is essentially the same as A220522 but here the borders do not contain D-toothpicks with exposed endpoints except the initial D-toothpick. The structure is one of the oblique wedges of several D-toothpick structures. For more information see A220500. The first differences (A233763) give the number of toothpicks or D-toothpicks added at n-th stage.
