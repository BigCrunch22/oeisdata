%N A233549 Number of ways to write n = p + q (q > 0) with p and (phi(p)*phi(q))^4 + 1 prime, where phi(.) is Euler's totient function (A000010).
%C A233549 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 2.
%C A233549 (ii) If n > 2 is not equal to 26, then there is a prime p < n with (phi(p)*phi(n-p))^2 + 1 prime.
%C A233549 (iii) If n > 3 is different from 9 and 16, then there is a prime p < n with ((p+1)*phi(n-p))^2 + 1 prime.
%C A233549 Part (i) of the conjecture implies that there are infinitely many primes of the form x^4 + 1. We have verified it for n up to 10^7.

%e A233549 a(11) = 1 since 11 = 2 + 9 with 2 and (phi(2)*phi(9))^4 + 1 = 6^4 + 1 = 1297 both prime.
%e A233549 a(13) = 1 since 13 = 5 + 8 with 5 and (phi(5)*phi(8))^4 + 1 = 16^4 + 1 = 65537 both prime.
%e A233549 a(258) = 1 since 258 = 167 + 91 with 167 and (phi(167)*phi(91))^4 + 1 = (166*72)^4 + 1 = 20406209352892417 both prime.
