%N A233593 Positive integers k such that the continued fraction expansion sqrt(k) = c(1) + c(1)/(c(2) + c(2)/(c(3) + c(3)/....)) is aperiodic.
%C A233593 For more details about this type of expansions, see A233582.
%C A233593 The cases with known periodic expansions, listed in A233592, all become periodic after just two leading terms. In contrast, the Blazys's expansion of sqrt(a(k)) for every member a(k) of this list remains aperiodic up to at least 1000 terms. It is therefore conjectured, though not proved, that these expansions are indeed aperiodic.

%e A233593 Blazys's expansion of sqrt(7), A233587, is {2, 3, 30, 34, 111, ...}. Its first 1000 terms are all distinct. Hence, 7 is a term of this sequence.
