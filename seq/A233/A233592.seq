%N A233592 Positive integers k such that the continued fraction expansion sqrt(k) = c(1) + c(1)/(c(2) + c(2)/(c(3) + c(3)/...)) is periodic.
%C A233592 For more details on this type of expansion, see A233582.
%C A233592 The cases with aperiodic expansions are listed in A233593.
%C A233592 All the listed cases become periodic after just two leading terms (it is a conjecture that this behavior is general); the validity of their expansions was explicitly tested.

%e A233592 Blazys's expansion of sqrt(2) is {1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, ...}, i.e., it has a periodic termination. Consequently, 2 is a term of this sequence.
