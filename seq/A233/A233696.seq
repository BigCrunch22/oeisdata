%N A233696 Positions of integers in the sequence (or tree) S generated in order by these rules: 0 is in S; if x is in S then x + 1 is in S; if nonzero x is in S then 1/x is in S; if x is in S, then i*x is in S; where duplicates are deleted as they occur.
%C A233696 It can be proved using the division algorithm for Gaussian integers that S is the set of Gaussian rational numbers: (b + c*i)/d, where b,c,d are integers and d is not 0.
%e A233696 The first 16 numbers generated are as follows:  0, 1, 2, i, 3, 1/2, 2 i, 1 + i, -i, -1, 4, 1/3, 3 i, 3/2, i/2, 1 + 2 i.  Positions of integers 0, 1, 2, 3, -1, 4,... are 1,2,3,5,10,11,....
