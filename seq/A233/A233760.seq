%N A233760 Number of toothpicks and D-toothpicks after n-th stage in the D-toothpick "wide" triangle of the third kind, second version.
%C A233760 The structure is essentially the same as A220520 but here the borders do not contain toothpicks with exposed endpoints except the initial toothpick. The structure is one of the oblique wedges of several D-toothpick structures. For more information see A220500. The first differences (A233761) give the number of toothpicks or D-toothpicks added at n-th stage.
