%N A233293 Smallest number that is the largest value in the Collatz (3x + 1) trajectories of exactly n initial values. (a(n)=0 if no such number exists.)
%C A233293 Smallest number that appears exactly n times in A025586.
%C A233293 Numbers that are not the largest value in the 3x + 1 trajectory of any initial value (that is, numbers that do not appear at all in A025586) are in A213199; the smallest such number is a(0) = 3.
%C A233293 Numbers that are the largest value in the 3x + 1 trajectory of exactly one initial value (that is, numbers that appear exactly once in A025586) are in A222562; the smallest such number is a(1) = 1.
%C A233293 Numbers that are the largest value in the 3x + 1 trajectories of exactly three initial values (that is, numbers that appear exactly three times in A025586) are in A232870; the smallest such number is a(3) = 40.
%C A233293 No number that is the largest value in the 3x + 1 trajectories of exactly 2, 4, 5, 7, or 10 initial values exists, so a(n) = 0 at n = 2, 4, 5, 7, and 10; for all other values of n up to 3000, a(n) > 0. Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 10. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Dec 14 2013

%e A233293 a(0) = 3 because no 3x + 1 trajectories have 3 as their largest value, and 3 is the smallest number for which this is the case.
%e A233293 a(1) = 1 because exactly one 3x + 1 trajectory (namely, the one whose initial value is 1) has 1 as its largest value (and 1 is the smallest number for which this is the case).
%e A233293 a(3) = 40 because exactly three 3x + 1 trajectories (the ones whose initial values are 13, 26, and 40) have 40 as their largest value, and 40 is the smallest number for which this is the case.
%e A233293 a(2) = 0 because there exists no number that is the largest value in exactly two 3x + 1 trajectories.
