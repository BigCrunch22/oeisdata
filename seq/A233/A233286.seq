%N A233286 Number of trailing zeros in the factorial base representation of n-th Fibonacci number; a(n) =  A230403(A000045(n)) = A233285(n)-1.
%C A233286 A233285 is the main entry for this topic, see comments there.
%F A233286 a(n) = A230403(A000045(n)) = A233285(n)-1.
%e A233286 The factorial base representation (A007623(A000045(n)) of Fibonacci numbers look like this, from n=1 onward: 1, 1, 10, 11, 21, 110, 201, 311, 1120, 2101, 3221, 11000, 14221, 30221, 50120, 121011, 211201, 332220, ...
%e A233286 When we count the trailing zeros of each, we get 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, ..., the first terms of this sequence.
