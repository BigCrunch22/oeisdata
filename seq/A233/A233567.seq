%N A233567 Number of ways to write n = p + q (q > 0) with p and p^4 + phi(q)^4 both prime, where phi(.) is Euler's totient function (A000010).
%C A233567 Conjecture: If n > 2 is not equal to 5, then we have a(n) > 0, also there is a prime p < n with p^2 + phi(n-p)^2 prime.
%C A233567 We have verified this for n up to 10^7. The first assertion in the conjecture implies that there are infinitely many primes of the form p^4 + q^4, where p is a prime and q is a positive integer.

%e A233567 a(7) = 1 since 7 = 3 + 4 with 3 and 3^4 + phi(4)^4 = 81 + 16 = 97 both prime.
%e A233567 a(12) = 1 since 12 = 7 + 5 with 7 and 7^4 + phi(5)^4 = 7^4 + 4^4 = 2657 both prime.
%e A233567 a(31) = 1 since 31 = 23 + 8 with 23 and 23^4 + phi(8)^4 = 23^4 + 4^4 = 280097 both prime.
%e A233567 a(36) = 1 since 36 = 3 + 33 with 3 and 3^4 + phi(33)^4 = 3^4 + 20^4 = 160081 both prime.
