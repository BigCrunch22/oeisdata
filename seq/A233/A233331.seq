%N A233331 Irregular array read by rows: T(n,k) = number of r_{n,k}-cores associated with A233332(n,k), reduced for symmetry, for n>=2, 1<=k<=floor(n/2), explained below.
%C A233331 For definitions and more details, see the PDF by L. E. Jeffery.
%C A233331 Let n be an integer, n >= 2, and let k in {1,...,floor(n/2)}. Let R_n be the set of floor(n/2) rhombi in which the k-th rhombus r_{n,k} in R_n has interior angles about its vertices (or corners) given by the pair (k*Pi/n, (n-k)*Pi/n). Let T be any tiling of the plane. For any tile t in T, let C_m(t) denote the m-th corona of t, m>=0. Equivalently, starting with any r in R_n fixed in the plane, we can compose a corona C_m(r) of r of any order m by tessellation using tiles of R_n. For any r in R_n fixed in the plane, a disjoint union of r with four tiles t_1,t_2,t_3,t_4 in R_n is called a "candidate." If no tiles overlap in a candidate, then that candidate is called an "r-core;" otherwise that candidate is rejected (since no corona of r can be constructed from it). For each r_{n,k} in R_n, and for m>0, every r_{n,k}-core can be extended to an m-th corona of r_{n,k} using tiles of R_n in a number of ways. For the case m=1, the array A233332 gives the number of ways that this can be done for each n and k. In the theory of tiles the general problem of counting these coronas and its reduction for symmetry seem to have not been addressed before in the literature.
%C A233331 The array A233330 gives the number of r_{n,k}-cores associated with the coronas enumerated in A233332. The present array A233331 gives the number of r_{n,k}-cores associated with the coronas enumerated in A233332 when isometries different from the identity are not counted.
