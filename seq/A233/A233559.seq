%N A233559 Tree read by levels generated by these rules: 1 is at the top, and the node x has child nodes x+1, 2*x, and 3*x, where duplicates are deleted as they occur.
%C A233559 Every positive integer occurs exactly once in S, so that S is a permutation of the natural numbers. Deleting duplicates as they occur, the generations of S are given by g(1) = (1), g(2) = (2,3), g(3) = (4,6,9), g(4) = (5,8,12,7,18,10,27), ... Concatenating gives 1,2,3,4,6,9,5,...

%e A233559 To generate S, start with g(1) = (1). Then 1 begets 2 and 3; then 2 begets 4 and 3 begets 6 and 9.
