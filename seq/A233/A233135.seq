%N A233135 Shortest (x+1,2x)-code of n.
%C A233135 Every positive integer is a composite of f(x) = x + 1 and g(x) = 2*x starting with x = 1.  For example, 5 = f(g(g(1))), which abbreviates as fgg, or 122, which we call a (x+1,2x)-code of 5.  It appears that the number of (x+1,2x)-codes of n is A040039(n), that these numbers form Guy Steele's sequence GS(4,5) at A135529, and that for k >= 1, then number of such codes is F(n-1), where F = A000045, the Fibonacci numbers.  See A232559 for the uncoded positive integers in the order generated by the rules x -> x+1 and x -> 2*x.

%F A233135 Define h(x) = x - 1 if x is odd and h(x) = x/2 if x is even, and define H(x,1) = h(x) and H(x,k) = H(H(x,k-1)).  For each n > 1, the sequence (H(n,k)) decreases to 1 through two kinds of steps; write 1 when the step is x - 1 and write 2 when the step is x/2.  Let c(n) be the concatenation of 1s and 2s; then A233135(n) is the reversal of c(n), as in the Mathematica program.
