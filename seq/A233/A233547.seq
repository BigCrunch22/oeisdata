%N A233547 a(n) = |{0 < k < n/2: phi(k)*phi(n-k) - 1 and phi(k)*phi(n-k) + 1 are both prime}|, where phi(.) is Euler's totient function.
%C A233547 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 5.
%C A233547 (ii) For any n > 3, sigma(k)*phi(n-k) - 1 and sigma(k)*phi(n-k) + 1 are both prime for some 0 < k < n, where sigma(k) is the sum of all (positive) divisors of k.
%C A233547 (iii) For any n > 5 not equal to 35, there is a positive integer k < n such that phi(k)*phi(n-k) - 1 is a Sophie Germain prime.
%C A233547 Note that part (i) implies the twin prime conjecture. We have verified it for n up to 10^7.
