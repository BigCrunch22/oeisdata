%N A233542 Number of ways to write n = k^2 + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that phi(k^2)*phi(m) - 1 is prime, where phi(.) is Euler's totient function (A000010).
%C A233542 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 5.
%C A233542 (ii) Any integer n > 7 can be written as k^2 + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that phi(k)^2*phi(m) - 1 is prime.
%C A233542 (iii) If n > 1 is not equal to 36, then n can be written as k^2 + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that sigma(k)^2*phi(m) + 1 is prime, where sigma(k) is the sum of all (positive) divisors of k.
%C A233542 We have verified part (i) of the conjecture for n up to 2*10^7.
