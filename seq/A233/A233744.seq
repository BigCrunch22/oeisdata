%N A233744 Numbers p = a(n) such that p divided by (n-1)! is equal to the average number of elements of partition sets of n elements excluding sets with a singleton.
%C A233744 a(n)/(n-1)! is the average number of loops when n players are randomly taking the name of another player (excluding their own name). This is just referring to a game called the "Guardian angel" proposed by a former colleague at work.
%C A233744 For n>2, a(n) appears to be divisible by 2n-4 and, for n>5, additionally by either 10 or 30. - _Ralf Stephan_, Dec 17 2013

%F A233744 a(n) = (n-1)! * S(n), with S(n) = 1 + 1/(n-1) * sum of previous S(i) with i in (2, n-2).
%e A233744 For example, if, among 5 players A,B,C,D,E, A takes C and C takes B and B takes A, one loop would be ACB and the other loop would be DE. No single element loop is allowed.
%e A233744 For n = 2, the only possible loop is a 2 elements loop AB ==> a(2) = 1.
%e A233744 for n = 3, the only possible loop is a 3 elements loop ABC or ACB ==> a(3) = 2 as a(3) / 2! = 1.
%e A233744 for n = 4, there are two types of loop, the ABCD loop and AB + CD loops, there is 2 chances out of 3 to get the ABCD type loop and 1 chance out of 3 to get the "AB + CD" configuration. The average number of loop is therefore 2/3 X 1 + 1/3 X 2 = 4/3 = 8 / 6 =  a(4)/3!.
%e A233744 for n = 5, there are two types of loop, the ABCDE loop and ABC + DE loops, there is 2 chances out of 4 to get the ABCDE type loop and 2 chance out of 4 to get the "ABC + DE" configuration. The average number of loop is therefore 2/4 X 1 + 2/4 X 2 = 6/4 = 36 / 24 =  a(5)/4!.
