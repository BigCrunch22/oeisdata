%N A192743 The numbers n in s=n^2 + (n+1)^2 that satisfy the requirement for two consecutive squares c,d with c<d with d-c being the sum of two consecutive squares that c<s<d will give s-c and d-s both being squares.
%e A192743 For n=41, s = 2*41^2 + 2*41 +1 = 3445, the sum of two consecutive squares.  With s falling in the interval of two other consecutive squares 58^2<s<59^2 or 3364<3445<3481, one gets squares 36 for 3481-3445 and 81 for 3345-3364.
