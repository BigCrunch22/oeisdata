%N A192020 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of unordered pairs of nodes at distance k in the binomial tree of order n (1 <= k <= 2n-1; entries in row n are the coefficients of the corresponding Wiener polynomial).
%C A192020 The binomial trees b(k) of order k are ordered trees defined as follows:
%C A192020 1. b(0) consists of a single node.
%C A192020 2. For k >= 1, b(k) is obtained from two copies of b(k-1) by linking them in such a way that the root of one is the leftmost child of the root of the other. See the Iyer & Reddy references.
%C A192020 Row n contains 2n-1 entries.
%C A192020 _Kevin Ryde_, Sep 14 2019: (Start)
%C A192020 In the formulas below, the generating function for number of vertices at depth is r(n,t) = (t+1)^n = Sum_{i=0..n} binomial(n,i)*t^i.  The w(n,t) recurrence applied repeatedly is a sum of those, and from which the rational function for w(n,t).
%C A192020 T(n,k) as sum over j follows from which binomials are put at which indices in the g.f.  Or the direct interpretation is to number vertices v=0 to 2^n-1 inclusive with parent(v) = A129760(v) in the usual way, then suppose a pair of vertices u,v have their highest differing bit at position j, where j=1 as the least significant bit.  One of u or v has a 1-bit at j.  To be distance k apart requires k-1 further 1-bits among the bits below j in u and v, hence binomial(2(j-1),k-1).  The bits above j are the same in u and v and can be any 2^(n-j) (those bits and 0's below are the common ancestor of u,v).

%e A192020 T(2,1)=3, T(2,2)=2, T(2,3)=1 because the binomial tree b(2) is basically the path tree A-B-R-C and we have 3 (AB, BR, RC), 2 (AR, BC), and 1 (AC) pairs of nodes at distances 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
