%N A192720 High-water marks of A062357: record values of prime(n)-n*(prime(n+1)-prime(n)).
%C A192720 The numbers in the sequence are generated in correspondence of twin primes.  I.e. a(n)=-A(062357(k)) where k is such as p(k) is the lowest of a pair of twin primes.  The sequence seems to have a good linear approximation with something like 11^2*n^2-10*11^4.
