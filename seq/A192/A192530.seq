%N A192530 Index-list (modified) of the primes generated at A192583.
%C A192530 Besides the generated primes 2,5,11,13,17,..., the initial numbers 4,6,8 in A192583 are represented here by index of nearest lower prime.
%e A192530 A192583=(2,4,5,6,8,11,13,17,23,...).  a(1)=1 because the index of 2 is 1; a(2)=2 because, for term #2 of A192530, which is 4, the nearest prime <4 is 3, which has index 2; a(3)=3 because the index of 5 is 3.  ("Nearest prime down" for nonprimes is given by PrimePi in the Mathematica program.)
