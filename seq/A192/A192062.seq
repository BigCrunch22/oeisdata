%N A192062 Square Array T(ij) read by antidiagonals (from NE to SW) with columns 2j being the denominators of continued fraction convergents to square root of (j^2 + 2j).
%C A192062 Column j=1 is the Fibonacci sequence A000045.  Column 2 is A002530; column 4 is A041011; column 6 is A041023; column 8 is A041039, column 10 is A041059, column 12 is A041083, column 14 is A041111 corresponding the denominators of continued fraction convergents to square root of 3,8,15,24,35,48 and 63.
%C A192062   T(2*i-1,j)*T(2*i,j)^2*T(2*i+1,j)*j/2 appears to be always a triangular number, T(j*T(2*i,j)^2).
%C A192062   T(2*i,j)*T(2*i+1,j)^2*T(2*i+2)*j/2 appears to always equal a triangular number, T(j*T(2*i,j)*T(2*i+2,j)).
%C A192062 Conjecture re relation of A192062 to the sequence of primes: T(2*n,j) = A(n,j)*T(n,j) where A(n,j) is from the square array A191971. There, A(3*n,j) = A(n,j)*B(n,j) where B(n,j) are integers. It appears further that B(5*n,j)=B(n,j)*C(n,j); C(7*n,j)= C(n,j)*D(n,j); D(11*n,j) = D(n,j)*E(n,j); E(13*n,j) = E(n,j)*F(n,j) and F(17*n,j) = F(n,j)*G(n,j) where C(n,j), D(n,j) etc. are all integers. My conjecture is that this property continues indefinitely and follows the sequence of primes.

%F A192062 Each column j is a recursive sequence defined by T(0,j)=0, T(1,j) = 1, T(2i,j)= T(2i-2,j)+T(2i-1,j) and T(2i+1,j) = T(2i-1,j)+j*T(2i,j). Also, T(n+2,j) = (j+2)*T(n,j)-T(n-2,j).
%F A192062 T(2n,j) = Sum(k=1 to n) C(k)*T(2*k,j-1) where the C(k) are the n-th row of the triangle A191579.
%F A192062 T(2*i,j) = T(i,j)*A(i,j) where A(i,j) is from the table A(i,j) of A191971.
%F A192062 T(4*i,j) = (T(2*i+1)^2 - T(2*i-1)^2)/j
%F A192062 T(4*i+2,j) = T(2*i+2,j)^2 - T(2*i,j)^2
