%N A192180 Composite numbers n such that all digits of n occur in its list of primes.
%C A192180 For the purpose here, if a number has repeated prime factors, those are written repeatedly. For example, the factorization of 27 is expressed as (3, 3, 3) rather than (3^3). - _Alonso del Arte_, Jul 05 2011

%e A192180 Since the prime factorization of 95 is (5, 19), and both 9 and 5 occur in (5, 19), the number 95 is on the list.
%e A192180 Since the prime factorization of 1255 is (5, 251), and 1, 2, and both 5s occur in (5, 251), the number 1255 is on the list.
%e A192180 22 is not on the list because its prime factorization is (2, 11) and that does not have enough 2s. Nor is 25 on the list because for this sequence we express its factorization as (5, 5) rather than (5^2).
