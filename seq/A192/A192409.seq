%N A192409 Number of letters in the English name of the n-th element in the periodic table of the elements.
%C A192409 The names are based on the IUPAC Inorganic Chemistry Division table.
%C A192409 The sequence appears to be not very well defined, concerning the terms (names can change) and number of terms (in June/November 2016 four new names were given to elements number 113, 115, 117 and 118). - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 24 2020
%C A192409 The names my change, certainly, but at any given time the sequence is defined by the names in the IUPAC Inorganic Chemistry Division table. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 25 2020

%e A192409 a(1) = 8, because HYDROGEN uses 8 letters.
%e A192409 a(2) = 6, because HELIUM uses 6 letters.
%e A192409 a(3) = 7, because LITHIUM uses 7 letters.
%e A192409 and so on. Note that a(13) = 9, not 8, since the IUPAC spellings are used.
