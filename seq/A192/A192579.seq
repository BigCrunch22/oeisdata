%N A192579 Primes p for which there is no prime q == 3 (mod 4) that is smaller than p and is a quadratic residue modulo p.
%C A192579 Gica proved that if p is a prime different from 2, 3, 5, 7, 17, then there exists a prime q < p which is a quadratic residue modulo p and q == 3 (mod 4).
%C A192579 This is the unique set of primes answering the question in the Mathematics Stack Exchange link. - _Rick L. Shepherd_, May 29 2016

%e A192579 p = 17 is a member, because the primes q < p with q == 3 (mod 4) are q = 3, 7, 11, and they are not quadratic residues modulo 17.
%e A192579 11 is not a member, because 3 < 11 and 3 == 5^2 (mod 11).
