%N A192018 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of unordered pairs of nodes at distance k in the binary Fibonacci tree of order n (1<=k<=2n-3; entries in row n are the coefficients of the corresponding Wiener polynomial).
%C A192018 The binary Fibonacci trees f(k) of order k is a rooted binary tree defined as follows: 1. f(0) has no nodes and f(1) consists of a single node. 2. For k>=2, f(k) is constructed from a root with f(k-1) as its left subtree and f(k-2) as its right subtree. See the Iyer & Reddy references.
%C A192018 Row n contains 2n-3 entries.
%C A192018 T(n,1) = A001911(n-1) (Fibonacci numbers minus 2).
%C A192018 Sum_{k>=1} k*T(n,k) = A192019(n) (the Wiener indices).

%F A192018 The Wiener polynomial w(n,t) of the binary Fibonacci tree of order n satisfies the recurrence relation w(n,t) = w(n-1,t) + w(n-2,t) + t*r(n-1,t) + t*r(n-2) + t^2*r(n-1,t)*r(n-2,t), w(1,t)=0, w(2,t)=t, where r(n,t) is the generating polynomial of the nodes of the binary Fibonacci tree f(n) with respect to the level of the nodes (for example, r(2,t) = 1 + t for the tree / ; see A004070 and the Maple program).
