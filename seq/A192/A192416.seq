%N A192416 The sequence obtained from A005117 (the squarefree numbers) by the transformation "forming" as defined in A191612.
%C A192416 See A191612 for the definition of the transformation which maps A005117 to this sequence here.
%C A192416 Conjecture: a(n) is also a "totally formed" sequence.
%e A192416 a(10) = 14 because 14 is the only integer larger than 13 = A005117(9) and smaller than or equal to A005117(10) = 14 and simultaneously a multiple of the difference A005117(10) - A005117(9) = 1.
