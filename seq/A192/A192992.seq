%N A192992 Odd n > 1 such that n+1 is a semiprime times a power of two.
%C A192992 Odd n (A005408(i>0; 2*j+1 for j>0) such that n+1 is a semiprime times a power of two. Odd n such that n+1 is a A001358(i) times a power of two. Odd n such that n+1 is in A192991. This is to thin numbers A192868 as semiprimes A001358 are to primes A000040.
%F A192992 a(n) = A192991(n) - 1.
%e A192992 239 is in the sequence because 239+1 = 240 = 6th semiprime * 2^4 = 3 * 5 * 16.
%Y A192992 Cf. A005408, A001358, A192868, A192990, A192991.
