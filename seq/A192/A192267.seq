%N A192267 Anti-deficient numbers.
%C A192267 An anti-deficient number is a number n for which sigma*(n) < n, where sigma*(n) is the sum of the anti-divisors of n. Like A005100 but using anti-divisors. There are only 22 anti-deficient numbers less than 100, 159 less than 1000 and 1547 less than 10000. From an empirical observation it seems that the anti-deficient are approximately less than 18% of the anti-abundant.

%F A192267 A000027 = A073930 UNION {this set} UNION A192268.
%e A192267 24 is anti-deficient because its anti-divisors are 7, 16 and their sum is 23 < 24.
