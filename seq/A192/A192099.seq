%N A192099 Least number of parts in a partition of n into signed terms of the form 2^k-1.
%C A192099 Another interpretation: Let T be the infinite binary tree with all leaves at the same level. Then a(n) is the least number of edges in any cut (X,Y) where |X| = n.

%F A192099 Let d(n) = floor(log(n)/log(2)). Then a(n) = 1 + min{ a(n-(2^d(n)-1)), a((2^(d(n)+1)-1)-n) } with a(0)=0 and a(1)=1.
%e A192099 a(43) = 3 since 43 = 31+15-3 and there is no way to write 43 using fewer terms of the form 2^k-1.
%e A192099 The smallest value of n for which a(n) = 5 is 83 = 31+15+7-3+1.
