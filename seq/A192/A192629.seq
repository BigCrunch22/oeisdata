%N A192629 Numerators of the Fermat-Euler rational Diophantine m-tuple.
%C A192629 Fermat gave the integer Diophantine m-tuple 1, 3, 8, 120 (see A030063): 1 + the product of any two distinct terms is a square. Euler added the rational number 777480/8288641.
%C A192629 It was unknown whether this rational Diophantine m-tuple can be extended by another rational number. Herrmann, Pethoe, and Zimmer proved that the sequence is finite, but no bound on its length is known.
%C A192629 In 2019, Stoll proved that an extension of Fermat's set to a rational quintuple with the same property is unique. Thus, the quintuple 1, 3, 8, 120, 777480/8288641 cannot be extended to a rational Diophantine sextuple. - _Andrej Dujella_, May 12 2024
