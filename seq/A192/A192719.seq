%N A192719 Chain of Collatz sequences.
%C A192719 The sequence is a chain of Collatz sequences. The first Collatz sequence in the chain is (1). Each of the subsequent Collatz sequences in the chain starts with the minimum positive integer that does not appear in the previous Collatz sequences. If the Collatz conjecture is true, then each Collatz sequence in the chain will end with 1, and the chain will include an infinite number of distinct Collatz sequences. If the Collatz conjecture is false, then the chain will end with the first Collatz sequence that does not converge to 1.

%e A192719 The first Collatz sequence in the chain is (1). The second Collatz sequence in the chain is (2, 1), which starts with 2, since 2 is the smallest positive integer that doesn't appear the first Collatz sequence. The third Collatz sequence in the chain is (3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1), which starts with 3, since 3 is the smallest positive integer that doesn't appear the previous Collatz sequences.
