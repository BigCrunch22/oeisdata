%N A192189 Polynomial-like numbers: numbers whose sequence of number-derivatives (A003415) is monotonically decreasing.
%C A192189 Every prime is in the sequence. If n==0 (mod 4), then it is not in the sequence. Moreover, if, for a prime p, n==0 (mod p^p), then n is not in the sequence. Indeed, if n=(p^p)*k, then n'=(p^p)'*k+p^p*k'=p^p(k+k')>=n, analogously, n''>=n', etc.
%C A192189 Conjecture. For every sufficiently large greater q of twin primes, the sequence contains infinite increasing sequence {s_n} of semiprimes beginning with 2*(q-2), such that (s_n)'=s_(n-1).
%C A192189 This conjecture is true, if 1) there exist infinitely many twin primes; 2) there exists n_0, such that for every prime p>n_0, number 2*p is sum of two primes r,t, for which r*t-2 is prime.
%C A192189 Proof. Let q>=n_0. Put s_1=2(q-2). By the condition, 2(q-2)=r+t, such that r*t-2 is prime. Put s_2=r*t and s_3=2(r*t-2). Then (s_3)'=2'*(r*t-2)+2*(r*t-2)'=s_2; (s_2)'=r+t=s_1. Continuing this process, we get an infinite sequence of semiprimes and every semiprime is a number whose sequence of number-derivatives is monotonically decreasing.

%e A192189 Let n=50. We have A003415(50) = 45, A003415(45) = 39, A003415(39) = 16 but a(16) = 32. Thus 50 is not in the sequence.
%e A192189 49 is in the sequence: A003415^(i)(49)|_{i=0..6} = 49, 14, 9, 6, 5, 1, 0.
