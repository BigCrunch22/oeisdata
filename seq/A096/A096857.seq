%N A096857 a[n] is the length of terminal cycle of the trajectory of g[x]=sigma(phi(x)) if started at 2^n. Formally identical to A096852, but arguments are shifted by 1 and the iterated functions are different!.
%C A096857 Offset=1 in contrast to A096852, where offset=0. Also the iterated functions deviate: A062401 iterated in A096852 and A062402 is repeated here; A096852(n)=A096857(n+1) appears to be true. While cycle-lengths seem identical, the composition of cycles are mostly different!
%e A096857 n=5:iv=32 list={32,[31,72,60]} length=a(5)=3, while the parallel case of A096852(n)=b(n) is b[4] with [16,24,30] cycle.
%e A096857 Also A096857[11] starts with 2048 ends in 6-cycle: {2048,2047,4123,10890,8928,[9906,9920,12264,10200,6138,6045],9906,..
%e A096857 while A096852[11-1]=6 and the relevant 6-cycle is {1024,1936,3240,2640,[2880,3024,3840,3456,2560,1800],2880,... These are different cycles with identical lengths.
%e A096857 The initial value 146 leads to list with enormous terms.
