%N A096469 Smallest number m such that the concatenation of n+1 numbers m^0, m^1,..., m^(n-1), m^n is a prime.
%C A096469 Conjecture: This sequence is infinite. a(n) = 1 if and only if n + 1 is in the sequence A004023, so a(1) = a(18) = a(22) = a(316) = a(1030) = a(49080) = a(86452) = 1 and there are no other n less than 86453 such that a(n) = 1. Every term of this sequence is odd and for each n, 5 doesn't divide a(n). a(50) is greater than 11111.
%e A096469 a(2) = 3 because 3^0 = 1, 3^1 = 3, and 3^2 = 9; 139 is prime and 3 is the smallest number that gives this result.
%e A096469 a(3) = 33 because 33^0 = 1; 33^1 = 33; 33^2 = 1089; 33^3 = 35937; 133108935937 is a prime and 33 is the smallest number that gives this result.
