%N A096832 Number of primes in enlarged neighborhood with center = n-th primorial and radius = 2*ceiling(log(n-th primorial)). So compared to A096831, the radius is doubled.
%C A096832 What is exceptional in such neighborhoods of primorials is that in most cases no primes occur, i.e., these zones are peculiarly poor or empty of primes! If the radius is doubled then the density of primes appears to be "normal".
%e A096832 n=7: 7th primorial = 510510; for radius=14, no primes in the relevant neighborhood; for radius=28, then one prime appears: 510529.
