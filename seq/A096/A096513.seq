%N A096513 Numbers k such that A096509(k) = 2; i.e., the number of prime powers (including primes) in the neighborhood of k with radius ceiling(log(k)) is 2.
%e A096513 k=36 is a term: ceiling(log(36)) = ceiling(3.5835...) = 4, and in [36-4, 36+4] = [32, 40], 32 and 37 are the two corresponding powers of primes.
