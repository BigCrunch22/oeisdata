%N A096063 Beginning with the sequence S(1)={1} form, in succession, the sequence S(n) for n=2,3,4,... by inserting the n smallest multiples of n that have not been used previously, in order of increasing size, n-1 of them between the final n terms of S(n-1) and the final multiple after the last term of S(n-1). {a(n)} is the limit of this process as n -> inf.
%C A096063 After n steps of the construction process n(n-1)/2 terms have been decided.

%e A096063 The next step is to place unused multiples of 6, i.e. 18,24,36,42,48,54 at position marked ##:
%e A096063 2,3,1,8,6,12,5,4,10,16,##,15,##,9,##,25,##,20,##,30,##
%e A096063 ...
%e A096063 After the 5th stage the terms 2,3,1,8,6,12,5,4,10,16 remain unchanged, hence form the initial 10 terms of the desired sequence.
