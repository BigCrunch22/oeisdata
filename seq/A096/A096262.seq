%N A096262 An exceptional set of 26 prime powers related to elliptic curves over finite fields.
%C A096262 Let F be the finite field with q elements and E an elliptic curve defined over F; so the Abelian group E(F) has structure (Z/n1) X (Z/n2) where n2|n1 and n2|(q-1) and its order n=n1*n2 satisfies the Hasse inequalities |sqrt(n)-sqrt(q)| <= 1.
%C A096262 Unless q is in the set of 26 exceptions shown here, the value of n1 completely determines n2 and hence both the group order and its structure. So to find the group order (and structure) it is sufficient to find an element of maximal order, n1.
