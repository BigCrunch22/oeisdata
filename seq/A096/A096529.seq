%N A096529 Numbers whose divisors can be permuted so that all sums of triple adjacent divisors are primes.
%C A096529 Square of terms of A053182 are in this sequence. - _Michel Marcus_, May 08 2014
%C A096529 From _Amiram Eldar_, Nov 08 2024: (Start)
%C A096529 The possible values of the number of even divisors of even terms of this sequence is restricted by the number of odd divisors.
%C A096529 Let k be a term and d_odd(k) = A001227(k) and d_even(k) = A183063 be its number of odd divisors and number of even divisors, respectively. When k is even, in a valid permutation of its divisors there must be two even divisors between two odd divisors, at most 2 before the first odd divisor, and at most 2 after the last odd divisor.
%C A096529 Therefore, d_even(k) - 2*(d_odd(k) - 1) <= 4. Let d(k) = A000005(k) = d_odd(k) + d_even(k), and let e = A007814(k) and m = A000265(k). Then, k = 2^e * m, d(k) = (e+1) * d(m) = (e+1) * d_odd(k), so d_even(k) = e * d_odd(k), and |e-2| * d_odd(k) <= 2.
%C A096529 If m = 1, then d_odd(k) = 1 and e <= 4, so 16 = 2^4 is the largest power of 2 in this sequence.
%C A096529 If m = p is a prime, then d_odd(k) = 2 and e <= 3, and therefore only terms of the form 2*p, 4*p or 8*p are possible. 2*p is a term if and only if p is a term of A106067.
%C A096529 If m is composite, then d_odd(k) > 2 and e <= 2, and therefore k is not divisible by 8. (End)
