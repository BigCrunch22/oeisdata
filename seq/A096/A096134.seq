%N A096134 a(1) = 2; for n > 1: a(n) = least multiple m of n such that m is coprime to n+1 and the absolute difference of a(n) and a(n-1) is a prime distinct from all earlier such differences of consecutive terms.
%C A096134 Condition gcd(a(n),n+1) = 1 ensures that a(n+1) exists.
%C A096134 Primes arising as absolute first differences are given in A096878.
%C A096134 For corresponding sequence starting (more naturally) at 1 see A096879.
%e A096134 a(8) has to be a multiple of 8; 80 is the smallest one that satisfies all conditions: 80 is coprime to 9, abs(a(7) - 80) = 73 is prime and distinct from all earlier absolute differences 2, 5, 3, 7, 13, 11. Hence a(8) = 80.
%e A096134 a(9) has to be a multiple of 9; 9 is the smallest one that satisfies all conditions: 9 is coprime to 10, abs(a(8) - 9) = 71 is prime and distinct from all earlier absolute differences 2, 5, 3, 7, 13, 11, 73. Hence a(9) = 9.
