%N A096316 Given the number wheel 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 then starting with 2, the next number is a prime p number of positions from the previous number found, for p=2,3,...
%C A096316 Conjecture: This sequence carried to infinity is non-repeating and non-terminating. If we concatenate the numbers and introduce a decimal point somewhere, we will get an irrational number.
%F A096316 n=2, n = (n mod 10 + p)%10 where p is prime = 2, 3, 5...
%e A096316 Imagine a number wheel 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 like the numbers on an odometer. The first prime in the wheel is 2. Counting from 2, the next number is 2 positions beyond 2 which is 4; counting 3 positions from 4, we get 7; counting 5 positions from 7 (when we hit 9, we go to 0) we get 2. 4,7,2 are the first 3 terms in the table.
