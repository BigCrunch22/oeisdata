%N A096090 Index of the first occurrence of n in A096089, or 0 if n never appears.
%C A096090 a(9) = 0. For any number with any 0 digits, A096089(n) >= 10. The only number with n digits and no zeros that can be multiplied by 9 to produce a number with the same number of digits is 111...1, so 9 cannot be achieved. A similar argument shows that a(n) = 0 for any n whose leading digit is 9. Note that a(89) = 1011199; probably every number whose leading digit is not 9 does occur in A096089. - _Franklin T.
