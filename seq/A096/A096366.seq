%N A096366 Known primitive friendly integers.
%C A096366 Friends m and n are primitive friendly iff they have no common prime factor of the same multiplicity.
%C A096366 There may be other primitive friendly integers within the range of those given, but they have yet to be calculated.
%C A096366 All perfect numbers are 2-primitive-friendly (since they are all products of distinct powers of 2 and distinct Mersenne primes). - _Daniel Forgues_, Jun 24 2009
%C A096366 A friendly integer can be both primitive and nonprimitive. For example, consider 30. First, 30 is friendly to 140, but this relation is nonprimitive, because it is 5 times the friendly pair {6, 28}. But then, 30 is also friendly to 6200, and this is a primitive pair (not a scaling of a smaller friendly pair). - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Dec 07 2022

%e A096366 While 6 and 28 are not coprime because they share the common factor 2, the factor 2 appears twice in 28 but only once in 6, so they are in the sequence.
