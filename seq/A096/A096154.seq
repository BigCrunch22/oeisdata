%N A096154 Number of tilings of {1...n} by translation and reflection of a single set.
%C A096154 a(n) counts the partitions of {1...n} with the property that all elements of the partition are congruent, modulo translation and reflection, to the same tile.
%C A096154 Two tilings that are reflections of each other are considered distinct. E.g. {{1,2,6},{3,7,8},{4,5,9}} and {{1,5,6},{2,3,7},{4,8,9}} are both included in the count for a(9). The first tile that allows more than one tiling for the same set without one being a reflection of the other is {1,2,7} on the span {1...12}.
%F A096154 a(n)-4 often seems to be a power of 2. - _Don Reble_
%e A096154 a(8)=13 because the following are the 13 tilings of {1...8}:
%e A096154 {{1},{2},{3},{4},{5},{6},{7},{8}} tile: {1}
%e A096154 {{1,2},{3,4},{5,6},{7,8}} tile: {1,2}
%e A096154 {{1,3},{2,4},{5,7},{6,8}} tile: {1,3}
%e A096154 {{1,5},{2,6},{3,7},{4,8}} tile: {1,5}
%e A096154 {{1,2,3,4},{5,6,7,8}} tile: {1,2,3,4}
