%N A096085 a(n) is the least positive integer such that for 1 <= k <= n, the concatenation of the k terms a(n-k+1) through a(n) is a multiple of k.
%C A096085 It suffices to check this for prime-power values of k. To see this, let k = a*b, where a and b are relatively prime. The concatenation of k terms can be viewed as a concatenation of a numbers, each of which is the concatenation of b terms. The first a-1 of these were previously chosen to be multiples of b, so if the last is also a multiple of b, then the concatenation of all k terms is a multiple of b. By the same argument, the concatenation of all k terms is a multiple of a and since a and b are relatively prime, it is a multiple of k. - _David Wasserman_, May 21 2007
%C A096085 a(n) exists for all n, because the Chinese Remainder Theorem shows that a d-digit solution must exist if 9*10^(d-1) >= A003418(n). - _David Wasserman_, May 21 2007
