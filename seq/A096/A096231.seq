%N A096231 Number of n-th generation triangles in the tiling of the hyperbolic plane by triangles with angles {Pi/2, Pi/3, 0}.
%C A096231 Or, coordination sequence for (2,3,infinity) tiling of hyperbolic plane. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 29 2015
%C A096231 The generation of a triangle is defined such that exactly one triangle has generation 0 and a triangle has generation n, n > 0, if it is next to a triangle with generation n-1 but not to one with lower generation.
%C A096231 The recursions were found by examining empirical data and have not been proved to be accurate for all n. The generating function was found by assuming that the recursions were accurate; it can be calculated from either recursion. We created a specialized program in Java for finding the sequences of generations for triangles with angles {Pi/p, Pi/q, Pi/r}, p, q, r > 1, that tile the Euclidean or hyperbolic plane; this program was used to calculate the sequence.
%C A096231 The g.f. (1+X)^2 * (1+X+X^2) / (1-X^2-X^3) follows from the Cannon-Wagreich paper, Prop. 3.1, so the g.f. and the recurrence are now a theorem, no longer conjectures, and the additional terms and the Mma program are now justified. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 29 2015
