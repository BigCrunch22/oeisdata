%N A096879 a(1) = 1; for n > 1: a(n) = least multiple m of n such that m is coprime to n+1 and the absolute difference of a(n) and a(n-1) is a prime distinct from all earlier such differences of consecutive terms.
%C A096879 Suggested by A096134.
%C A096879 Primes arising as absolute first differences are given in A096880.
%e A096879 a(8) has to be a multiple of 8; 16 is the smallest one that satisfies all conditions: 16 is coprime to 9, abs(a(7) - 16) = 19 is prime and distinct from all earlier absolute differences 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17. Hence a(8) = 16.
