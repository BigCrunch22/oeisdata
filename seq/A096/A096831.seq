%N A096831 Number of primes in the neighborhood with center = n-th primorial and radius = ceiling(log(n-th primorial)).
%C A096831 What is exceptional in such neighborhoods of primorials is that in most cases no primes occur, i.e., these zones are peculiarly poor or empty of primes!
%C A096831 Primes are scarce in these zones because log(A002110(n)) < prime(n), so A002110(n)+1 and A002110(n)-1 are the only numbers in the neighborhood that are not divisible by one of the first n primes. - _David Wasserman_, Nov 16 2007
%F A096831 a(n) = A096509(A002110(n)).
%e A096831 n=7: 7th primorial=510510; radius=14, a(7)=0 because there are no primes in the relevant neighborhood.
%e A096831 [1, 3], [4, 8], [26, 34], [2302, 2318] (around 2, 6, 30, 2310, respectively) are the only zones in which 2 primes were found.
