%N A096077 a(0)=0 and for n>0, a(n) is the smallest positive integer that cannot be derived by the adding or subtracting at most three terms with values in {a(0),...,a(n-1)} allowing repeats.
%C A096077 Stated in more concrete terms, a(n) is the smallest amount of a transaction that cannot be achieved with the transfer (in either direction) of at most 3 coins with values among the previous terms.
%e A096077 a(4)=17 because: 11=10+1, 12=10+1+1, 13=10+4-1, 14=10+4, 15=10+4+1, 16=10+10-4, but there is no way to create 17 using at most three values in {1,4,10}
