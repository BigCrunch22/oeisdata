%N A096135 Triangle read by rows which contains in row n that permutation of the n numbers T(n-1)+1..T(n) which yields a smallest multiple of n after concatenation. T(n) are the triangular numbers. If no such multiple exists, the row contains zeros.
%C A096135 Conjecture: No term is zero.
%e A096135 Terms a(7) to a(10) are 7,9,10,8 respectively, a permutation of 7,8,9 and 10, the next four numbers and 79108 is a multiple of 4.
%e A096135 The 4th row contains a permutation of 7, 8, 9 and 10, the four numbers up to and including T(4)=A000217(4)=10. The concatenations 78910, 78109 etc. are not multiples of 4, which leaves the concatenation 79108 as the only (and therefore minimal) candidate for the ordering of the numbers in the row.
