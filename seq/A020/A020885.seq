%N A020885 Ordered areas (divided by 6) of primitive Pythagorean triangles (with multiple entries).
%C A020885 Since squares are 0 or 1 under both mod 3 and mod 4, for the Pythagorean equation A^2 + B^2 = C^2 to hold, each of 3 and 4 divides either of leg A or leg B, so that area A*B/2 is divisible by 3*4/2 = 6. - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Apr 30 2004
%C A020885 From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jun 14 2015: (Start)
%C A020885 This sequence gives the area/6 (in some squared length unit) of primitive Pythagorean triangles with multiplicities modulo leg exchange. See the example.
%C A020885 This sequence also gives Fibonacci's congruous numbers divided by 24, with multiplicities and ordered nondecreasingly. See A258150.
%C A020885 (End)
%C A020885 It appears that this sequence gives the list of dimensions of irreducible unitary representations of the Lie group SO(5). - _Antoine Bourget_, Mar 30 2022
