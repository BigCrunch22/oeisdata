%N A020498 a(n) is the least number > a(n-1) such that there is no prime p for which a(1) through a(n) would contain all residues modulo p.
%C A020498 Conjecturally, a(n) is the smallest number such that n primes occur infinitely often among (x+a(1), ...,x+a(n)).
%C A020498 From _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 25 2024: (Start)
%C A020498 For a given prime p, if r is the only residue (mod p) not among {a(1), ..., a(n)} (mod p) for some index n, then no term of the sequence can be congruent to r (mod p).
%C A020498 (Instead of a(1...n), one can consider any collection of terms.) - Examples:
%C A020498 (1) p = 2, r = 0, n = 1: No term can be congruent to 0 (mod 2), i.e., even.
%C A020498 (2) p = 3, r = 2, n = 2: No term may be congruent to 2 (mod 3).
%C A020498 (3) p = 5, r = 0, n = 4: No term may be a multiple of 5.
%C A020498 (4) p = 7, r = 4, n = 6: No term may be congruent to 4 (mod 7).
%C A020498 (5) p = 11, r = 6, n = 11: No term may be congruent to 6 (mod 11). (End)

%e A020498 a(2) can't be 2 because otherwise for the prime p = 2, we would have {a(1), a(2)} == {0, 1} (mod p), a complete set of residues. (For the same reason, no other term can be even.) So a(2) = 3 is the smallest possible choice.
%e A020498 Similarly, a(3) must be odd but not congruent to 2 (mod 3) (*), otherwise {a(1), a(2), a(3)} would form a complete set of residues (mod 3). (* As before, this holds for all terms of the sequence.)
%e A020498   So 5 is excluded and the smallest choice is a(3) = 7. (End)
