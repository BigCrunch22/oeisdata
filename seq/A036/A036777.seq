%N A036777 Number of labeled rooted trees with a degree constraint (described in the comments below).
%C A036777 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jun 09 2019: (Start)
%C A036777 Quoting from p. 3 of Takacs (1993): "Denote by S_n* the set of all rooted trees with n labeled vertices. ... let us define R as a fixed set of nonnegative integers which always contains 0. Denote by S_n*(R) the subset of S_n* which contains all the trees in S_n* in which the degree of the root is in R and, if j is the degree of any other vertex of a tree, then j-1 \in R."
%C A036777 Quoting from p. 4 of Takacs (1993): "Theorem 2: The number of trees in S_n*(R) is |S_n^*(R)| = (n - 1)! Coeff. of x^(n-1) in ( Sum_{i \in R} x^i/i! )^n."
%C A036777 When R = {0,1,...,r}, the quantity |S_n*(R)|/n^(n-1) has a probabilistic interpretation related to the generalized birthday problem. Let us "put balls at random one by one in n boxes until one of the boxes contains r + 1 balls" (p. 4 in Takacs). We assume that every box has the same probability (i.e., 1/n). Then |S_n*(R)|/n^(n-1) is the probability that at least n balls are needed until the above process stops (i.e., until at least one of the n boxes contains r + 1 balls).

%F A036777 In Theorem 2 from p. 4 in Takacs (1993)--see the COMMENTS above--let R = {0,1,...,r} with r = 5. - _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jun 09 2019
%e A036777 Here a(n)/n^(n-1) is the probability that at least n balls are needed until one of the n boxes contains r + 1 = 6 balls (for the first time) when the n boxes are equally likely and we randomly distribute balls in the boxes (one by one) until one box gets r + 1 = 6 balls for the first time.  Clearly, a(n) = n^(n-1) for n = 1..6 for obvious reasons! But a(7) = 117642 < 117649 = 7^6. - _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jun 09 2019
