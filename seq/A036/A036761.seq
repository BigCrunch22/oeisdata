%N A036761 Number of refactorable integers (A033950) of binary order (A029837) n.
%C A036761 Since for any epsilon d(n) <= n^epsilon if n is large enough, a(n) does not grow very quickly.
%e A036761 {1} has binary order 0, {2} has binary order 1, no term has binary order 2, {8} has binary order 3, {9,12} have binary order 4, {18,24} have binary order 5, ...
%e A036761 The 8 numbers, between 65 and 128 (with binary order 7) which are divided by d(x) (A000005) are 72,80,84,88,96,104,108,128, so a(7)=8.
