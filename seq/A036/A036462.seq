%N A036462 Conjecturally, a power of 2 written in base 3 cannot have this many 0's.
%C A036462 Conjecture 1: Sequence A104320 never obtains the values in this sequence, so A104321(a(n)) is undefined. Conjecture 2: This sequence is infinite. - _David W. Wilson_, Oct 21 2016, edited by _Antti Karttunen_, Oct 29 2016
