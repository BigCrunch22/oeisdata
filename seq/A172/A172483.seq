%N A172483 a(n) is the number of cousin primes between p^2 and p*(p+4) where p is the n-th cousin prime A023200(n).
%C A172483 If you graph the order of the consecutive cousin primes along the x-axis (i.e., first pair of cousin primes, second, third,...) and the number of cousin primes in the sequence given above along the y-axis, a clear pattern emerges. As you go farther along the x-axis, greater are the number of consecutive cousin primes, on average, within the interval obtained. If one can prove that there's at least one consecutive cousin prime within each interval, this would imply that cousin primes are infinite. I suspect the number of consecutive primes within each interval will never be zero. Can you prove it?

%e A172483 The 1st pair of cousin primes is (3, 7), between 3^2=9 and 3*7=21 there is 2 cousin primes: 13 and 19. So a(1) = 2.
%e A172483 The 2nd pair of cousin primes is (7, 11), between 7^2=49 and 7*11=77 there is 1 cousin prime: 67. So a(2) = 1.
