%N A172486 Number of prime knots up to nine crossings with determinant 2n+1 and signature 6.
%C A172486 Adapted from Figure 6.6. The prime knots up to nine crossings separated by signature and determinant, p. 146, Cromwell. Fourth column of A172184. The fifth column of that table has only one entry, determinant = 9, signature = 8, knot is 9_1.
%D A172486 Peter R. Cromwell, Knots and Links, Cambridge University Press, 2004.
%e A172486 a(1) = 1 because the only prime knot with determinant 2*1+1=3 and s=6 is 8_19.
%e A172486 a(3) = 1 because the only prime knot with determinant 2*3+1=7 and s=6 is 7_1
%Y A172486 A002863, A172184, A172293, A172441, A172444.
