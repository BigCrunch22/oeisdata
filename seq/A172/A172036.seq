%N A172036 Prime partial sums of safe primes A005385.
%C A172036 a(2) = 23 is not only the 3rd partial sum of safe primes, but is itself the 4th safe prime. What are the next safe prime partial sums of safe primes [no more through 66869(41)]?
%F A172036 A000040 INTERSECTION A066869 = A000040 INTERSECTION = SUM[i=1..n]A005385 (i) = {p such that p prime and (p-1)/2 prime and p is an element of SUM[i=1..n]{p prime and (p-1)/2 prime}.}.
%e A172036 a(1) = 5 = A066869(1) is prime. a(2) = 23 = A066869(3) is prime. a(3) = 2267 = A066869(15) is prime.
%Y A172036 Cf. A005384, A005385, A066869.
