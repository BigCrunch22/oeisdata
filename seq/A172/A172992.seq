%N A172992 Maximal number of 4-tree rows in n-tree orchard problem in which the tree coordinates are integers.
%C A172992 From _Dmitry Kamenetsky_, Feb 23 2012: (Start)
%C A172992 At the end of 2011 there was a 3-month programming competition (http://infinitesearchspace.dyndns.org/orchardplanting) for this problem for n in the range [11,60]. Later there was an unofficial contest (http://infinitesearchspace.dyndns.org/content/orchard-mini-contest) for finding optimal solutions that can be placed on the smallest possible grids.
%C A172992 The terms in this sequences are the best known solutions to date and they may not be optimal.
%C A172992 Any solution that can be represented with integer coordinates can also be represented with real-valued coordinates, hence A172992(n)<=A006065(n). It is believed (but not proved) that some real-valued solutions cannot be represented by integer-valued solutions. For example A172992(16)=14, but A006065(16)=15. (End)

%e A172992 It is possible to place 10 points on an integer grid such that there are 5 straight lines with exactly 4 points lying on each line. Hence a(10) is 5. - _Dmitry Kamenetsky_, Feb 23 2012 (see the illustration by _Hugo Pfoertner_!)
