%N A172001 Nonsquare positive integers n such that Pell equation y^2 - n*x^2 = -1 has rational solutions but the norm of fundamental unit of quadratic field Q(sqrt(n)) is 1.
%C A172001 If the fundamental unit y0 + x0*sqrt(n) of Q(sqrt(n)) has norm -1, then (x0,y0) represents a rational solution to Pell equation y^2 - n*x^2 = -1. For n in this sequence, rational solutions exist but not delivered by the fundamental unit.
%F A172001 A positive integer n is in this sequence iff its squarefree core A007913(n) belongs to A031398.
