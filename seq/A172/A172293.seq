%N A172293 a(n) = number of prime knots up to nine crossings with determinant 2n+1 and signature 0.
%D A172293 Peter R. Cromwell, Knots and Links, Cambridge University Press, 2004. See p. 146, Fig. 6.6.
%e A172293 a(0) = 1 because the only prime knot with no more than 9 crossings with determinant 2*0+1=1 and s=0 is 0_1, the unknot.
%e A172293 a(2) = 1 because the only prime knot with no more than 9 crossings with determinant 2*2+1=5 and s=0 is 4_1, the figure-8 knot.
%e A172293 a(4) = 3 because the three prime knots with no more than 9 crossings with determinant 2*4+1=9 and s=0 are 6_1, 8_20, and 9_46.
