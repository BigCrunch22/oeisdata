%N A172020 Number of subsets S of {1,2,3,...,n} with the property that if x is a member of S then at least one of x-2 and x+2 is also a member of S.
%C A172020 It is interesting that, for k > 0, it appears that a(2k) is the square of A005251(k+2). (This has since been proved by _Andrew Weimholt_; see link.)
%C A172020 If we denote by d2 the second difference of {a(n)}, it appears that d2(2k) is the square of A005314(k).

%F A172020 _Andrew Weimholt_ has shown that a(2*n) = A005251(n+2) ^ 2, and a(2*n+1) = A005251(n+2) * A005251(n+3). (See the link.)
