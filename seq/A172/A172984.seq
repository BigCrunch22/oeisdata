%N A172984 For n <= 18, a(n) = Fibonacci(n) mod 5, using representatives {5,1,2,3,4} (i.e., 5 instead of the usual 0), and a(19)=2.
%C A172984 Previous name was: Sequence congruent to the Fibonacci sequence modulo 5, with 1 added to the last term. (Seen on "Mathnet.")
%C A172984 This sequence was used as a puzzle in the "Mathnet" portion of the children's mathematics television show Square One TV. In the series "Case of the Willing Parrot" (Episodes 201-205), the sequence was found in a pattern of tiles on a wall (see Example). The mystery was solved through the identification of the sequence, whose terms (with the exception of the last) were discovered to follow a pattern: after the two initial 1's, each term was the sum of the two previous terms, with 5 subtracted from any sum that exceeded 5. Thus, with the exception of the final term, the terms were the modulo-5 residues of the Fibonacci sequence (with a 5 representing each term that would have been a 0); see Formula section. After the anomalous final term was recognized as a clue, the physical removal of the upper tile of the rightmost column, which represented that final term, revealed a hidden key to a safe deposit box.

%F A172984 Recursive formula:
%F A172984   a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1,
%F A172984   a(n) = (a(n-1) + a(n-2) - 1) mod 5 + 1 for 3 <= n <= 18,
%F A172984   a(n) = (a(n-1) + a(n-2) - 1) mod 5 + 2 for n = 19.
%F A172984 Result expressed in terms of Fibonacci sequence:
%F A172984   a(n) = (Fibonacci(n) - 1) mod 5 + 1 for 1 <= n <= 18;
%F A172984   a(n) = (Fibonacci(n) - 1) mod 5 + 2 for n = 19.
