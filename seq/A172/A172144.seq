%N A172144 Number of chirotopes resulting from realizable uniform oriented matroids of rank 3 over a ground set of n elements modulo permutations.
%C A172144 The above numbers were obtained from random sprinkling of points into S^2.
%C A172144 The first five entries match those constructed from A018242, by explicitly applying each reorientation to a representative chirotope for each class of A018242, and grouping the chirotopes related by a permutation.
