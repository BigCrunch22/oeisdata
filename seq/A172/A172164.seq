%N A172164 Differences between numbers of triangles entirely contained in two consecutive turns of Pythagoras's snail (Theodorus spiral).
%C A172164 Conjecture : The terms are only 18,19,20,21 (From the first thousand turns, there are 2,3% of 18, 36,5% of 19, 46,2% of 20 and 15% of 21). No period found. Probably due to Pi transcendence.
%C A172164 From the first one hundred thousand turns, there are 1.662% 18s, 36.350% 19s, 48.393% 20s and 13.595% 21s. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Mar 31 2013
%C A172164 From the first 10 Million turns, there are 1.69208% 18s, 36.33984% 19s, 48.32320% 20s and 13.64488% 21s. - _Herbert Kociemba_, Jul 15 2013
%F A172164 The second forward difference of A072895. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Mar 31 2013
%e A172164 In the first turn, 16 triangles are complete. In the 2nd turn, there are 36 triangles completely included. The difference is 20.
