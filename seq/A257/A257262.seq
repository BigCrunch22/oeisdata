%e A257262 The factorial base representation (A007623) of 1 is "1", the least nonzero digit missing from that is 2, thus 1 is included in this sequence.
%e A257262 Likewise for 2, whose f.b.r. is "10", and also for  42 whose f.b.r. is "1300", the least nonzero digit missing from them is 2, thus also 2 and 42 are included in this sequence.
