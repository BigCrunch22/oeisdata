%N A257496 Doubly prime home primes (DPHP).
%C A257496 Take all the factors generated during the search for a home prime, put them together in the order found (just like when looking for the home prime itself) and test for primality. If it is a prime you have a DPHP.
%C A257496 Further terms are 74, 75, 95.
%C A257496 The number of iterations must be more than 1, preventing numbers such as 12 (12->2*2*3->223) from being a DPHP. - _Dana Jacobsen_, May 06 2015
%C A257496 An additional restriction is that a number is not a DPHP if it appears as the result as a product in any home prime search.  So 25 is not a DPHP because a(10) => 2*5->25 => 5*11->511 => 7*73->773, and 25 appears in the process. - _Dana Jacobsen_, May 23 2015
%C A257496 49 and 77 do not currently have known home prime sequences, hence it is unknown if they are in the DPHP sequence. - _Dana Jacobsen_, May 06 2015

%e A257496 Starting number 16 takes 4 iterations to get to the home prime of 31636373:
%e A257496 16 -> 2 * 2 * 2 * 2;
%e A257496 2222 -> 2 * 11 * 101;
%e A257496 211101 -> 3 * 11 * 6397;
%e A257496 3116397 -> 3 * 163 * 6373;
%e A257496 31636373 -> prime.
%e A257496 Now take all the factors found, in order: 2222211101311639731636373, a prime.
%e A257496 So 16 leads to a DPHP.
%Y A257496 Cf. A037274.
