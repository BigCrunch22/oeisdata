%N A257009 Number of finite sequences of positive integers with alternant equal to n.
%C A257009 The alternant of a sequence of positive integers (c_1, ..., c_r) with r>=3 is the positive integer [c_1, ..., c_r] - [c_2, ..., c_{r-1}], in which an expression in brackets denotes the numerator of the simplified rational number with continued fraction expansion having the sequence of quotients in brackets.  The alternant of (c_1) is c_1 and the alternant of (c_1, c_2) is c_1*c_2. There are finitely many sequences with given alternant >= 3. (There are infinitely many sequences with alternant 2 -- (2), (1,2), (2,1), and all sequences of the form (1,p,1).  It is for this reason that the offset is 3.)
%C A257009 The number of Zagier-reduced binary quadratic forms with discriminant equal to n^2-4 or n^2+4
%C A257009 The number of pairs of integers (h,k) with |k| < sqrt(D), k^2 congruent to D (mod 4), h > (sqrt(D) - k)/2, h exactly dividing (D-k^2)/4, where D=n^2+4 or n^2-4.
