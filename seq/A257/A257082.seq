%N A257082 a(n) is one sixth of the total number of free ends of 6 line segments expansion at n iterations (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A257082 The initial pattern consists of 6 straight line segments which are the radii of a hexagon. The next generations are scaled down by a factor of tan(Pi/6) and rotated by an angle of Pi/6. Their free ends are the ends of elements that do not contact or cross the other ones. Overlaps among different generations are prohibited. See illustration in the links.
