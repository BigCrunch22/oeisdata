%N A257334 Construct spiral of numbers on square grid as in Comments; sequence gives terms along the "3" arm.
%C A257334 Place numbers 2,3,4,5 clockwise around a grid point (see illustration in "Spiral" link). Divide grid into four spiral arms.
%C A257334 Extend each arm one step at a time, in rotation: first the 2 arm, then the 3 arm, then the 4 arm, then the 5 arm, then the 2 arm, etc.
%C A257334 Rule for extending: next term in arm is smallest number such that each cell in the grid is relatively prime to its four (N,S,E,W) neighbors. Inside an arm, the terms must be distinct.
%C A257334 Repetitions between arms are permitted.
%C A257334 The "2" arm is A257333, the "3" arm is the present sequence (A257334). The "4" arm begins 4,3,2,5, and thereafter agrees with the "2" arm. The "5" arm begins 5,2,3,4, and thereafter agrees with the "3" arm.
