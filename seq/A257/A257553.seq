%N A257553 Primes whose squares are not the sums of two consecutive nonsquares.
%C A257553 Primes of the form A257282(k).
%C A257553 2 is in this sequence, and an odd prime p is in the sequence iff either (p^2 - 1)/2 or (p^2 + 1)/2 is a square. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, May 07 2015
%C A257553 According to the Neretin comment in A257282, and as the primes of A001333 are in A086395, this is (apart from the 2) the same as A086395. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jan 31 2024
%e A257553 2 is in the sequence because it is prime and its square 4 is in A256944: 4 is not a sum of consecutive numbers.
%e A257553 3 is in the sequence because it is prime and its square 9 is in A256944: 9 = 2^2 + 5.
%e A257553 7 is in the sequence because it is prime and its square 49 is in A256944: 49 = 24 + 5^2.
%e A257553 5 is not in the sequence because neither 12 nor 13 is a square.
