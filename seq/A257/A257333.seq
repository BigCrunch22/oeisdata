%N A257333 Construct spiral of numbers on square grid as in Comments; sequence gives terms along the "2" arm.
%C A257333 Place numbers 2,3,4,5 clockwise around a grid point (see illustration in "Spiral" link). Divide grid into four spiral arms.
%C A257333 Extend each arm one step at a time, in rotation: first the 2 arm, then the 3 arm, then the 4 arm, then the 5 arm, then the 2 arm, etc.
%C A257333 Rule for extending: next term in arm is smallest number such that each cell in the grid is relatively prime to its four (N,S,E,W) neighbors. Inside an arm, the terms must be distinct.
%C A257333 Repetitions between arms are permitted.
%C A257333 The "2" arm is the present sequence (A257333), the "3" arm is A257334. The "4" arm begins 4,3,2,5, and thereafter agrees with the "2" arm. The "5" arm begins 5,2,3,4, and thereafter agrees with the "3" arm.
