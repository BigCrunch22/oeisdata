%N A257470 a(n+1) = least number not occurring earlier such that max{a(n), a(n+1)} >= 2 min{a(n), a(n+1)}; a(0) = 0.
%C A257470 Otherwise said, a(n+1) is either the smallest number not occurring earlier if this number is smaller than a(n)/2, or else a(n+1) is the least unused number >= 2 a(n).
%C A257470 This is a simpler variant of A139080. Here the well-definedness of the infinite sequence is guaranteed.
%C A257470 This is a permutation of the nonnegative integers. Indeed, any number m appears either "early" as successor of m/2, or "late" as successor a(n+1) of some a(n) >= 2m (in which case n+1 = 3k-1, see below).
%C A257470 After the two initial terms, the following 3-periodic pattern repeats: a(3k-1) = the smallest term not occurring earlier, a(3k) = 2 a(3k-1), and a(3k+1) = 2 a(3k), since at this point the smallest unused number is necessarily > a(3k)/2 = a(3k-1), and therefore, using that number, the maximum would be smaller than twice the minimum.
%C A257470 In spite of the simplicity of the pattern, it seems not easy to give an explicit formula of a(n), i.e., for a(3k-1), cf. formulas. I conjecture the following properties:
%C A257470 (i) For all k>0, a(3k+2) = a(3k-1)+2 except for k in S = {1, 8, 9, 13, 14, 22, 23, 31, 32, 40, 41, 49, 50,...} where a(3k+2) = a(3k-1)+1.
%C A257470 (ii) Let D = (7, 1, 4, 1, 8, 1, 8, 1, 8, 1, 8, 1, 8, ...) be the first differences of the sequence S. Then D(2k) = 1 for all k>0.
%C A257470 (iii) D(2k+1) = 4 or 8 for all k>0; except for the first one, the 4's always come twice in a row (e.g., for k in {8, 9}, {13, 14}, {22, 23}, ...).
%C A257470 (iv) The length of runs of 8's in the subsequence D(2k+1) are: 6 (k=2..7), 3 (k=10..12), 7 (k=15..21), 7 (k=24..30), 7 (k=33..39), 7 (k=42..48), 7 (k=51..57), 7 (k=60..66), 3 (k=69..71), 3 (k=74..76), 7,... It seems that except for the first two terms, this consists of runs of 7 of various length, but always interrupted by two 3's.

%F A257470 For all k>0, a(3k-1) = least number not occurring earlier; a(3k) = 2 a(3k-1); a(3k+1) = 2 a(3k).
%e A257470 After a(0)=0, a(1)=1 is the least unused number such that max{1,0} >= 2 min{1,0} = 0.
%e A257470 After a(2)=2, a(3)=4 is the least unused number such that max{2,4} >= 2 min{2,4} = 4.
%e A257470 After a(3)=4, a(4)=8 is the least unused number such that max{8,4} >= 2 min{8,4} = 8, because the only smaller unused number, 3, would not satisfy the requirement.
%e A257470 After a(4)=8, a(5)=3 is the least unused number such that max{8,3} >= 2 min{8,3} = 6.
