%N A257862 a(n) = n if n <= 3, otherwise a(n) is the smallest number not already used and relatively prime to a(n-1) such that the set of prime divisors of one of the numbers {a(n-2), a(n)} is a subset of the set of prime divisors of the other.
%C A257862 The sequence is an analog of the Yellowstone sequence A098550 with a more stringent condition on neighboriong terms at distance 2. However, we conjecture that, as with A098550, this is a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A257862 By definition, every pair of neighboring terms at distance 2 are strictly connected numbers as defined in comment in A257112.
