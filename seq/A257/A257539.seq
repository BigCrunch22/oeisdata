%N A257539 The smallest of the Matula numbers of the rooted trees that are isomorphic as trees to the rooted tree with Matula number n.
%C A257539 The Matula number of a rooted tree can be defined in the following recursive manner: to the one-vertex tree there corresponds the number 1; to a tree T with root degree 1 there corresponds the t-th prime number, where t is the Matula  number of the tree obtained from T by deleting the edge emanating from the root; to a tree T with root degree m>=2 there corresponds the product of the Matula numbers of the m branches of T.

%F A257539 a(n) = first entry in row n of A235121. The Maple program is based on this.
%e A257539 a(4) = 3. Indeed the rooted tree corresponding to the Matula number 4 is \/ . It is isomorphic as a tree only to itself and to the path tree P(3), rooted at one of its end-vertex; the Matula number of this tree is 3; min {3,4} = 3.
%e A257539 a(14)=12 because the Matula numbers of the rooted trees isomorphic as a tree to the rooted tree having Matula number 14 are: 12, 13, 14, and 17.
