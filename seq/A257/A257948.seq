%N A257948 Length of cycle in which n ends under iteration of sum-of-squares-of-two-digits map s_2.
%C A257948 If n has an even number of digits, say n = abcdef, the map is n->s_2(n):= (ab)^2+(cd)^2+(ef)^2. If n has an odd number of digits, say n = abcde, the map is n->s_2(n):= (a)^2+(bc)^2+(de)^2.
%C A257948 The following statements, densities and conjectures are based on calculations for n = 1...10000.
%C A257948 The map s_2 has fixed points 1, 1233, 3388. These are cycles of length 1. For the two 4-digit numbers see A055616. There are more numbers that end under iteration of s_2 in 1233 or 3388. Like a(3312) = 1233 or a(3388) = 8833.
%C A257948 The numbers that end under iteration of s_2 in 1 are called the bihappy numbers (A257795). They have a density of 0.33%.
%C A257948 It is conjectured that iterations of s_2 always end in cycles of finite period length and besides the 1-cycles there are ten different cycles of length > 1. The period lengths are 2, 2, 4, 5, 5, 6, 10, 14, 35 or 56.
%C A257948 Two cycles with a period length of 2: 5965 => 7706 => 5965, first number that reaches this 2-cycle is 51, the second 2-cycle is: 3869 => 6205 => 3869, first number that reaches this 2-cycle is 562. Density of both 2-cycles together is 0.9%.
%C A257948 Cycle with a period length of 4: 3460 => 4756 => 5345 => 4834 => 3460. First number to reach this 4-cycle is 342. Density is 0.69%.

First number to reach this 56-cycle is 5. Density 61.38%.
%C A257948 Density is calculated over s_2(1) till s_2(10000).

%e A257948 s_2^[9](2)= 35, because 2^2=4=>  4^2=16 => 16^2=256 =>   2^2+56^2=3140 =>   31^2+40^2=2561 =>  25^2+61^2=4346 => 43^2+46^2=3965 => 39^2+65^2=5746 => 57^2+46^2=5365=> 53^2+65^2= 7034. Nine iterations are needed to reach the 35-cycle.
%e A257948 s_2^[3](51)=2, since 51^2 = 2601 => 26^2+1^2 = 677 => 6^+77^2 = 5965 => 59^2+ 65^2 = 7706 => 77^2+6^2 = 5965. Three iterations are needed to reach the 2-cycle.
