%N A229140 Smallest k such that k^2 + l^2 = n-th number expressible as sum of two squares (A001481).
%C A229140 a(n) = 0 if A001481(n) is square. Conjecture: the values between two zeros are always distinct from each other.
%e A229140 The 6th number expressible as sum of two squares A001481(6) = 8 = 2^2 + 2^2, so a(6)=2.
