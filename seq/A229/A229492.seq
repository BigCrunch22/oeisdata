%N A229492 Conjectured number of positive even numbers having exactly n representations as the unordered sum of two odd primes.
%C A229492 This sequence is closely related to the Goldbach conjecture, which is equivalent to a(0) = 2; that is, there are no numbers other than 2 and 4 that have no representations as the sum of two odd primes. This is sequence A000974, except for the first two terms.
%e A229492 There are 3 even numbers with one representation: 6 = 3+3, 8 = 3+5, and 12 = 5+7. Hence, a(1) = 3.
%Y A229492 Cf. A000974 (using both even and odd primes).
%Y A229492 Cf. A002375 (number of representations of 2n as the sum of two odd primes).
