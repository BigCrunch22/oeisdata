%N A229205 Lucky numbers generated from squarefree numbers.
%C A229205 Follow same procedure that is used to produce the lucky numbers A000959 but start with squarefree numbers A005117 instead of natural numbers.
%e A229205 Start with squarefree numbers A005117 = (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 29, 30,...).
%e A229205 Delete every second number to get (1,_ 3,_ 6,_ 10,_ 13,_ 15,_ 19,_ 22,_ 26,_ 30, ...).
%e A229205 Since the next larger remaining number is 3, delete every 3rd number, to get (1, 3,_ 10, 13,_ 19, 22,_ 30, ...).
%e A229205 The next larger remaining number is 10, so delete every 10th term, etc. Note that "30" will remain in this sequence, but is not among the squarefree numbers indexed by lucky numbers, A229483. - _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 24 2013
