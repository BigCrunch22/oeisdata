%N A229769 Not of the form x^2 + P*y^2 for integers x > 0, y > 1, P a prime.
%C A229769 There are no terms <= 10^9 greater than a(3036) = 69808035, leading to the conjecture that the sequence is finite. If true, every sufficiently large number is expressible as x^2 + P*y^2 with x > 0, y > 1.

%e A229769 Since 17 can be expressed as 3^2 + 2 * 2^2, it is not in the sequence.
%e A229769 No such expression exists for 18, hence it is in the sequence.
%e A229769 Since 19 can be expressed as 1^2 + 2 * 3^2, it is not in the sequence.
