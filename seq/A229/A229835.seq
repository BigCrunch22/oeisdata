%N A229835 Number of ways to write n = (p - 1)/6 + q, where p is a prime, and q is a term of the sequence A000009.
%C A229835 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 1. Also, any integer n > 1 can be written as (p + 1)/6 + q, where p is a prime and q is a term of A000009.
%C A229835 We have verified this for n up to 2*10^8. Note that 26128189 cannot be written as (p - 1)/4 + q with p a prime and q a term of A000009. Also, 65152682 cannot be written as (p + 1)/4 + q with p a prime and q a term of A000009.
