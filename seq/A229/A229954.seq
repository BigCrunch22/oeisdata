%N A229954 The index of Simon's piecewise testability congruence, for words of length 2 over an n-letter alphabet.
%C A229954 Consider an alphabet with n letters, say {a_0, a_1, ... a_{n-1} }. For two words v and w over this alphabet, we say v embeds in w, or v is a subsequence of w, if v can be obtained from w by erasing some (occurrences of) letters.
%C A229954 Define two words to be 2-equivalent if they have the same subsequences of length up to 2. The n-th term of this sequence is the number of equivalence classes of this equivalence relation, when the size of the alphabet is n.

%e A229954 For n=1, with the alphabet {a_0}, representatives of the three equivalence classes are: empty word, a_0, a_0a_0.
