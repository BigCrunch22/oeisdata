%N A229618 Numbers that are the distance between a square and the next larger cube.
%C A229618 This is the range of the sequence A181138 (= least k>0 such that n^2+k is a cube). Note that this is not the same as A087285 = range of A077116 = difference between a cube and the next smaller square: If n^2+k = y^3 is the smallest cube above n^2, then n^2 is not necessarily the largest square below y^3, e.g., 9+18 = 27 = 3^3 is the least cube above 9 = 3^2, but 25 = 5^2 is the largest square below 27. Therefore the number 18 is in this sequence, but not in A087285.
%C A229618 See A077116 and A181138 and A179386 for motivations.
%C A229618 Apart from the leading 1, this is a subsequence of A106265, which does not require the square to be the next smaller one: For example, 23 = 27 - 4 = 3^3 - 2^2 is in A106265 but not in this sequence. A165288 is a subsequence of this one, except for the initial term.
%e A229618 a(1) = 1 = 1^3-0^2 (but this is the only solution to y^3-x^2 = 1).
%e A229618 a(2) = 2 = 27-25 (= 3^3-5^2), and this is the only solution to y^3-x^2 = 2.
%e A229618 The number 3 is not in the sequence since there are no x, y > 0 such that y^3-x^2 = 3.
%e A229618 a(3) = 4 = 8-4 (= 2^3-2^2) = 125-121 (= 5^3-11^2); these are the only two solutions to y^3-x^2 = 4, for all x>11, the minimal positive y^3-x^2 is 7.
