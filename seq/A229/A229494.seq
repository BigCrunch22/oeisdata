%N A229494 Lucky numbers generated from noncomposite numbers.
%C A229494 Result of application of "Ulam's sieve" (used to produce the lucky numbers A000959) to the noncomposite numbers A008578 instead of the naturals A000027.
%C A229494 The "Lucky numbers generated from primes", cf. A059987 = (2, 5, 11, 17, ...), form a disjoint subset, because they are a subset of the odd-indexed primes, while the present sequence is the union of {1} and a subset of the even-indexed primes. - _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 24 2013
%e A229494 Start with noncomposite numbers A008578 = (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, ...). Delete every 2nd number to get (1, 3, 7, 13, 19, 29, 37, ...). Since the next larger remaining number is 3, delete every 3rd term to get (1, 3, 13, 19, 37, ...). Then delete every 13th term, and so on.
