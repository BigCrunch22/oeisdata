%N A229072 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct natural numbers such that, for any number n in the sequence, the positions of the 1's in the binary representation of n are in the sequence, whereas the positions of the 0's are not.
%C A229072 The position 1 corresponds to the most significant bit.

%F A229072 a(n) = Sum_{a(i) <= n+1} 2^(n+1-a(i)), for any n>1, with a(1)=1.
%e A229072 1 has a 1 at position 1, and no 0's, hence 1 belongs to the sequence.
%e A229072 2 has a 0 at position 2, hence 2 cannot belong to the sequence.
%e A229072 3 has a 1 at position 2, as 2 cannot belong to the sequence, 3 cannot either.
%e A229072 4 has a 1 at position 1, and 0's at positions 2 and 3, hence 4 belongs to the sequence.
%e A229072 9 has 1's at positions 1 and 4, and 0's at positions 2 and 3, hence 9 belongs to the sequence.
