%N A229827 Number of circular permutations i_1,...,i_n of 1,...,n such that the n numbers i_1^2+i_2, i_2^2+i_3, ..., i_{n-1}^2+i_n, i_n^2+i_1 form a complete system of residues modulo n.
%C A229827 Conjecture: (i) a(p) > 0 for any prime p > 3. Moreover, for any finite field F(q) with q elements and a polynomial P(x) over F(q) of degree smaller than q-1, if P(x) is not of the form c-x, then there is a circular permutation a_1, ..., a_q of all the elements of F(q) with
%C A229827    {P(a_1)+a_2, P(a_2)+a_3, ..., P(a_{q-1})+a_q, P(a_q)+a_1}
%C A229827   equal to F(q).
%C A229827    (ii) Let F be any field with |F| > 7, and let A be a finite subset of F with |A| = n > 2. Let P(x) be a polynomial over F whose degree is smaller than p-1 if F is of prime characteristic p. If P(x) is not of the form c-x, then there is a circular permutation a_1, ..., a_n of all the elements of A such that the n sums P(a_1)+a_2, P(a_2)+a_3, ..., P(a_{n-1})+a_n, P(a_n)+a_1 are pairwise distinct.
%C A229827 Clearly, if a(n) > 0, then we must have 1^2+2^2+...+n^2 == 0 (mod n), i.e., (n+1)*(2n+1) == 0 (mod 6). Thus, when n is divisible by 2 or 3, we must have a(n) = 0.
%C A229827 It is well known that for any finite field F(q) with q elements we have sum_{x in F(q)} x^k = 0 for every k = 0, ..., q-2.
%C A229827 Verified for n < 256: a(n) > 0 iff n is not divisible by 2 or 3. - _Bert Dobbelaere_, Apr 23 2021
