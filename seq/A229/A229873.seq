%N A229873 An enumeration of all k-tuples containing positive integers.
%C A229873 The sequence pattern is an integer, n, followed by all k-tuples containing n, then (k+1)-tuples, etc., up to the n-tuples that have not yet appeared in the sequence. Directly before the integer n+1, therefore, we find the first occurrence of n^n n-tuples which contain the n^n permutations of 1 to n in lexicographic order. The cases n = 1 and n = 2 are degenerate as no tuples precede them; 1 is followed not by a tuple, but by 2, and 2 is followed by the tuple (1, 1), rather than (1, n) as with all other integers.
%C A229873 k-tuple clusters later in the sequence (k<n, i.e., after the initial k^k) are in sizes n^k-(n-1)^k; for example, the 2-tuples, when they occur, always appear in odd number sized clusters (2n-1, excluding the first four), and excluding the first 3^3, 3-tuples occur in clusters of 3n^2-3n+1.
%C A229873 Essentially, at each stage an n-hypercube of elements of size n is completed for each dimension up to the (n-1)-th, building on previous occurrences of the dimension, and then a hypercube for dimension n is begun to be built upon later.
%C A229873 Tuple sizes are in A229895.
