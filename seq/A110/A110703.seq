%N A110703 Numbers S with two neighboring run sums (sum of positive integer runs) S = a+(a+1)+..+b=(b+1)+(b+2)...+c, 0<a<b<c.
%C A110703 In other words, numbers n such that a list of consecutive numbers can be split into two parts in which their sums both equal n. - _A. D. Skovgaard_, May 22 2017
%C A110703 If the two runs overlap in one number, the runs are Friends and their sums are A110701. The sums are the difference of two triangular numbers A000217.
%C A110703 The subsequence where there is more than one possible splitting begins 105, 945, 1365, 2457, 2625, 3990, 5145, 8505, ... - _Jean-FranÃ§ois Alcover_, May 22 2017
%C A110703 a(n) seems to always be divisible by 3.- _A. D. Skovgaard_, May 22 2017. This is true. Sequence lists values of n = t(t+1)/2 - k(k+1)/2 = m(m+1)/2 - t(t+1)/2 with k < t < m. Since any triangular number must be of the form 3w or 3w+1, then there are two possibilities for n = 3w - k(k+1)/2 = m(m+1)/2 - 3w or n = 3w + 1 - k(k+1)/2 = m(m+1)/2 - 3w - 1. For first case, if k(k+1)/2 = 3u+1, there is no solution for m. Similarly for second case, if k(k+1)/2 = 3u, there is no solution for m. So always n must be divisible by 3. - _Altug Alkan_, May 22 2017

%e A110703 3 = 1+2 = 3, so 3 is a term.
%e A110703 15 = 4+5+6 = 7+8 so 15 is a term.
%e A110703 a(6) = 75 because 75 = 3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12 = 13+14+15+16+17.
