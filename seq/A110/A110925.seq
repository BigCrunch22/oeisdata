%N A110925 a(1) = 1; for n>1, a(n) is the smallest positive integer such that the continued fraction [a(1),a(2),a(3),...,a(n)] has numerator divisible by n.
%e A110925 a(5) = 4 because 4 is the smallest positive integer m such that the continued fraction [1,1,1,2,m] has numerator divisible by 5.
%e A110925 1 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/(2 + 1/4))) = 35/22 and 35 is divisible by 5.
%e A110925 [1,1,1,2,4,2,7,2,7,10,5,10] equals 4878960/3065089 and 12 divides 4878960.
