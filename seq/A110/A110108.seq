%N A110108 Conjectured values of n such that sigma(n)+sigma(k)=sigma(n+k) has no solution.
%C A110108 All k<10^10 have been checked. Note that this sequence appears to contain all powers of 3. It also contains 256 and 512, which are the only even numbers listed here.
%C A110108 All k<10^11 have been checked. 65 n values remain < 1000. - _Donovan Johnson_, Aug 29 2012
