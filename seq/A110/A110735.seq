%N A110735 Let n = a_1a_2...a_k, where the a_i are digits. a(n) = least multiple of n of the type b_1a_1b_2a_2...a_kb_{k+1}, obtained by inserting single digits b_i in the gaps and both ends; 0 if no such number exists.
%C A110735 Conjecture: no term is zero. For a k-digit number there are k+1 spaces and 10^(k+1) candidates, so the chances that one of them is a multiple of n increases with k on the one hand although the probability decreases because n becomes large.
%C A110735 It may well be the case that no term is zero, but the probabilistic argument above is not sufficient to establish it. It would imply that the probability of a zero is between e^-9 and e^-0.9 (see A110734 - exponents are -9 and -0.9 instead of -10 and -1 because leading digit cannot be zero). For n < 100, the largest term is a(67) = 56079; second largest is a(98) = 29988. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Sep 25 2006
