%N A110400 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 21; for n>2, a(n) is the least number whose neighboring digit difference forms a(n-1) such that a(n+1) also exists.
%C A110400 a(2) = 21 (chosen) and not 10 so that the sequence extends nontrivially.
%C A110400 A040115(a(n+1)) = a(n). - _David Wasserman_, Oct 02 2005
%e A110400 After 8421 two possible candidates are 91532 and 91576 but there is no number with digit difference 91576 hence the next term is 91532.
%e A110400 1031 is followed by 10032 because the absolute differences between the numbers 1, 0, 0, 3, 2 are 1, 0, 3, 1.
%Y A110400 Cf. A011557.
