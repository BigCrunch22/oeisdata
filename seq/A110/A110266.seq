%N A110266 Number of blocks of ON cells in n-th row of triangle generated by Wolfram's "Rule 30".
%C A110266 Old name was "Number of trees appearing at n-th generation of a black cell following Wolfram's Rule 30 cellular automaton."
%C A110266 At each generation, "looking back", one can see "behind", groups (sort of black isles) of contiguous black cells which after a while appear to be trees growing. It should be possible to describe each one of them in terms of trees theory.

%e A110266 a(1)=1 because one black cell;
%e A110266 a(2)=1 because there are now 3 contiguous black cell connected to the first one, which forms one only black surface;
%e A110266 a(3)=2 because two black cells are now connected to the preceding black surface and another black cell appears, which is isolated, so we have two separate black surfaces: 2.
