%N A110305 Factors of alternators which produce least alternating multiples.
%C A110305 An alternating integer is a positive integer for which, in base-10, the parity of its digits alternates. E.g. 121 is alternating because its consecutive digits are odd-even-odd, 1 being odd and 2 even. Of course, 1234567890 is also alternating. An alternator is a positive integer which has a multiple which is alternating.
%C A110305 For n congruent to 0 mod 20, a(n) is shown as zero to indicate that n is not an alternator.

%e A110305 a(13) is 4 because the least multiple of 13 which is alternating is 52, which is 13 * 4. Of course 13, 26 and 39 are not alternating. 52 is alternating because 5 is odd and 2 is even.
