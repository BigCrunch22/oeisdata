%N A110492 Number of values of k for k=1,2,3,...,n-1, such that n+k divides prime(n)+prime(k), where prime(n) denotes the n-th prime.
%C A110492 Surprisingly, the nonzero terms of the sequence seem to occur in well-defined intervals separated by increasingly long intervals of zero terms, with the position of one nonzero interval located at a value of n approximately 2.4 times that of the previous one. See the link for a graph of {a(n)} vs. Log(n) to the base 2.4, for n in {1,2,...,5000}. Further,each of the integer quotients (Prime[n]+ Prime[k])/(n+k) are the same throughout each interval of nonzero values of a(n) and in fact the values of the quotients are precisely the ordinal of that interval of nonzero values.

%e A110492 The first five primes are 2,3,5,7,11. We find that 5+1 does not divide 11+2, but 5+2 divides 11+3, 5+3 divides 11+5 and 5+4 divides 11+7. Therefore a(5)=3.
