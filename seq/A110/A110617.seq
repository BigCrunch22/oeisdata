%N A110617 The decimal expansion of 1/64532 (related to an optimal mixed strategy for Hofstadter's million dollar game).
%C A110617 Constants such as this one and .64532 have importance with respect to the efficient usage of resources of various types and the minimization of opportunity costs: According to the Mero source, if 100000 players are considering entering Hofstadter's/Scientific American's million dollar game, an optimal mixed strategy for maximizing the magazine's expected loss -- thus maximizing the expected gain for the common good of all 100000 players -- is for each player to preselect an integer from 1 through 64532 and roll a 64532-sided die. A player should enter the game if and only if that player rolls his or her preselected number, which, of course will occur with probability 1/64532. (With instead a 100000-sided die the probability that no one enters is "about 37%" (Mero).). The game pay-out to the single randomly-selected winner from the pool of entrants is defined to be inversely proportional to the number of entrants: 1000000 if one entry, 500000 if two entries, etc.
