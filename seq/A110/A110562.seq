%N A110562 Numbers n such that n in binary representation has a block of exactly a nontrivial pentagonal number of zeros.
%C A110562 a(n) is the index of zeros in the complement of the pentagonal number analog of the Baum-Sweet sequence, which is b(n) = 1 if the binary representation of n contains no block of consecutive zeros of exactly a nontrivial pentagonal number length A000326(i) for i>1; otherwise b(n) = 0.

%e A110562 a(1) = 32 because 32 (base 2) = 100000, which has a block of 5 = A000326(2) zeros.
%e A110562 a(2) = 65 because 65 (base 2) = 1000001, which has a block of 5 zeros.
%e A110562 64 is not in this sequence because, though 64 (base 2) = 1000000 has a block of 6 zeros, which has subblocks of 5 zeros, subblocks do not count.
%e A110562 2080 is in this sequence because 2080 (base 2) = 100000100000 has 2 blocks of 5 zeros, but we do not require only one such 5-zero block.
%e A110562 4096 is in this sequence because 4096 (base 2) = 1000000000000, which has a block of 12 = A000326(3) zeros, as do 8193 and many more.
%e A110562 4194304 is in this sequence because 4194304 (base 2) = 10000000000000000000000, which has a block of 22 = A000326(4) zeros.
