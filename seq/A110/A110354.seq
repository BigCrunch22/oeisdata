%C A110354 Original definition was: "Rearrangement of natural numbers such that digit 'd' occurs exactly 'd' times. Once a cycle is completed, i.e., 9 occurs 9 times. The same is repeated. The first number of the second cycle would be a number containing 1 once and which has not occurred earlier."
%C A110354 Why is the first number of the second cycle 13 and not 10? 10 is the next number after 1 that contains 1 once. How is the first number of the second cycle chosen? Also, in the given example it is stated "a(26) = 13 as 12 has already occurred", but 12 does not occur in the terms prior to a(26). - _Felix Fr√∂hlich_, Jul 26 2014
%C A110354 Comments from _Eric Angelini_, Jul 27 2014, in response to my asking him to investigate this sequence. (Start)
%C A110354 Murthy's seq is incoherent, for many reasons but two are sufficient:
%C A110354 <1> DEFINITION
%C A110354 "Rearrangement of natural numbers [...]"
%C A110354 ... No -- as "10" (or 100, 101, etc.) will never show up (because we would then not have zero "0"s)
%C A110354 <2> EXAMPLE
%C A110354 [...] "The second cycle starts at a(26) and a(26) = 13 as 12 has already occurred."
%C A110354 ... No, 12 has not occurred yet.
%C A110354 ... I propose the following definition and sequence ... (see A245628).
