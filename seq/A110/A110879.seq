%N A110879 Let a_0 = 1 and for n > 0, let a_n be the smallest positive integer not already in the sequence such that (a_0 + a_1 x + a-2x^2 + ....)^(1/3) has integer coefficients. (Hanna's A083349). Let f(n) = n th term in the present sequence. Then a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ... = (1-x)^f(1) (1-x^2)^f(2) (1-x^3)^f(3) ....
%C A110879 The preprint reference asks for a generating function for Hanna's sequence. Terms of present sequence are the exponents in an infinite product for Hanna's sequence. They were obtained from terms of Hanna's sequence with the cited theorem in Apostol and Mobius inversion.
