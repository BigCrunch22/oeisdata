%N A110745 a(n) is a number such that if odd positioned digits are deleted one gets n and if even positioned digits are deleted one gets n reversed. Counting is from the LSB side. The position of LSB is one.
%C A110745 Except for initial 0, rearrangement of numbers in A056524. They first differ at a(101) = 110011, while A056524(101) = 101101. If n has digits d_1 d_2 ... d_k, permute them to d_1 d_k d_2 d_{k-1} ... d_{floor(k/2)+1} and use that as index to A056524. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Jun 20 2006
