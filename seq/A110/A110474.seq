%N A110474 Numbers n such that n in binary representation has a block of exactly a nontrivial triangular number number of zeros.
%C A110474 a(n) is the index of zeros in the complement of the triangular number analog of the Baum-Sweet sequence, which is b(n) = 1 if the binary representation of n contains no block of consecutive zeros of exactly triangular number length >1; otherwise b(n) = 0. The sequence b(n) = 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,... is not yet in the OEIS and is too sparse to be attractively shown.
%C A110474 a(n) is in this sequence iff a(n) (base 2) has a block (not a subblock) of A000217(k) zeros for some k>1.

%e A110474 a(1) = 8 because 8 (base 2) = 1000, which has a block of 3 zeros, where 3 is a nontrivial triangular number (A000217(2)).
%e A110474 16 is not an element of this sequence because 16 (base 2) = 10000 which has a block of 4 zeros, which is not a triangular number (even though it has subblocks of the triangular number 3 zeros).
%e A110474 a(2) = 17 because 17 (base 2) = 10001, which has a block of 3 zeros (and is a Fermat prime).
%e A110474 a(4) = 34 because 34 (base 2) = 100010, which has a block of 3 zeros.
%e A110474 a(9) = 64 because 64 (base 2) = 1000000, which has a block of 6 zeros, where 6 is a nontrivial triangular number (A000217(3)).
%e A110474 2049 is in this sequence because 2049 (base 2) = 100000000001, which has a block of 10 zeros, where 10 is a nontrivial triangular number (A000217(4)).
%e A110474 65537 is in this sequence because 65537 (base 2) = 10000000000000001, which has a block of 15 zeros, where 15 is a nontrivial triangular number (A000217(5)) and happens to be a Fermat prime.
%e A110474 4194305 is in this sequence because, base 2, has a block of 21 zeros, where 21 is a nontrivial triangular number (A000217(6)),
