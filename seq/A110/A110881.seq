%N A110881 Starting a priori with the fraction 1/1, list n when the numerator and denominator are both prime for fractions built according to the rule: Add old top and old bottom to get the new bottom, add old top and twice the old bottom to get the new top.
%C A110881 k is the multiple 4 in the PARI code. The sequence of fractions found with the property that both numerator and denominator are prime is as follows.

%F A110881 Given a(0)=1,b(0)=1 then for i=1,2,.. a(i)/b(i) = (a(i-1)+2*b(i-1))/(a(i-1)+b(i-1)).
%e A110881 For k=2, n = 1, we start with fraction 1/1. The new bottom is old top + old bottom = 1+1 = 2. Then we add 1 (old top) + 2*1 (old bottom) to get 3, the new top. So our first fraction is 3/2. Since these are both prime, n=1 is the first entry. Continuing with this fraction 3/2, we repeat the rule. The new bottom is 3+2 = 5. Then we add 3 + 2*2 to get 7, the new top. So our second fraction is 7/5. Since both numerator and denominator are prime, n=2 is the second entry.
