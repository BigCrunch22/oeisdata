%N A110358 Beginning with 3, the least prime which is the product of one or more previous terms + 2.
%C A110358 Conjecture: The sequence is infinite.
%C A110358 Subbarao & Yip prove that if there is an integer m such that the equation Phi_2(x) = m has a unique solution, where Phi_2 is the 2nd Schemmel totient function (A058026), then x == 0 (mod a(n)^2) for each term in this sequence. They conjectured an analog to Carmichael's conjecture, that this equation has no unique solution to any integer m, and prove that any counterexample to this conjecture is > 10^120000, a bound calculated from the first 10000 terms of this sequence. A proof that this sequence is infinite would prove the conjecture. - _Amiram Eldar_, Mar 25 2017
