%N A110000 Minimal number of polygonal pieces in a dissection of a regular n-gon to an equilateral triangle (conjectured).
%C A110000 I do not know which of these values have been proved to be minimal.
%C A110000 Turning over is allowed. The pieces must be bounded by simple curves to avoid difficulties with non-measurable sets.

%e A110000 a(3) = 1 trivially.
%e A110000 a(4) <= 4 because there is a 4-piece dissection of an equilateral triangle into a square, due probably to H. Dudeney, 1902 (or possible C. W. McElroy - see Fredricksen, 1997, pp. 136-137). Surely it is known that this is minimal? See illustrations.
%e A110000 Coffin gives a nice description of this dissection. He notes that the points marked * are the midpoints of their respective edges and that ABC is an equilateral triangle. Suppose the square has side 1, so the triangle has side 2/3^(1/4). Locate B on the square by measuring 1/3^(1/4) from A, after which the rest is obvious.
