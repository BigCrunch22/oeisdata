%N A110456 Largest prime obtained by concatenation of parts of a distinct partition of n. 0 if no such number exist.
%C A110456 Conjecture a(n) = 0 only for n = 1, or n == 0 (mod 3), n is > 3. Subsidiary sequence (hard): Number of primes generated by concatenation of distinct partitions of n.
%e A110456 Distinct partitions of 10 are 10,(9,1), (8,2), (7,3),...(7,2,1),(6,3,1),(5,3,2),...(4,3,2,1), etc. (4231 is the largest number obtained as a concatenation of (4,2,3,1).
