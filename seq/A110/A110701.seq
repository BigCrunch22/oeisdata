%N A110701 Friendly run sums: numbers S with two run sums (sum of positive integer runs) that share one common number, i.e., S = a + (a+1) + ... + b = b + (b+1) + ... + c with a < b < c.
%C A110701 The sums are the difference of two triangular numbers A000217. The common numbers themselves are A094550. The sums, n > 0, are n = (b-a+1)(a+b)/2 = (b+c)(c-b+1)/2 where b^2 + a - a^2 = c^2 + c - b^2, is solvable in integers for 0 < a < b < c. Since the runs have something in common, they are "friends". The series of sums *without* the common number is A110702. The numbers common to the two runs are A094550.

%e A110701 2 + 3 + 4 = 4 + 5 share the common number 4. The sum of both is 9 and this is the smallest such sum with a common "friend" (4), so a(1)=9.
