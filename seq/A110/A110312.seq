%N A110312 Minimal number of polygonal pieces in a dissection of a regular n-gon to a square (conjectured).
%C A110312 I do not know which of these values have been proved to be minimal. (Probably only a(4)!).
%C A110312 Turning over is allowed. The pieces must be bounded by simple curves to avoid difficulties with non-measurable sets.
%C A110312 Dissecting a regular n-gon to a rectangle. Comments from _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 16 2023. (Start)
%C A110312 Let r(n) be the minimal number of polygonal pieces in a dissection of a regular n-gon to a rectangle. A rectangle of any proportions will do. Apart from changing "square" to "rectangle", the rules are the same as for the present sequence. Obviously r(n) <= a(n).
%C A110312 In an email of May 10 2023, Adam Gsellman gave two dissections (see links) showing that r(8) <= 4, saving one piece over the best octagon-to-square dissection presently known, and in subsequent emails he showed that r(5) <= 4, which is two pieces better than what is probably the best pentagon-to-square dissection, and r(7) <= 6. I showed that r(12) <= 5.
%C A110312 It is clear that r(3) = 2, r(4) = 1, and r(6) <= 3. The sequence r(n) begins (see links):
%C A110312   r(3) = 2, r(4) = 1, r(5) <= 4, r(6) <= 3, r(7) <= 6, r(8) <= 4, r(9) <= 9, r(10) <= 7, r(11) <= 10, r(12) <= 5, ...
%C A110312 If there were proofs that r(5) = 4 and r(6) = 3 this sequence could have its own entry. (End)

%e A110312 a(3) <= 4 because there is a 4-piece dissection of an equilateral triangle into a square, due probably to H. Dudeney, 1902 (or possible C. W. McElroy - see Fredricksen, 1997, pp. 136-137). Surely it is known that this is minimal? See illustrations.
%e A110312 Coffin gives a nice description of this dissection. He notes that the points marked * are the midpoints of their respective edges and that ABC is an equilateral triangle. Suppose the square has side 1, so the triangle has side 2/3^(1/4). Locate B on the square by measuring 1/3^(1/4) from A, after which the rest is obvious. See the Sloane-Vaishampayan paper for another description of this construction, with coordinates.
%e A110312 a(4) = 1 trivially.
%e A110312 a(5) <= 6 since there is a 6-piece dissection of a regular pentagon into a square, due to R. Brodie, 1891 - see Fredricksen, 1995, p. 120. Certainly a(5) >= 5. Is it known that a(5) = 5 is impossible?
%e A110312 a(6) <= 5 since there is a 5-piece dissection of a regular hexagon into a square, due to P. Busschop, 1873 - see Fredricksen, 1995, p. 117). (See illustration.) Is it known that a(6) = 4 is impossible?
%e A110312 a(7) <= 7 since there is a 7-piece dissection of a regular heptagon into a square, due to G. Theobald, 1995 - see Fredricksen, 1995, p. 128). Is it known that a(7) = 6 is impossible?
%e A110312 a(8) <= 5 since there is a 5-piece dissection of a regular octagon into a square, due to G. Bennett, 1926 - see Fredricksen, 1995, p. 150). Is it known that a(8) = 4 is impossible?
%e A110312 a(9) <= 9 since there is a 9-piece dissection of a regular 9-gon into a square, due to G. Theobald, 1995 - see Fredricksen, 1995, p. 132). Is it known that a(9) = 8 is impossible?
