%N A110702 Numbers S with two runsums (sum of positive integer runs) where the 2 runs are separated by a single number gap (b), i.e., S = a + (a+1) + ... + (b-1) = (b+1) + ... + c with a < b-1, b < c.
%C A110702 The sums are the difference of two triangular numbers A000217. The sum series where the missing number is included is A110701. The numbers in the gap between the two runs are A094550.
