%N A110874 Number of prime factors of 2 + n^(n+1) counted with multiplicity.
%C A110874 Compared with A110676, number of prime factors with multiplicity of 2 + n^(n+1), this seems to have an unlimited number of primes (n = 1, 3, 15, ...) and semiprimes (n = 2, 5, 6, 9, 27, ...). Of course, n even gives n | a(n).

%F A110874 a(n) = A001222(1 + A110567(n)) = A001222(2 + A007778(n)) = A001222(2 + n^(n+1)).
%e A110874 a(1) = 1 because 2 + 1^2 = 3 is prime (one prime factor).
%e A110874 a(2) = 2 because 2 + 2^3 = 10 = 2 * 5 is semiprime (two prime factors).
%e A110874 a(3) = 1 because 2 + 3^4 = 83 is prime.
%e A110874 a(4) = 5 because 2 + 4^5 = 1026 = 2 * 3^3 * 19 has five prime factors (3 has multiplicity of 3).
%e A110874 a(5) = 2 because 2 + 5^6 = 15627 = 3 * 5209 is semiprime (two prime factors).
%e A110874 a(6) = 2 because 2 + 6^7 = 279938 = 2 * 139969 is semiprime (two prime factors).
%e A110874 a(15) = 1 because 2 + 15^16 = 6568408355712890627 is prime. What is the next prime?
