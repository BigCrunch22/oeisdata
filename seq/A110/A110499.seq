%N A110499 Largest k such that n is the highest power in the factorization of binomial(2k,k).
%C A110499 Checked all k < 10^8. a(1) has been proved. a(2) and a(3) are conjectured.
%C A110499 Checked all k < 10^9. a(4) is at least 537927682. - _T. D. Noe_, Jul 27 2005
%e A110499 a(1)=4 because binomial(8,4) is the largest squarefree central binomial coefficient. a(2)=1056 because binomial(2112,1056) is the largest cubefree.
%Y A110499 Cf. A110495 (n such that binomial(2n, n) is cubefree).
%K A110499 bref,nonn
%O A110499 1,1
