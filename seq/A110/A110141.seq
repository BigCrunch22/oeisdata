%N A110141 Triangle, read by rows, where row n lists the denominators of unit fraction coefficients of the products of {c_k}, in ascending order by indices of {c_k}, in the coefficient of x^n in exp(Sum_{k>=1} c_k/k*x^k).
%C A110141 Row n starts with n!, after which the following pattern holds. When terms of row n are divided by a list of factorials, with (n-j-1)! repeated A002865(j+1) times in the list as j=1..n-1, the result is the initial terms of A110142. E.g., row 6 is: {720,48,18,16,8,6,5,48,8,18,6}; divide by respective factorials: {6!,4!,3!,2!,2!,1!,1!,0!,0!,0!,0!} with {4!,3!,2!,1!,0!} respectively occurring {1,1,2,2,4} times (A002865), yields the initial terms of A110142: {1,2,3,8,4,6,5,48,8,18,6}.
%C A110141 The term of the sequence corresponding to the product c_1^{n_1}c_2^{n_2}...c_k^{n_k} is equal to the number of elements in the centralizer of a permutation of n_1+2n_2+...+kn_k elements whose cycle type is 1^{n_1}2^{n_2}...k^{n^k}. (This fact is very standard, in particular, for the theory of symmetric functions.) - _Vladimir Dotsenko_, Apr 19 2009
%C A110141 Multiplying the values of row n by the corresponding values in row n of A102189, one obtains n!. - _Jaimal Ichharam_, Aug 06 2015
%C A110141 a(n,k) is the number of permutations in S_n that commute with a permutation having cycle type "k".  Here, the cycle type of an n-permutation pi is the vector (i_1,...,i_n) where i_j is the number of cycles in pi of length j.  These A000041(n) vectors can be ordered in reverse lexicographic order.  The k-th cycle type is the k-th vector in this ordering. - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Jan 18 2019

%F A110141 Number of terms in row n is A000041(n) (partition numbers). The unit fractions of each row sum to unity: Sum_{k=1..A000041(n)} 1/T(n, k) = 1.
%F A110141 a(n,k) = n!/A181897(n,k). - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Jan 18 2019
