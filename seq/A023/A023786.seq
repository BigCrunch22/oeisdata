%N A023786 Katadromes: digits in base 4 are in strict descending order.
%C A023786 No more terms are possible because, although infinitely many numbers have base 4 digits in descending order, like 256, none beyond 228 can have them in strictly descending order. - _Alonso del Arte_, Feb 08 2019
%e A023786 228 in base 4 is 3210. Since those digits are in strictly descending order, 228 is in the sequence.
