%N A023186 Lonely (or isolated) primes: increasing distance to nearest prime.
%C A023186 Erdős and Suranyi call these reclusive primes and prove that there are an infinite number of them. They define these primes to be between two primes. Hence their first term would be 3 instead of 2. Record values in A120937. - _T. D. Noe_, Jul 21 2006

%e A023186 The nearest prime to 23 is 4 units away, larger than any previous prime, so 23 is in the sequence.
%e A023186 The prime a(4) = A120937(3) = 53 is at distance 2*3 = 6 from its neighbors {47, 59}. The prime a(5) = A120937(4) = A120937(5) = A120937(6) = 211 is at distance 2*6 = 12 from its neighbors {199, 223}. Sequence A120937 requires the terms to have 2 neighbors, therefore its first term is 3 and not 2. - _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 28 2015
