%N A205648 Self-locating strings within e: numbers n such that the string n is at position n (after the decimal point) in decimal digits of e.
%C A205648 a(7) is greater than 10^9.
%C A205648 Heuristically (assuming e is 10-normal and in the absence of any 'conspiracy' amongst the digits) about 1 - exp(-0.9) = 59.3...% of the time there is some d-digit number in this sequence, and a(n) is on the order of 12.9...^(n + o(1)). [_Charles R Greathouse IV_, Mar 16 2012]
