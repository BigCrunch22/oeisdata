%N A205669 "Fairly optimal" shellsort sequence for reverse-sorting an ascending sequence of size N=64.
%C A205669 This is a fairly optimal sequence for reverse-sorting an ascending list where N = 64. Requires 4.125*N comparisons. 4.125 is approximately equal to 2.28*log_10(64). The operation performed requires a defined, substantial and certainly nontrivial amount of work which is repeatable for a list of any size.
%D A205669 Sequence A204772 where N=128.
