%N A205670 Possibly optimal shellsort sequence for reverse-sorting an ascending list of size N=32.
%C A205670 This is a (possibly) optimal sequence for reverse-sorting an ascending list where N = 32. Requires 3.313*N comparisons. 3.313 is approximately equal to 2.21*log_10(32). The operation performed requires a defined, substantial and certainly nontrivial amount of work which is repeatable for a list of any size.
%D A205670 Sequences A204772 where N=128 and A205669 where N=64.
