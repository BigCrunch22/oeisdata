%N A302663 Lexicographically first sequence of distinct terms such that the absolute differences |a(n) - a(n+1)| are A002113(n+1), where A002113 is "the palindromes in base 10".
%C A302663 The sequence starts with a(1) = 1 and is always extended with the smallest integer not yet present that doesn't lead to a contradiction.
