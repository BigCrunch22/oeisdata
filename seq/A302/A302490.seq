%N A302490 Fewest number of distinct prime factors in any product of a_1*a_2*...*a_t where n = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_t = A006255(n) and the product is square.
%C A302490 a(n^2) = A001221(n).
%e A302490 a(14) = 4 because 14 * 15 * 16 * 18 * 20 * 21 has four distinct prime factors (2, 3, 5, and 7) and no other square product of a strictly increasing sequence starting at 14 and ending at 21 has fewer distinct prime factors.
%Y A302490 Cf. A001221, A006255, A280244.
