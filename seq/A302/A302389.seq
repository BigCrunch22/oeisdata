%N A302389 A fractal-like sequence: erasing all pairs of contiguous terms that don't have a digit in common leaves the sequence unchanged.
%C A302389 The sequence is fractal-like as it embeds an infinite number of copies of itself.
%C A302389 The sequence was built according to these rules (see, in the Example section, the parenthesization technique):
%C A302389   1) no overlapping pairs of parentheses;
%C A302389   2) always start the content inside a pair of parentheses with the smallest integer X > 1 not yet present inside another pair of parentheses;
%C A302389   3) always end the content inside a pair of parentheses with the smallest integer Y > 1 not yet present inside another pair of parentheses such that X and Y have no digit in common;
%C A302389   4) after a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 2, always try to extend the sequence with a duplicate > 2 of the oldest term of the sequence not yet duplicated; if this leads to a contradiction, open a new pair of parentheses.

%e A302389 Parentheses are added around each pair of terms that have no digit in common:
%e A302389 (1,2),(12,3),(13,4),(14,5),(15,6),(16,7),(17,8),(18,9),(19,20),(10,22),(21,30),(23,11),1,(31,24),2,12,(25,33),3,13,(32,40),4,14,
%e A302389 Erasing all the parenthesized contents yields
%e A302389 (...),(....),(....),(....),(....),(....),(....),(....),(.....),(.....),(.....),(.....),1,( .....),2,12,( .....),3,13,( .....),4,14,
%e A302389 We see that the remaining terms slowly rebuild the starting sequence.
%Y A302389 For other erasing criteria, cf. A303845 (prime by concatenation), A303948 (pair sharing a digit), A274329 (pair summing up to a prime).
