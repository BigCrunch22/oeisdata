%N A302501 Lexicographically first sequence of distinct terms such that any set of six successive digits can be reordered as {d, d+1, d+2, d+3, d+4, d+5}, d being the smallest of the six digits.
%C A302501 As the digit 0 has no predecessor and the digit 9 has no successor here, sets of successive digits like {4,3,2,1,0,9} and {5,6,7,8,9,0} are forbidden.
%e A302501 Terms a(1) to a(10) are obvious;
%e A302501 a(11) is 45 because 45 is the smallest integer not yet in the sequence such that the elements of the sets {5,6,7,8,9,4} and {6,7,8,9,4,5} are six consecutive digits;
%e A302501 a(12) is 67 because 67 is the smallest integer not yet in the sequence such that the elements of the sets {7,8,9,4,5,6} and {8,9,4,5,6,7} are six consecutive digits;
%e A302501 a(13) is 83 because 83 is the smallest integer not yet in the sequence such that the elements of the sets {9,4,5,6,7,8} and {4,5,6,7,8,3} are six consecutive digits;
%e A302501 etc.
%Y A302501 Cf. A228326 for the same idea with sets of two digits, A302173 (sets of three digits), A302499 (sets of four digits) and A302500 (sets of five digits).
