%N A302927 Half-cumulants of a Fibonacci-geometric probability distribution.
%C A302927 If F(k) is the k-th Fibonacci number A000045(k), then p(k)=F(k-1)/2^k is a normalized probability distribution on the positive integers.
%C A302927 For example, it is the probability that k coin tosses are required to get two heads in a row, or the probability that a random series of k bits has its first two consecutive 1's at the end.
%C A302927 The g.f. for this distribution is g(x) = x^2/(4-2x-x^2) = (1/4)x^2 + (1/8)x^3 + (1/8)x^4 + (3/32)x^5 + ....
%C A302927 The cumulants of this distribution, defined by the cumulant e.g.f. log(g(e^x)), appear to be integers. They form sequence A302926.
%C A302927 The cumulants appear to be even for n >= 0. Dividing them by 2 gives this sequence.
%C A302927 The n-th moments about zero of this distribution, known as raw moments, are defined by a(n) = Sum_{k>=1} (k^n)p(k). They also appear to be integers and form sequence A302922.
%C A302927 For n >= 1, the raw moments also appear to be even. Dividing them by 2 gives sequence A302923.
%C A302927 The central moments (i.e., the moments about the mean) also appear to be integers. They form sequence A302924.
%C A302927 For n >= 1, the central moments appear to be even. Dividing them by 2 gives sequence A302925.
%C A302927 Note: Another probability distribution on the positive integers that has integral moments and cumulants is the geometric distribution p(k)=1/2^k. The sequences related to these moments are A000629, A000670, A052841, and A091346.

%F A302927 E.g.f.: (1/2)*log(g(e^x)) where g(x) = x^2/(4-2*x-x^2) is the g.f. for the probability distribution.
%e A302927 a(0)=0 is half the 0th cumulant of the distribution. The 0th cumulant is always zero.
%e A302927 a(1)=3 is half the 1st cumulant, which is half the mean.
%e A302927 a(2)=11 is half the 2nd cumulant, which is half the variance.
