%N A302500 Lexicographically first sequence of distinct terms such that any set of five successive digits can be reordered as {d, d+1, d+2, d+3, d+4}, d being the smallest of the five digits.
%C A302500 As the digit 0 has no predecessor and the digit 9 has no successor here, sets of successive digits like {3,2,1,0,9} and {6,7,8,9,0} are forbidden.

%e A302500 Terms a(1) to a(10) are obvious;
%e A302500 a(11) is 56 because 56 is the smallest integer not yet in the sequence such that the elements of the sets {6,7,8,9,5} and {7,8,9,5,6} are five consecutive digits;
%e A302500 a(12) is 78 because 78 is the smallest integer not yet in the sequence such that the elements of the sets {8,9,5,6,7} and {9,5,6,7,8} are five consecutive digits;
%e A302500 a(13) is 45 because 45 is the smallest integer not yet in the sequence such that the elements of the sets {5,6,7,8,4} and {6,7,8,4,5} are five consecutive digits;
%e A302500 etc.
%Y A302500 Cf. A228326 for the same idea with sets of two digits, A302173 for sets of three digits and A302499 for sets of four digits.
