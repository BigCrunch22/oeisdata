%N A302589 The digital sum of a(n) is not a substring of a(n+1), a(n+1) being the smallest integer not yet present in the sequence that doesn't lead to a contradiction.
%C A302589 a(1) = 1, and for n > 1 a(n) is the smallest integer not yet present in the sequence such that the digital sum of a(n-1) is not a substring of the decimal digits of a(n).

%e A302589 The digital sum of 1 is 1, so a(2) = 2 is the first unused number not containing a "1"; the digital sum of 2 is 2, so a(3) = 3 is the first unused number not containing a "2"; ...; the digital sum of 10 is 1, so a(11) = 20 is the first unused number not containing a "2" (2 is already used); etc.
%Y A302589 Cf. A173821 (where a(n) IS a substring of a(n+1)).
