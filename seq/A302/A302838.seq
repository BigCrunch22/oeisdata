%N A302838 Values of A000010(m) where the value and least solution m are both divisible by the number of solutions of A000010(m) = A000010(x).
%C A302838 For known terms the number of solutions is prime.
%C A302838 All known terms are nonsquarefree.
%F A302838 0 = A000010(m) mod #{A000010(m) = A000010(x)} = A000010(m) mod min({A000010(m) = A000010(x)}).
%e A302838 20 is a term because 25 is the least solution of 20 = A000010(x) and the number of solutions 5, divides 20 and 25.
%e A302838 204 is a term because 309 is the least solution of 204 = A000010(x) and the number of solutions 3, divides 204 and 309.
