%N A302799 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct terms such that adding 10 to each term produces a new sequence that has exactly the same succession of digits as the present one.
%C A302799 The sequence starts with a(1) = 1 and is always extended with the smallest integer not yet present that doesn't lead to a contradiction.

%e A302799     1 = a(1) is replaced by   1 + 10 =  11
%e A302799    12 = a(2) is replaced by  12 + 10 =  22
%e A302799     2 = a(3) is replaced by   2 + 10 =  12
%e A302799   121 = a(4) is replaced by 121 + 10 = 131
%e A302799     3 = a(5) is replaced by   3 + 10 =  13
%e A302799    11 = a(6) is replaced by  11 + 10 =  21
%e A302799    32 = a(7) is replaced by  32 + 10 =  42
%e A302799    14 = a(8) is replaced by  14 + 10 =  24
%e A302799 etc.
%e A302799 We see that the first and the last column here (which are respectively the terms of the present sequence and the terms of the transformed one) share the same succession of digits (so far): 1,1,2,2,1,2,1,3,1,1,3,2,1,4,2,2,4,...
%Y A302799 Cf. A302656 for another transformation in the same spirit that preserves the succession of digits in the sequence.
