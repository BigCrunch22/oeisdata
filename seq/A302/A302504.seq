%N A302504 Lexicographically first sequence of distinct terms such that any set of nine successive digits can be reordered as {d, d+1, d+2, d+3, d+4, d+5, d+6, d+7, d+8}, d being the smallest of the nine digits.
%C A302504 As the digit 0 has no predecessor and the digit 9 has no successor here, sets of successive digits like {7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,9} and {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0} are forbidden.

%e A302504 Terms a(1) to a(10) are obvious;
%e A302504 a(11) is 12 because 12 is the smallest integer not yet in the sequence such that the elements of the sets {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1} and {3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2} are nine consecutive digits;
%e A302504 a(12) is 34 because 34 is the smallest integer not yet in the sequence such that the elements of the sets {4,5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3} and {5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4} are nine consecutive digits;
%e A302504 a(13) is 56 because 56 is the smallest integer not yet in the sequence such that the elements of the sets {6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4,5} and {7,8,9,1,2,3,4,5,6} are nine consecutive digits;
