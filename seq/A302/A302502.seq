%N A302502 Lexicographically first sequence of distinct terms such that any set of seven successive digits can be reordered as {d, d+1, d+2, d+3, d+4, d+5, d+6}, d being the smallest of the seven digits.
%C A302502 As the digit 0 has no predecessor and the digit 9 has no successor here, sets of successive digits like {5,4,3,2,1,0,9} and {4,5,6,7,8,9,0} are forbidden.
%e A302502 Terms a(1) to a(10) are obvious;
%e A302502 a(11) is 34 because 34 is the smallest integer not yet in the sequence such that the elements of the sets {4,5,6,7,8,9,3} and {5,6,7,8,9,3,4} are seven consecutive digits;
%e A302502 a(12) is 56 because 56 is the smallest integer not yet in the sequence such that the elements of the sets {6,7,8,9,3,4,5} and {7,8,9,3,4,5,6} are seven consecutive digits;
%e A302502 a(13) is 78 because 78 is the smallest integer not yet in the sequence such that the elements of the sets {8,9,3,4,5,6,7} and {9,3,4,5,6,7,8} are seven consecutive digits;
%e A302502 etc.
%Y A302502 Cf. A228326 for the same idea with sets of two digits, A302173 (sets of three digits), A302499 (sets of four digits), A302500 (sets of five digits) and A302501 (sets of six digits).
