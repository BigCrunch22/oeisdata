%N A302173 Lexicographically first sequence of distinct terms such that any set of three successive digits can be reordered as {d, d+1, d+2}, d being the smallest of the three digits.
%C A302173 As the digit 0 has no predecessor and the digit 9 has no successor here, sets of successive digits like {1,0,9} and {8,9,0} are forbidden.

%e A302173 Terms a(1) to a(10) are obvious;
%e A302173 a(11) is 78 because 78 is the smallest integer not yet in the sequence such that the elements of the sets {8,9,7} and {9,7,8} are three consecutive digits;
%e A302173 a(12) is 67 because 67 is the smallest integer not yet in the sequence such that the elements of the sets {7,8,6} and {8,6,7} are three consecutive digits;
%e A302173 a(13) is 56 because 56 is the smallest integer not yet in the sequence such that the elements of the sets {6,7,5} and {7,5,6} are three consecutive digits;
%e A302173 etc.
%Y A302173 Cf. A228326 for the same idea with sets of two digits.
