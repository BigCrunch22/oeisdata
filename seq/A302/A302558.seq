%N A302558 For any n > 0 and m > 1, let d_m(n) be the distance from n to the nearest power of a number <= m (i.e., the distance to the nearest number of the form x^k with x <= m and k >= 0); a(n) = Sum_{i > 1} d_i(n).
%C A302558 For any n > 1 and m >= n, d_m(n) = 0, hence the series in the name contains only finitely many nonzero terms and is well defined.
%C A302558 The set of local minima (i.e., indices n > 1 where a(n) < min(a(n-1), a(n+1))) seem to correspond to A001597 minus {1, 9}.
