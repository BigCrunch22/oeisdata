%N A302403 Generalized chopsticks sequence (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A302403 Consider a one-handed variant of the game of Chopsticks with 2 players. Each player has a hand of n fingers, starting with i fingers up (i must be > 0). If we simulate the game for any n, we can test whether one player wins all games for i < n.
%C A302403 Prime numbers appear to be a subset of this sequence. a(n) is generally odd (but not always). Additionally, it appears that for all prime n, the game will always end in the same number of rounds, regardless of i.
%e A302403 Using the framework listed in the Comments section, let n = 5 and i = 1 (a standard game of 1-handed Chopsticks). Each player has 1 hand with 5 fingers and starts the game with 1 finger up. Player 1 goes first and taps Player 2's hand. Player 2 adds the number from Player 1's hand to their own, unless the amount exceeds 5 (the number of total fingers on the hand), in which case Player 2 subtracts 5 from the result. For example, on the first turn, Player 1 taps Player 2's hand, and Player 2 adds an additional finger (now 2 fingers up). Player 2 goes next, and play proceeds similarly. Player 2 taps their 2 fingers on Player 1's single finger, and Player 1 ends up with 3 fingers up. On the next turn, Player 1 taps their 3 fingers to Player 2's 2 fingers, and Player 2 now has 5 fingers up. The game ends when either player gets exactly 5 fingers up. In this case, Player 1 wins since Player 2 got to 5 fingers first. Clearly, this is a deterministic procedure, and Player 1 will always win when starting with 1 finger up on a hand of 5 fingers. It can be demonstrated that Player 1 will also win when starting with 2, 3, or 4 fingers (given the 5-finger hand). Hence, 5 is in the sequence.
%e A302403 Note that because i must be greater than 0 and i must be less than n, there are no valid values for i to take when n = 1.  Therefore, 1 should not be part of the sequence. - _Michael Schwalen_, Feb 08 2020
