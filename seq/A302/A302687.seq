%N A302687 a(1) = 1; a(2) = 2; then a(n) is the smallest number > a(n-1) such that a(n) divides concat(a(1), a(2), ..., a(n-1)).
%e A302687 a(3) = 3, which makes the concatenation of the first three terms: 123. After 3, the next-highest factor of 123 is 41, so a(4) = 41. The concatenation of the first four terms is then 12341. After 41, the next-highest factor of 12341 is 43, so a(5) = 43.

%Y A302687 Compare A240588, in which each term does not need to strictly increase as long as it has not yet appeared in the sequence.
%Y A302687 Compare also A171785, in which each term must divide the concatenation of all terms in the sequence including itself.
%Y A302687 In A029455, each term divides the concatenation of all smaller positive integers.
%Y A302687 In A110740, each term divides the concatenation of all strictly smaller positive integers.
