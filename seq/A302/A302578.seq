%e A302578 10 has a digitsum of 1; 10/1 has 0 as remainder; 0 is a substring of 10;
%e A302578 11 has a digitsum of 2; 11/2 has 1 as remainder; 1 is a substring of 11;
%e A302578 12 has a digitsum of 3; 12/3 has 0 as remainder; 0 is not a substring of 12, thus 12 is not in the sequence;
%e A302578 13 has a digitsum of 4; 13/4 has 1 as remainder; 1 is a substring of 13;
%e A302578 ...
%e A302578 2018 has a digitsum of 11; 2018 modulo 11 is 5; 5 is not a substring of 2018, thus 2018 is not in the sequence;
