%N A302555 Maximal degree x for hyperoperated representation of n = a[x]b.
%C A302555 Any nonnegative number can be decomposed in the following way: n = a[x]b, where the brackets denote the box notation of hyperoperation.
%C A302555 In this sequence we take the maximal value x where the above equation is satisfied for any nonnegative a and any nonnegative nonidentity element b.
%C A302555 If n can be circulated (n = a[+oo]b, with nonidentity element b) then a(n)=0. An identity element b is a number where we would have the trivial decomposition a[x]b = a, for some x for any a. If x=1 (addition) the identity element is b=0. If x > 1 (multiplication, exponentiation, tetration, pentation, etc.) the identity element is b=1. If n is prime, a(n)=1 because there's no x > 1 such that a[x]b = n and b > 1. If n is composite but not a nontrivial power then a(n)=2, because there would be no x > 2 such that a[x]b = n and b > 1. If n is a power but not a nontrivial hyper-4 power then a(n)=3, because there would be no x > 3 such that a[x]b = n and b > 1. If n is a hyper-4 power but not a nontrivial hyper-5 power then a(n)=3, because there would be no x > 4 such that a[x]b = n and b > 1. And so on.
