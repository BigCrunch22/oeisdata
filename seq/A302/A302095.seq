%N A302095 a(n) is the smallest positive integer not yet in the increasing sequence that is obtained when the largest digit from a(n-1) is deleted and the remaining digits are permuted such that no digit in a(n) has the same position it had in a(n-1) (counting from left to right). No repeated digits allowed; a(1)=10.
%C A302095 All terms in the sequence contain 0.
%C A302095 The fact that all digits in the terms are distinct makes the sequence finite.
%C A302095 In fact, the sequence contains 59 terms and a(59)=901325476.
%C A302095 The terms that require the smallest number of permutations to recover their natural ordering are a(1)=10, a(9)=1023 and a(35)=1023456 (one permutation required).

%e A302095 a(2)=230 since it is the smallest positive integer not yet in the sequence that is obtained when the largest digit 1 from a(1)=10 is deleted, the remaining digit 0 is permuted from the second to third place, and no digits are repeated.
