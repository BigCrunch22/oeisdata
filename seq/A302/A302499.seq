%N A302499 Lexicographically first sequence of distinct terms such that any set of four successive digits can be reordered as {d, d+1, d+2, d+3}, d being the smallest of the four digits.
%C A302499 As the digit 0 has no predecessor and the digit 9 has no successor here, sets of successive digits like {2,1,0,9} and {7,8,9,0} are forbidden.

%e A302499 Terms a(1) to a(10) are obvious;
%e A302499 a(11) is 67 because 67 is the smallest integer not yet in the sequence such that the elements of the sets {7,8,9,6} and {8,9,6,7} are four consecutive digits;
%e A302499 a(12) is 85 because 85 is the smallest integer not yet in the sequence such that the elements of the sets {9,6,7,8} and {6,7,8,5} are four consecutive digits;
%e A302499 a(13) is 674 because 674 is the smallest integer not yet in the sequence such that the elements of the three sets {7,8,5,6}, {8,5,6,7} and {5,6,7,4} are four consecutive digits;
%e A302499 etc.
