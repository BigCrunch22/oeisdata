%N A302202 a(n) = number of distinct words arising in Post's tag system {00, 1101} applied to the word (100)^n , or a(n) = -1 if this word has an unbounded trajectory.
%C A302202 a(n) = A284119(n) + A284121(n) (or -1 if the trajectory is unbounded).
%C A302202 a(n) is a lower bound on A284116(3n) (assuming that there is no starting string with an unbounded trajectory).
%C A302202 On October 30 2020, a student in my CS 360 class, Zhiping Cai, found that for n = 70051, 96938660265781 (96.9 trillion) steps are needed.  See https://github.com/zcai1/posts-problem .  I am not sure this has been independently verified. - _Jeffrey Shallit_, Sep 13 2021
