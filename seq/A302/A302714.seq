%N A302714 Decimal expansion of 2*sin(Pi/192).
%C A302714 This constant appears in a problem similar to the ones posed by Adriaan van Roomen (Adrianus Romanus) in his Ideae mathematicae from 1593. See the Havil reference, pp. 69-74, problem 2. See the comments on A302713 and A302711, also for the Romanus link. The present identity is  R(45, 2*sin(Pi/192)) = 2*sin(15*Pi/64) = A302713, with the monic Chebyshev polynomial R from A127672.
%C A302714 This number has been given in Vi√®te's 1595 reply (see A303982 for the link) to Romanus's problems in a corrected Exemplum secundum as solution to the polynomial value given there, which is, in trigonometric version, 2*sin(43*Pi/128) = A303982. Therefore his corrected value (the present one) is also incorrect because it is a solution to the polynomial value 2*sin(15*Pi/64). - _Wolfdieter Lang_, May 04 2018
