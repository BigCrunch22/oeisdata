%N A302921 Values of A000010(m) where gcd(A000010(m), m) equals the number of solutions of A000010(m) = A000010(x), and m is the least solution.
%F A302921 gcd(A000010(m), m) = #{A000010(m) = A000010(x)}.
%e A302921 20 is a term because 25 is the least solution of 20 = A000010(x) and gcd(20,25) equals the number of solutions 5.
%e A302921 7812 is a term because 9121 is the least solution of 7812 = A000010(x) and gcd(7813,9121) equals the number of solutions 7.
%e A302921 1764 is not a term because 2107 is the least solution of 1764 = A000010(x) and gcd(1764,2107) = 49 does not equal the number of solutions 7.
