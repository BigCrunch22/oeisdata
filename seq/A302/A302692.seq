%N A302692 Primes p that are the sum of another prime q and the greatest k such that k! < p.
%C A302692 Primes p such that p - A084558(p) is also a prime.
%C A302692 Inspired by the fact that this sequence has a nonempty intersection with A124598.
%C A302692 Let H be the intersection of this sequence and A124598. With some observed exceptions q = 3, 103, 1013, 1223, 2903, ..., if some p in this sequence is in H then the corresponding q also belongs to H. It is unknown whether H is finite.
%C A302692 Based upon the first terms of this sequence, it looks like those k satisfying the definition given in NAME are the even terms of A084558 repeated in certain weakly increasing sequence.

%e A302692 a(3) = 41 since 41 is the third prime that satisfies the given definition(s) for this sequence. Note that A084558(41) = 4; if we subtract: 41-4 = 37, which is also a prime. Also p = 41 and q = 37 are consecutive terms in A124598.
%e A302692 a(300) = 49459, because q = 49459 - A084558(49459) = 49451 is a prime and p = 49459 is the 300th prime satisfying such property. Also p and q are consecutive terms in A124598.
