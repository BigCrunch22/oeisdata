%N A341508 a(n) = 0 if n is nonabundant, otherwise a(n) is the number of abundant divisors of the last abundant number in the iteration x -> A003961(x) (starting from x=n) before a nonabundant number is reached.
%C A341508 Question: Is a(A336389(n)) = 1 for all n >= 2? Note that all the terms of A047802 are obviously primitively abundant (in A091191).

%e A341508 Starting from n = 120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5, the number of its abundant divisors is A080224(120) = 7. Then we apply a prime shift (A003961) to obtain the next number, 3^3 * 5 * 7 = 945, which has A080224(945) = 1 abundant divisors (as 945 is a term of A091191). The next prime shift gives 5^3 * 7* 11 = 9625, which has zero abundant divisors (as it is nonabundant, in A263837), so A080224(9625) = 0, and a(120) = 1, the last nonzero value encountered.
