%N A341654 Table read by antidiagonals upward: |T(n,k)| is the smallest number j such that j and j+1 have n and k divisors, respectively, or 0 if no such number exists, and the sign of T(n,k) is positive iff there exists only one such number j.
%C A341654 Absolute values of the nonzero terms here are the terms of A164119 (but the terms there are in ascending order).
%C A341654 The positive terms here are the terms of A161460 (although 50175 and 59049 there are conjectural).
%C A341654 The smallest number j such that j and j+1 have 11 and 12 divisors, respectively, is 59049, and (per the link at A161460) it isn't yet known whether that's the only such number. So T(11,12) is either 59049 or -59049.
%C A341654 T(n,k)=0 whenever both n and k are odd (since every number with an odd number of divisors is a square, and no two squares are consecutive integers).
%C A341654 Terms where both n and k are even (so neither j nor j+1 is a square) tend to be relatively small negative numbers. (T(2,2)=+2 is a special case; see Example section.)
%C A341654 Conjecture: T(n,k) < 0 for all T(n,k) where both n and k are even, other than the case n=k=2.
%e A341654 The only number j with 1 divisor is 1, so 1 is the only nonzero number in row n=1; its successor j+1 is 2 (a prime, so it has 2 divisors), so T(1,2)=1, and T(1,k)=0 for all k != 2.
%e A341654 The only two consecutive integers that are primes are 2 and 3, so 2 is the only number j such that both j and j+1 have 2 divisors, thus T(2,2)=2.
%e A341654 For j and j+1 to have 2 and 3 divisors, respectively, j must be a prime p, and j+1 must be the square of a prime q, and the only solution to p + 1 = q^2 is at p=3, so T(2,3)=3.
%e A341654 Numbers j such that j and j+1 have 2 and 4 divisors, respectively, begin 5, 7, 13, 37, 61, ...; since 5 is the smallest such number, T(2,4)=-5.
%e A341654 Every number with 11 divisors is of the form p^10 (p prime), and primes p such that p^10 + 1 has 8 divisors begin 11, 19, 101, 139, ..., so T(11,8) = -(11^10) = -25937424601.
