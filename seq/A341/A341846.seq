%N A341846 a(1) = 0; thereafter, if a(n) has not appeared before, a(n+1) = number of existing terms which are greater than a(n); otherwise, a(n) = n-m where a(m) is the most recent copy of a(n).
%C A341846 The sequence is nontrivial only with a(1) = 0 or 1. a(1)=0 here for contrast with the Van Eck sequence A181391, with which data agrees up to a(12). For n > 1, a(n)=0 if and only if a(n-1) is a record novel term, whereas every non-record novel term is followed by a term > 0. Definition implies a(n) < n for all n. Open questions: Is it true that a(n) + a(n+1) < n for all n? (This is true for n <= 65000.) Do records ever arise from rule 1? Does every number appear? (If so, 0 appears infinitely many times.)

%e A341846 a(2)=0 because a(1)=0 is a novel term, and there are 0 terms > 0.
%e A341846 a(3)=1 because a(2) has been seen before at a(1), and 2-1=1.
%e A341846 a(13)=1, because a(12)=5, a novel term with 1 earlier term (a(10)=6) greater than it.
