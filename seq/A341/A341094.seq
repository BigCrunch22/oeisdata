%N A341094 a(1) = 0. Thereafter, if a(n) has appeared before, most recently at a(m), then a(n+1) = n-m-1, the number of terms between a(m) and a(n). Otherwise a(n+1)=1.
%C A341094 Sequence is similar to A181391 except that the "count back" following a repeated term is 1 less, and the term following a first occurrence is 1 rather than 0. The plots are similar to those of the Van Eck sequence.

%e A341094 We start with a(1)=0, which has not appeared before, so a(2)=1, Likewise 1 has not appeared before so a(3) is also 1, which is a repeat term, last seen at a(2). Since there are no terms between the last two 1s, we have a(4)=0. We now have 0,1,1,0 and so a(5)=2, the number of terms between repetitions of zero. The only way a 0 appears in the sequence is as a consequence of adjacent identical terms k,k.
