%N A341058 Numbers that have only one divisor that is Brazilian.
%C A341058 m is a term iff m is a Brazilian prime (A085104), or m is the square of a Brazilian prime, or m = 121, the only square of prime that is Brazilian, or m = p*q >= 10 with p>q are non-Brazilian primes, or m is the cube of a Brazilian prime, or m = 12 or 18 (see corresponding examples).
%F A341058 A340795(a(n)) = 1.
%e A341058 One example for each type of terms that has k divisors:
%e A341058 -> k=2: 7 is a Brazilian prime, hence 7 = 111_2  is a term.
%e A341058 -> k=3: 169 has three divisors {1, 13, 169} and 13 = 111_3 is the only divisor of 169 that is Brazilian, hence 169 is a term.
%e A341058 -> k=3: 121 has three divisors {1, 11, 121} and 121 = 11111_3, hence, 121 that is the only square of prime that is Brazilian, is a term.
%e A341058 -> k=4: 34 has four divisors {1, 2, 17, 34} and 34 = 22_16  is the only divisor of 34 that is Brazilian, hence 34 is a term.
%e A341058 -> k=4: 27 has four divisors {1, 3, 9, 27} and 27 = 33_8 is the only divisor of 27 that is Brazilian, hence 27 is a term.
%e A341058 -> k=6: only two cases: 12 and 18, these integers have each 6 divisors and only 12 = 22_5 and 18 = 33_5 are Brazilian.
