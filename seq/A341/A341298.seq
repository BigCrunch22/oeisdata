%N A341298 Orders of complete groups.
%C A341298 A finite group G is called complete if Aut G = Inn G and Z(G) = {1} i.e. G has no outer automorphisms and the center of G is trivial.
%C A341298 The symmetric group S(n) of order n! is complete for n not equal to 2 or 6.
%C A341298 If p is an odd prime, there is a complete group of order p(p-1) and a complete group of order p^m*(p^m - p^(m-1)) for each m.
%C A341298 Dark in 1975 discovered a nontrivial complete group G of odd order. It has order 33209467522096377 = 3*19*17^12.
%C A341298 Recently, Dark showed that the smallest possible nontrivial complete group G of odd order has order 352947 = 3*7^6.

%e A341298 a(3) = 20 because 20 is the third number for which there is a complete group of that order.
