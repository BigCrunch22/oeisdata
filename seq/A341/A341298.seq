%N A341298 Orders of complete groups.
%C A341298 A finite group G is called complete if Aut G = Inn G and Z(G) = {1} i.e. G has no outer automorphisms and the center of G is trivial.
%C A341298 The symmetric group S(n) of order n! is complete for n not equal to 2 or 6.
%C A341298 If p is an odd prime, there is a complete group of order p(p-1) and a complete group of order p^m*(p^m - p^(m-1)) for each m.
%C A341298 Dark in 1975 discovered a nontrivial complete group G of odd order. It has order 788953370457 = 3*19*7^12. [Corrected by _Jianing Song_, Aug 25 2023]
%C A341298 Recently, Dark showed that the smallest possible nontrivial complete group G of odd order has order 352947 = 3*7^6. [In fact, for every prime p == 1 (mod 3), there exists a complete group of order 3*p^6, and it occurs as the automorphism group of a group of order 3*p^5. This means that there are infinitely many odd terms in this sequence. See the M. John Curran and Rex S. Dark link. - _Jianing Song_, Aug 25 2023]
%C A341298 From _Jianing Song_, Aug 25 2023: (Start)
%C A341298 The holomorph (see the Wikipedia link) of an abelian group of odd order is a complete group. See Theorem 3.2, Page 618 of the W. Peremans link.
%C A341298 No prime power (A246655) is a term. See the first Groupprops link.
%C A341298 The automorphism group of a complete group is isomorphic to itself. The converse is not true, as shown by the counterexamples D_8 and D_12. In contrast with the fact that the holomorph of a complete group is isomorphic to the external direct product of two copies of it (see the second Groupprops link), the holomorph of D_8 (SmallGroup(64,134)) is not isomorphic to D_8 X D_8 = SmallGroup(64,226), and the holomorph of D_12 (SmallGroup(144,154)) is not isomorphic to D_12 X D_12 = SmallGroup(144,192).
