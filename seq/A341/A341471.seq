%N A341471 Number of antisymmetric, antitransitive relations on n labeled nodes.
%C A341471 An antisymmetric, antitransitive relation is one where xRy implies "not yRx" and xRy and yRz implies "not xRz". All antitransitive relations are irreflexive, so this sequence is counting "anti-equivalence relations".
%C A341471 a(n) < A047656(n).
%C A341471 Idea thanks to Richard Arratia, who saw, verbatim in an editorial, "False equivalences? There were almost too many to count."

%e A341471 There are a(3) = 21 antisymmetric, antitransitive relations on n = 3 letters:
%e A341471   - the empty relation,
%e A341471   - all six relations containing only a single pair (x,y) (with x != y),
%e A341471   - all twelve relations {(x1,y1), (x2,y2)} containing exactly two ordered pairs, neither of which is (y1,x1) or (y2,x2), and
%e A341471   - two relations containing three ordered pairs: {(1,2), (2,3), (3,1)} and {(1,3), (3,2), (2,1)}.
%Y A341471 Number of relations on labeled nodes: A000110 (equivalence), A001831 (transitive and antitransitive), A002416 (unrestricted), A006125 (symmetric), A006905 (transitive), A047656 (reflexive and antisymmetric), A083667 (antisymmetric), A341473 (antitransitive).
