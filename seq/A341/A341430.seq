%e A341430 The decimal expansion of Catalan's constant = 0.9159655941772190150546... starts with 0 (see A006752) hence the first leader in the race of digits is 0, so a(1) = 0.
%e A341430 After five stages the new leader is 9 because the number 9 appears twice and the earlier leader appears once, so a(2) = 9.
%e A341430 After eight stages the new leader is 5 because the number 5 appears three times and the earlier leader appears twice, so a(3) = 5.
