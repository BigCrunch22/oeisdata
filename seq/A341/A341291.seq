%N A341291 a(n) = number of nodes of degree 3 or 4 that are at distance n from the origin in the graph of the Rick Kenyon tiling of the first quadrant by L and backwards-L tiles.
%C A341291 There is a unique way to tile the first quadrant with L-tiles and backward-L tiles. Upside down-L's are not allowed.
%C A341291 Consider the graph formed by the 1-skeleton of the tiling, with nodes at points of degree 3 or 4. The sequence gives the number of nodes at distance n from the node at the origin.
%C A341291 Proof that this tiling is unique, from Jaap Scherphuis, Feb 19 2021 (Start):
%C A341291 Build the tiling row by row, from bottom to top, left to right.
%C A341291 When you fill a row, you must keep the row above tileable. Since all the tiles have a length-2 base, any unfilled part of a row with no spaces underneath it is only tileable if it has even length.
%C A341291 When you place a tile, its stalk protrudes into the row above, and only one choice of the tile makes the unfilled part to the left of the stalk have even length. (End)
%C A341291 It appears that the number of vertical infinite "cuts" in the wall that start at height n is given by the Jacobsthal sequence A001045. - Maurizio Paolini, Feb 09 2021

%F A341291 Label a grid point with a 1 if it is the left end-point of the base of a normal L tile, with a 2 if it is the right end-point of the base of a backwards L-tile (which we could call an R tile), and with a 0 otherwise.
%F A341291 Then it appears that above the line x = 3y/2, (x,y) has label 1 if x=3m, y=2n; 2 if x=3m, y=2n+1; and 0 otherwise. It would be nice to have a formula for the points below the line. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 11 2021
