%N A341755 Maximum number of consecutive integers starting at n such that any pair (k, k+1) among these shares at least one digit with its sum k + (k+1) = 2k + 1.
%C A341755 Both members of the pair (k, k+1) must be in the considered set of consecutive integers, therefore a(n) = 0 when there is none, and a(n) >= 2 when there is at least one such pair. (So we consider the "length of a chain" to be the number of vertices, not edges.)
%C A341755 At powers of 10 (A011557) start "trivial" chains of increasingly large length.

%e A341755 a(0) = 2 because 0 + 1 = 1 shares a digit with (0,1).
%e A341755 a(1) = 0 because 1 + 2 = 3 shares no digit with (0,1).
%e A341755 a(9) = 5 because 9 + 10 = 19 shares '1' with (9, 10); 10 + 11 = 21 shares '1' with (10, 11); ..., 12 + 13 = 25 shares '2' with (12, 13), but 13 + 14 = 27 does not share any digit with (13, 14).
