%N A341578 a(n) is the minimum number of total votes needed for one party to win if there are n^2 voters divided into equal districts.
%C A341578 Comments from _Jack W Grahl_ and _Andrew Weimholt_, Feb 26 2021: (Start):
%C A341578 This is a two-party election. The size d of each district must divide n^2, so there are n^2/d equal districts.
%C A341578 The districts are winner-takes-all, and tied districts go to neither candidate. For an even number of districts, it is enough to win half the districts and tie in one further district.
%C A341578 So for 5 districts of 5 votes each, one party could win with 3 votes in each of 3 districts, and 0 in all other districts, for a total of a(5) = 9 votes.
%C A341578 For 8 districts of size 8, 5 votes in each of 4 districts and 4 votes in a fifth district are enough, for a total of a(8) = 24 votes.
%C A341578 d need not equal n. For n=6, it is better to gerrymander the 36 votes into 3 districts with 12 votes each, and then a(6) = 14 = 7+7+0 votes are enough to win. (End)
%C A341578 This is related to the gerrymandering question. What is the asymptotic behavior of a(n)? - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 20 2021. Answer from _Don Reble_, Feb 26 2020: The lower bound is [(n^2+1)/4 + n/2]; the upper bound is [n^2/4 + n]. Each bound is reached infinitely often. In general the best choice for d is not unique, since d and n/d give the same answer.

%F A341578 a(n) is the minimum value of {(floor(d/2)+1)*(floor(n^2/(2*d))+1) over all divisors d of n^2 AND (n/2+1)^2-1, if n is even}.
%e A341578 For a(2), divisors of 2^2 are 1, 2, 4:
%e A341578 d=1: (floor(1/2)+1)*(floor(2^2/(2*1))+1) = 1*3 = 3
%e A341578 d=3: (floor(2/2)+1)*(floor(2^2/(2*2))+1) = 2*2 = 4
%e A341578 d=9: (floor(4/2)+1)*(floor(2^2/(2*4))+1) = 3*1 = 3
%e A341578 OR
%e A341578 since n is even, ((2/2)+1)^2-1=3
%e A341578 Party A only needs 3 cells out of 4 to win a majority of districts.
%e A341578 For a(6), divisors of 6^2 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36:
%e A341578 By symmetry we can ignore d = 9, 12, 18 and 36;
%e A341578 d=1: (floor(1/2)+1)*(floor(6^2/(2*1))+1) = 1*19 = 19

%e A341578 d=4: (floor(4/2)+1)*(floor(6^2/(2*4))+1) = 3*5  = 15
%e A341578 d=6: (floor(6/2)+1)*(floor(6^2/(2*6))+1) = 4*4  = 16
%e A341578 OR
%e A341578 since n is even, ((6/2)+1)^2-1=15
%e A341578 Party A only needs 14 cells out of 36 to win a majority of districts.
