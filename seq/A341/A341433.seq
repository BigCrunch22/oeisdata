%N A341433 Numbers that are divisible by the product of their digits in primorial base representation.
%C A341433 The primorial base repunits (A143293) are all terms since their product of digits in primorial base is 1.
%C A341433 All the terms are zeroless in primorial base, and therefore they are terms of A328574. In particular, since the last digit of even numbers in primorial base is 0, all the terms are odd numbers.
