%N A341358 Deficient numbers k > 1 such that k*p is abundant for all primes p dividing k.
%C A341358 These numbers are quite close to being abundant.
%C A341358 Note that if k is a perfect number, then k*m is abundant for all m > 1. For deficient k we cannot expect this to happen since k*p must be deficient for all primes p that are large enough. However, it seems that the smallest p making k*p deficient is big compared with k. For example, the smallest prime p such that 315*p is deficient is p = 107, and the smallest prime p such that 884*p is deficient is p = 443.
%C A341358 It's actually possible that a multiple of a term (other than the term itself) is again in this sequence. However, it seems that this rarely happens. For example, both 1329548 and 1329548 * 16619 are terms.

%e A341358 The sum of divisors of 315 = 3^2 * 5 * 7 is 624 < 315 * 2, so 315 is deficient; however, all of 315 * 3, 315 * 5 and 315 * 7 are abundant, thus 315 is a term.
