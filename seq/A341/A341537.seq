%N A341537 a(n) is the number of digits from the end of the concatenation of all previous terms where n last appears. If n has not previously appeared then a(n) = n.

%e A341537 a(9) = 9 as the concatenation of all previous terms is "012345678" which does not include 9, so a(9) = 9.
%e A341537 a(12) = 13 as the concatenation of all previous terms is "01234567891011" which includes "12" as a substring, starting 13 digits from the end of the concatenation.
%e A341537 a(13) = 2 as the concatenation of all previous terms is "0123456789101113" which includes "13" as a substring, starting 2 digits from the end of the concatenation.
