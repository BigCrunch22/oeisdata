%N A341824 Number of groups of order 2^n which occur as Aut(G) for some finite group G.
%C A341824 The number of groups of order 2^n is A000679(n); the percentage of the 2-groups which occur as automorphism groups appears to decrease as n increases: 100, 100, 100, 60, 28.5, 17.6, 5.2, 1.4, ...
%C A341824 _Jianing Song_ remarks that it is also interesting to consider infinite groups, and asks if there is an infinite group G with Aut(G) isomorphic to C_8. _Des MacHale_, Mar 03 2021, replies that at present this is not known. [Comment edited by _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 07 2021]

%F A341824 a(n) <= A000679(n). - _Des MacHale_, Mar 02 2021
%e A341824 a(5) = 9 because there are nine groups of order 32 which occur as automorphism groups of finite groups.
%e A341824 From _Bernard Schott_, Feb 26 2021: (Start)
%e A341824 Aut(C_15) = Aut(C_16) = Aut(C_20) = Aut(C_30) ~~ C_4 x C_2 where ~~ stands for "isomorphic to".
%e A341824 Aut(C_4 x C_2) = Aut(D_4) ~~ D_4 where D_4 is the dihedral group of the square.
%e A341824 Aut(C_24) ~~ C_2 x C_2 x C_2 = (C_2)^3.
%e A341824 There exist five groups of order 8 (A054397), the three groups C_4 x C_2, D_4, C_2 x C_2 x C_2 occur as automorphim groups of order 8, but the cyclic group C_8 and the quaternions group Q_8 never occur as Aut(G) for some finite G, so a(3) = 3. (End)
