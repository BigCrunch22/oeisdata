%N A341993 a(0)=0. For n > 0, a(n+1) = 2*a(n) if the sum of digits of 2*a(n) exceeds that of a(n); otherwise, a(n+1) is the smallest unused nonnegative integer.
%C A341993 This sequence is a permutation of the nonnegative integers; the inverse permutation begins 0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 7, 6, 8, 4, 9, 10, ...
%C A341993 There exist areas that feature numbers in runs of three or more in arithmetic progression, such as (5, 7, 9) and (15, 16, 17, 18, 19).
%C A341993 Record values are 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 20, 40, 80, 88, ...

%e A341993 We start the sequence with 0. Doubling this integer results in 0, but as the sum of digits of 0 is equal to that of 0, we choose the smallest nonnegative integer not yet used, which is 1. We can double 1 three times before the sum of digits of 2*a(n) (i.e., 16) does not exceed that of a(n) (8). Thus the next term after 8 is the next unused nonnegative integer, 3, after which we resume doubling.
%Y A341993 Cf. A000079 (powers of 2), A331440 (similar principle, except lesser or equal sum of digits replaced by containing the digit S).
