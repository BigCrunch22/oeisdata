%N A341052 a(n) is the number of distinct ratios > 1 for which there exist A341051(n) n-digit integers (the maximum possible) that are in geometric progression.
%C A341052 The ratios are of the form m/(m-1) with m > 1.
%C A341052 The first few successive ratios are 2, 3/2, 3/2, 4/3, then a(5) = 2 because the two ratios 4/3 and 5/4 both give the largest possible number A341051(5) = 8 of 5-digit integers that are in geometric progression (see examples).
%C A341052 The numerators of corresponding ratios are in A341053.

%e A341052 There exist 6 integers in the largest possible string with 3-digit numbers that are in geometric progression (128, 192, 288, 432, 648, 972), and this string is obtained with the ratio = 3/2, so a(3) = 1.
%e A341052 From _Jinyuan Wang_, Apr 18 2021: (Start)
%e A341052 There exist 8 integers in the largest possible string with 5-digit numbers that are in geometric progression, and two such strings are obtained with these 2 distinct following ratios:
%e A341052 -> with ratio = 4/3, the 8 integers go from 10935 to 81920,
%e A341052 -> with ratio = 5/4, the 8 integers go from 16384 to 78125.
%e A341052 so a(5) = 2. (End)
