%N A341903 Lexicographically earliest sequence of nonnegative terms forming a clockwise square spiral when nothing else is read except the parity of the digits or the parity of the terms (see the Comments section).
%C A341903 An even term turns the pencil 0 degree to the right, then advances 1 unit; an odd term turns the pencil 90 degrees to the right, then advances 1 unit.
%C A341903 The same spiral is achieved when reading one by one the digits of the sequence (instead of the terms) and using the pencil accordingly.
%C A341903 This is possible as the terms of the sequence were carefully chosen to match the required parities term/digit of the two spirals.
%e A341903 The pencil points towards the East before the start. The 0 doesn't change its orientation and a 1-unit line directed towards the East is traced. As 1 is odd, the pencil turns 90 degrees towards the South and a 1-unit line is traced. As 3 is odd, the pencil turns 90 degrees towards the West and a 1-unit line is traced. As 2 is even, the pencil doesn't change its orientation (towards the West) and a 1-unit line is traced. As 5 is odd, the pencil turns 90 degrees towards the North and a 1-unit line is traced. As 4 is even, the pencil doesn't change its orientation (towards the North) and a 1-unit line is traced. Etc.
%e A341903 When it comes to a(11) = 20, the "digit-only-pencil" reads 2 (even), doesn't change its orientation and advances 1 square, then reads 0 (even), doesn't change its orientation and advances 1 square again.
%e A341903 Similarly, when it comes to a(11) = 20, the "term-only-pencil" reads 20 (even), doesn't change its orientation and advances 1 square. The same term-only-pencil will read later a(12) = 10 (even), won't change its orientation and will advance 1 square again. Those two steps in the same direction match the two steps in the same direction of the "digit-only-pencil). Etc.
%Y A341903 Cf. A344547 (uses only the "term-pencil"), A344548 (uses only the "digit-pencil"), A174344 (an example of a clockwise square spiral).
