%N A341859 Decimal expansion of 4 - (8/5)*sqrt(5).
%C A341859 In a triangle inscribed in a unit circle this is the maximal value of its inradius, such that a minimal closed Steiner chain of circles (10 circles) can be sandwiched between the incircle and circumcircle of the triangle.
%C A341859 It can be found as follows.
%C A341859 The squared distance between the centers of the two chain-defining circles is known to be d^2 = (R-r)^2 - 4*r*R*tan(Pi/n)^2.
%C A341859 On the other hand, the squared distance between the circumcenter and the incenter of triangle is known to be d^2 = R*(R-2*r).
%C A341859 Thus, in order to make a valid closed chain of circles, the inradius of triangle inscribed in the unit circle must be equal to 4*tan(Pi/n)^2.
%C A341859 Given that the maximum of such inradius is 0.5, the minimal number of chained circles is n=10, which gives the maximal value r = 4*tan(Pi/10)^2 = 0.42... < 0.5.
