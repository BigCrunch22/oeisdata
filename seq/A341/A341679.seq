%N A341679 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) = n divided by the most recently appearing divisor of n in all previous terms.
%C A341679 From _Michael De Vlieger_, Mar 03 2021: (Start)
%C A341679 Records are 1 and the primes, i.e., A008578.
%C A341679 1 is the minimum, with occasions of the term 2 local minima.
%C A341679 a(p)=p since a(1)=1, the empty product, is the only available divisor in a(n) for 1 <= n <= p for any prime p, since p itself does not yet appear in the sequence, and p is coprime to all smaller n, i.e., gcd(p, n) = 1 for all n < p. As a consequence of a(p) = p, a(1) = 1 is the only appearance of 1 in the sequence.
%C A341679 a(p^2) = p, and generally, a(p^k) = p^e, 1 <= e < k, 1 < a(c) < c for composite c.
%C A341679 Trajectories visible in the scatterplot of a(n) pertain to d = n/a(n) and have origin (d, 1) and slope 1/d. Noncomposite trajectories d appear more continuous than composite trajectories, which exhibit a quasi-regular, exponential pattern of interruptions.
%C A341679 The plot of n at (x,y) = (a(n), n/a(n)) "unfolds" the scatterplot of this sequence. (End)

%F A341679 a(n) = n if n is prime.
%e A341679 a(4) = 2 as a(2) = 2 is the most recently occurring divisor of 4, thus a(4) = 4/2 = 2.
%e A341679 a(5) = 5 as the only divisor of 5 in the sequence is 1, thus a(5) = 5/1 = 5.
%e A341679 a(10) = 2 as a(5) = 5 is the most recently occurring divisor of 10, thus a(10) = 10/5 = 2.
