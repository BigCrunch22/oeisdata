%N A341670 a(n) is conjecturally the largest prime p such that, for every prime q > p, q^n - 1 has more divisors than does p^n - 1, or -1 if no such prime p exists.
%C A341670 Conjecture: a(n) is also the largest prime p for which there exists no prime q > p such that p^n - 1 and q^n - 1 have the same number of divisors.
%e A341670 It is conjectured that there are infinitely many primes q such that q-1 has exactly A309906(1)=4 divisors (see also A005385), and p=5 is the largest prime p such that p-1 has fewer than 4 divisors, so a(1)=5.
%e A341670 Similarly, there appear to be infinitely many primes q such that q^2 - 1 has exactly A309906(2)=32 divisors (e.g., primes q such that, of the two factors q-1 and q+1 of q^2 - 1, one is twice a prime > 3 and the other is 12 times a prime > 3), and p=73 is the largest prime p such that p^2 - 1 has fewer than 32 divisors (see A341655), so a(2)=73.
%e A341670 a(4)=101 is the largest prime p such that p^4 - 1 has fewer than 160 divisors, and there are conjecturally infinitely many primes q such that q^4 - 1 has exactly A309906(4)=160 divisors.
%e A341670 a(29)=-1 because there are conjecturally infinitely many primes q such that q^29 - 1 has exactly A309906(29)=8 divisors, and there exists no prime p such that p^29 - 1 has fewer than 8 divisors.
