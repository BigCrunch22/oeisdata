%N A341012 The cumulative sum of the even digits so far in the sequence and the cumulative sum of the odd digits so far differ by n for all a(n)s.
%C A341012 This is the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct integers > 0 having this property.

%e A341012 Say that the current sequence is S, the cumulative sum at any moment of the even digits of S is E, the cumulative sum at any moment of the odd digits of S is O and the absolute difference |E-O| is D. We would then have:
%e A341012 S = 1, 10, 16, 7, 23, 32, 45, 54, 67, 76, 89, 98,...
%e A341012 E = 0   0   6  6   8  10  14  18  24  30  38  46
%e A341012 O = 1   2   3 10  13  16  21  26  33  40  49  58
%e A341012 D = 1   2   3  4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12 <-- this is = n.
%Y A341012 Cf. A071648, A071649.
%Y A341012 Cf. A341002 (numbers whose sum of even digits and sum of odd digits differ by 1).
