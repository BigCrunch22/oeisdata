%N A341721 a(n) = minimum number of total votes needed for one party to win if there are n voters divided into equal districts.
%C A341721 This is a two-party election. The size d of each district must divide n, so there are d' = n/d equal districts. The districts are winner-takes-all, and tied districts go to neither candidate. For an even number of districts, it is enough to win half the districts and tie in one further district.
%C A341721 In general the best choice for d is not unique, since d and n/d give the same answer.
%C A341721 This is related to the gerrymandering question.
%C A341721 See A341578 for further information.

%F A341721 a(n) is the minimum value over all ways of writing n = d*d' of:
%F A341721   (d+1)*(d'+1)/4 if d and d' are both odd;
%F A341721   (d+2)*(d'+1)/4 if d is even and d' is odd;
%F A341721   (d+1)*(d'+2)/4 if d is odd and d' is even;
%F A341721   (d+2)*(d'+2)/4-1 if d and d' are both even.
%F A341721 a(n) is bounded roughly between n/4 and n/2 (see graph). More precise bounds, which are attained infinitely often, are floor((n+1)/4 + sqrt(n)/2) <= a(n) <= floor((n/2)+1).
%e A341721 For n=25 voters the smallest number of votes needed to win is 9: gerrymander 5 districts of 5 voters each, with three votes for the party in each of three districts.
%e A341721 For n=36 voters the smallest number of votes needed to win is 14: gerrymander 3 districts of 12 voters each, with seven votes for the party in each of two districts.
%e A341721 For n=64 voters the smallest number of votes needed to win is 24: gerrymander 8 districts of 8 voters each, with five votes for the party in each of four districts and four votes in a fifth district.
