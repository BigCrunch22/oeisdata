%N A273884 Pick any pair of "6" digits in the sequence. Those two "6"s are separated by k digits. This is the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct terms in which all the resulting values of k are distinct.
%C A273884 The sequence starts with a(1)=0. It is then always extended with the smallest integer not yet present and not leading to a contradiction (which would mean producing a value of k already seen).
