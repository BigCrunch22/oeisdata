%N A273865 The successive numbers of integers visible between two odd terms are given by the sequence itself.
%C A273865 The sequence starts with a(1)=0. It is then extended with the smallest integer not yet present and not leading to a contradiction. The sequence is a permutation of the integers >=0.
%e A273865 The first two odd terms that appear in the sequence are 1 and 3; between 1 and 3 there are 0 integers and this 0 corresponds to the starting 0 of the sequence.
%e A273865 The next odd term is 5 and between 3 and 5 there is 1 integer [which is 2] and this 1 corresponds to the next term of the sequence.
%e A273865 The next odd term is 7 and between 5 and 7 there are 3 integers [which are 4, 6 and 8] and this 3 corresponds to the next term of the sequence.
%e A273865 The next odd term is 9 and between 7 and 9 there are 2 integers [which are 10 and 12] and this 2 corresponds to the next term of the sequence.
%e A273865 The next odd term is 11 and between 9 and 11 there are 5 integers [which are 14, 16, 18, 20 and 22] and this 5 corresponds to the next term of the sequence. Etc.
