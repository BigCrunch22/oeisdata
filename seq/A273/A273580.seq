%N A273580 Decimal expansion of the infinite nested radical sqrt(F_0 + sqrt(F_1 + sqrt(F_3 + ...))), where F_k are the Fermat numbers A000215.
%C A273580 The convergence of this expression follows from Vijayaraghavan's theorem, for which it represents an extreme example.
%C A273580 Two PARI programs to compute this constant are listed below. The first one is a brute-force implementation of the definition and allows the computation of only 13 digits before exceeding current PARI capabilities. The second one implements the following 'trick' inspired by a comment in A094885: Let us try to compute first x = a/sqrt(2). We have x = (1/sqrt(2))sqrt(3+ sqrt(5+ sqrt(17+ ... ))) = sqrt(3/2+ (1/2)sqrt(5+ sqrt(17+ ... ))) = sqrt(3/2+ sqrt(5/4+ (1/4)sqrt(17+ ... ))) = sqrt(3/2+ sqrt(5/4+ sqrt(17/16+ ... ))) = sqrt(c_0+sqrt(c_1+sqrt(c_3+...))), where c_n = (2^(2^n)+1)/2^(2^n) = 1+d_n, with d_n = 2^(-2^n). This nested radical is easy to manage to any precision. However, evaluating it up to N terms, its convergence with increasing N is no better than that of the original algorithm. To speed it up, one must notice that, since the c_n converge rapidly to 1, and since the nested radical sqrt(1+sqrt(1+...)) evaluates to the golden ratio phi (A001622), the latter is the natural best stand-in for the neglected part (terms from N+1 to infinity). With this modification, i.e., 'seeding' the iterations with phi instead of 0, the convergence becomes extremely fast (the number of valid digits more than doubles upon incrementing N by 1).
