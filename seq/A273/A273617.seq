%N A273617 Divide a(n) by the last digit of a(n-1); the remainder is the first digit of a(n+1). The sequence is started with a(1)=2 and always extended with the smallest integer not yet present in the sequence and not leading to a contradiction.
%C A273617 No term can end with the digits 0 or 1 as those would produce a division by 0. This means that no term a(n) in the sequence is divisible by the last digit of a(n-1)
