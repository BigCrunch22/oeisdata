%N A273235 Number of Ramanujan's largely composite numbers having prime(n) as the greatest prime divisor.
%C A273235 Theorem. The sequence is unbounded.
%C A273235 Proof. Since the sequence of highly composite numbers (A002182) is a subsequence of this sequence, it is sufficient to prove that the number M_n of highly composite numbers with the maximal prime divisor p_n is unbounded. Let N be a large highly composite number. Then for the greatest prime divisor p_N of N we have [Erdos] p_N=O(log N). So for all N<=x, p_N=O(log x).
%C A273235 If M_n=O(1), then the number of all highly composite numbers <=x is O(p_n)=O(log x). However, Erdos [Erdos] proved that this number is more than (log x)^(1+c) for a certain c>0.
%C A273235 So we have a contradiction. This means that M_n and this sequence are unbound. QED
