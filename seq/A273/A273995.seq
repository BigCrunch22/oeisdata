%N A273995 Even numbers with a unique representation as the difference of two primes, each of which is a member of a pair of twin primes, and one of which is smaller than the even number under consideration.
%C A273995 For the sequence to be infinite there must be an infinite number of twin prime pairs.
%C A273995 Can any even number n > 2 be so written (perhaps not uniquely) as the difference of two (unrelated) twins, one of which is smaller than n?  (T. S. Van Kortryk conjectures there are, if any, only a finite number of even integers such that this is not true.)
%e A273995 For even n with 4 <= n <= 100, all have at least one representation as the difference of two primes, each of which is a member of a pair of twin primes, but the following have only one such representation, and so belong to the sequence:

%e A273995      6 =  11 -  5
%e A273995     20 =  31 - 11
%e A273995     34 =  41 -  7
