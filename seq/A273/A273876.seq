%N A273876 The successive numbers of digits visible between two odd terms are given by the sequence itself.
%C A273876 The sequence starts with a(1)=0. It is then extended with the smallest integer not yet present and not leading to a contradiction. This sequence is a permutation of the integers >=0.
%e A273876 The first two odd terms that appear in the sequence are 1 and 3; between 1 and 3 there are 0 digits and this 0 corresponds to the starting 0 of the sequence.
%e A273876 The next odd term is 5; between 3 and 5 there is 1 digit [which is 2] and this 1 corresponds to the second term of the sequence.
%e A273876 The next odd term is 7; between 5 and 7 there are 3 digits [which are 4, 6 and 8] and this 3 corresponds to the third term of the sequence.
%e A273876 The next odd term is 9; between 7 and 9 there are 2 digits [which are 1 and 0] and this 2 corresponds to the fourth term of the sequence.
%e A273876 The next odd term is 11; between 9 and 11 there are 5 digits [which are 1, 2, 1, 0 and 0] and this 5 corresponds to the fifth term of the sequence. Etc.
