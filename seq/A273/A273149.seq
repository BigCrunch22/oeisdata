%N A273149 a(n) = A053839(n)+1.
%C A273149 A four-way fair share sequence.  This is similar to the Thue-Morse Sequence. The Thue-Morse Sequence is the fairest way to split objects amongst two groups. If we call the groups A and B, most people split ABABABABABABABABABABABAB.......
%C A273149 This is unfair for B, because out of the best 2, A gets the best. Out of the second best 2, a gets the best. The Thue-Morse Sequence solves this:
%C A273149 ABBABAABBAABABBABAABABBAABBABAAB... The easiest way to generate the Thue-Morse Sequence is starting with a 1. Every 1 becomes 12. Every 2 becomes 21. Thus the sequence is obtained by recursion.
%C A273149 The present sequence is the same, but for splitting objects amongst 4 groups. Start with a 1. Every 1 becomes 1,2,3,4. Every 2 becomes 2,3,4,1. Every 3 becomes 3,4,1,2. Every 4 becomes 4,1,2,3.
%Y A273149 Cf. A010060, A053839.
