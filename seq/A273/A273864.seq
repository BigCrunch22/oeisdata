%N A273864 The successive numbers of digits visible between two even terms are given by the sequence itself.
%C A273864  The sequence starts with a(1)=0. It is then extended with the smallest integer not yet present and not leading to a contradiction.
%e A273864 The first two even terms that appear in the sequence are 0 and 2; between 0 and 2 there are 0 digits and this 0 corresponds to the starting 0 of the sequence.
%e A273864 The next even term is 4 and between 2 and 4 there are 2 digits [which are 1 and 3] and this 2 corresponds to the next term of the sequence.
%e A273864 The next even term is 6 and between 4 and 6 there is 1 digit [which is 5] and this 1 corresponds to the next term of the sequence.
%e A273864 The next even term is 8 and between 6 and 8 there are 3 digits [which are 7, 1 and 1] and this 3 corresponds to the next term of the sequence.
%e A273864 The next even term is 10 and between 8 and 10 there are 4 digits [which are 9, 1, 0 and 1] and this 4 corresponds to the next term of the sequence.
