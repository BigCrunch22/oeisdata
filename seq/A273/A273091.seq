%N A273091 Successive integers produced by Conway's PRIMEGAME, starting with 6 rather than 2.
%C A273091 Upon reaching 225, this sequence becomes the same as A007542, having skipped over 4 (which corresponds to the prime 2) and then goes on to 8 (which corresponds to the prime 3).
%e A273091 Multiply 6 by 15/2 to obtain 45. Then for 45, multiplying by the first thirteen fractions fails to produce an integer, so 45 * 55 = 2475.
