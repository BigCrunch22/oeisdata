%N A273461 Number of physically stable n X n placements of water source-blocks in Minecraft.
%C A273461 In Minecraft worlds, a source block of water can be reacted with another source block, two blocks away. This reaction creates a third "infinite" source block in the unoccupied intermediate block, so called because if the intermediate water source is destroyed or picked up by a player using a bucket, it will immediately regenerate itself.
%C A273461 A placement of water at several positions in an n X n board is said to be *stable* if no infinite water physics can in fact occur (under otherwise optimal conditions). This means that the total quantity of water in the system is held constant.
%C A273461 In short, no two source blocks can be graph-distance 2 from each other. - _Gus Wiseman_, Nov 27 2019
%C A273461 Often incorrectly described as cellular automata, the observed behaviors of liquids within a board are inseparable in certain ways from states of affair outside of the board and events outside of the system. This aspect of Minecraft is poorly understood.
