%N A273479 The successive numbers of digits between two "0"s in the sequence are given by the sequence itself.
%C A273479 This is the lexicographically first such sequence, starting with a(1)=1; it was always extended with the smallest integer not already present in the sequence and not leading to a contradiction.
%e A273479 There is 1 digit between the first two "0" of the sequence [1,0,100]; then there are 0 digits between the next pair of "0": [100]; then there are 100 digits between the next pair of "0": [100,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,110]; then there are 2 digits between the next pair of "0": [110,120], etc. The quantities 1, 0, 100, 2,... rebuild the starting sequence. The next "gaps" will thus be of 3 digits, then 4, then 5...
