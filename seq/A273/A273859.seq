%N A273859 The successive numbers of integers visible between two primes are given by the sequence itself.
%C A273859 The sequence starts with a(1)=0. It is then extended with the smallest integer not yet present and not leading to a contradiction. This sequence is a permutation of the integers >=0
%e A273859 The first two primes that appear in the sequence are 2 and 3; between 2 and 3 there are 0 integers and this 0 corresponds to the starting 0 of the sequence.
%e A273859 The next prime is 5 and between 3 and 5 there is 1 integer [which is 4] and this 1 corresponds to the next term of the sequence.
%e A273859 The next prime is 7 and between 5 and 7 there are 2 integers [which are 6 and 8] and this 2 corresponds to the next term of the sequence.
%e A273859 The next prime is 11 and between 7 and 11 there are 3 integers [which are 9, 10 and 12] and this 3 corresponds to the next term of the sequence.
%e A273859 The next prime is 13 and between 11 and 13 there are 4 integers [which are 14, 15, 16 and 18] and this 4 corresponds to the next term of the sequence.
