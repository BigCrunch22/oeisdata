%N A273381 2..a(n) is the smallest range in which the most common value of Omega(k) is n, where Omega(k) is the number of prime factors of k (A001222).
%e A273381 Among the numbers from 2 to a(2)=26 the most common value of Omega is 2. Indeed, there are 9 numbers for which Omega is 1 (the primes) and 10 for which Omega is 2 (the semiprimes).
