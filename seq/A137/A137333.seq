%N A137333 Spiral tiling numbers.
%C A137333 This is basically three intertwined sequences:
%C A137333 triangular: 3*1, 3*4, 3*16, ... 3*4^n;
%C A137333 square: 4*1, 4*9, 4*81, ... 4*9^n;
%C A137333 hexagonal: 6*1, 6*7, 6*49, ... 6*7^n.
%C A137333 Each number in the above sequence has a particular geometric interpretation:
%C A137333   3: a single triangular tile
%C A137333   4: a single square tile
%C A137333   6: a single hexagonal tile
%C A137333 12 = 3*4 = triangle (three sides) * 4 tiles = one triangle in the center, with 3 equally sized triangles surrounding it;
%C A137333 36 = 4*9 = square (four sides) * 9 tiles = one square with 8 other similar copies surrounding it;
%C A137333 42 = 6*7 = hexagon (six sides) * 7 tiles = one hexagon with 6 other copies surrounding it.
%C A137333 Each number in the sequence has a prime factorization which uniquely determines whether it corresponds to a triangular, square or hexagonal tiling and the tiling's size. Factorization and rewriting into canonical form effectively becomes the inverse operation of "mixing" the three initial sequences.
