%F A137923 Members of the sequence are numbers n = X(1)...X(r) for which digits the following equation holds: (X(1) + ... + X(r)) + (X(1)*X(2) + ... + X(r-1)*X(r)) + ... + (X(1)*...*X(r)) = p, where p is a prime number, X(i) is the i-th digit of n, and every digit is nonzero.
%e A137923 2-digit numbers are of the form X(1)X(2).
%e A137923 The equation is then X(1) + X(2) + X(1)*X(2) = p, where p is prime and both digits are nonzero. Power set is {();(1);(2);(1,2)}, so indices of digits in the equation are running through the power set.
%e A137923 Following numbers n are solutions of the equation:
%e A137923 11 because 1 + 1 + 1*1 = 3;
%e A137923 12 (and its reverse, 21) because 1 + 2 + 1*2 = 5;
%e A137923 13 (and its reverse, 31) because 1 + 3 + 1*3 = 7;
%e A137923 15 (and its reverse, 51) because 1 + 5 + 1*5 = 11;
%e A137923 16 (and its reverse, 61) because 1 + 6 + 1*6 = 13;
%e A137923 18 (and its reverse, 81) because 1 + 8 + 1*8 = 17;
%e A137923 19 (and its reverse, 91) because 1 + 9 + 1*9 = 19;
%e A137923 23 (and its reverse, 32) because 2 + 3 + 2*3 = 11;
%e A137923 25 (and its reverse, 52) because 2 + 5 + 2*5 = 17;
