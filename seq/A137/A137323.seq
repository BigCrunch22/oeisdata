%C A137323 Previous name was: Characteristic value of numbers used to compute number of binary expansions of a certain length that have a given number of rotational symmetries.
%C A137323 Sequence is useful in counting binary expansions of length l with r rotational symmetries (we only consider r>1), where r has to be a proper divisor not equal to 1.
%C A137323 We discount numbers with l symmetry, because we know this only occurs once, at (2^l) - 1.
%C A137323 For example, consider binary expansions of length 8. We know that for any number the possible symmetries are the proper divisors of 8 not equal to 1; (2, 4).
%C A137323 So if we would like to find the number of expansions of length 8 that have 2 rotational symmetries, it is [2^(8/2 -1) -1] - a(8/2) = 7 - 1 = 6.
%C A137323 In general it appears that the formula for r rotational-symmetric numbers of expansion length l is the following: [2^(l/r -1) -1] - a(l/r).

%F A137323 a(n) = sum(d divides n,  2^(n/d-1) - 1 ), omitting d=1 and d=n.
%e A137323 a(6) = 4 because 6 has (2,3) as proper divisors not equal to one. Plugging these values into the formula we get [2^(6/2 -1)-1] + [2^(6/3 -1) -1] = 3 + 1 = 4.
%e A137323 For p prime, a(p) = 0.
%t A137323 a[1] = 0; a[n_] := Sum[2^(n/d - 1) - 1, {d, Divisors[n][[2 ;; -2]]}];
