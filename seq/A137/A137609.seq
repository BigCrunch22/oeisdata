%N A137609 Consider a line in n-space given parametrically by y(t)=v*t, where v is the vector (2,3,5,..prime(n)). Let t0>0 be the least value of t such that y(t0) is closest to an integer point not on the line y(t). a(n) is t0 times v.v.
%C A137609 See A059804 for the distance from y(t0) to the integer point. Observe that for n >= 19, a(n) = prime(n). For n >= 19, the closest integer point is (0,0,0,..,0,1).
