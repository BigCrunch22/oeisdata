%C A137453 Playing around with different starting pairs, it looks like all starting pairs either end in a loop, or by going to the pair (0,0) which is either a loop or a singularity, depending on whether you take 0 mod 0 as being 0 or undefined. Furthermore, you can go an arbitrarily long time without looping. Take for large a: .., 6*a+6, 6*a, ... The next term is 6*a-6, and progressively it goes down the ladder by steps of 6 until it terminates at ..., 18, 12, 6, 0, 0. In a few minutes of searching, the longest sequence I could find which eventually loops without going to zero was the sequence starting with (29,574), which hits 855 at the 79th term and then stays at 855. - Jack Brennan
