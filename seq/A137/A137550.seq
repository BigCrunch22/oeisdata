%N A137550 Number of permutations in S_n avoiding 31{bar 5}{bar 4}2 (i.e., every occurrence of 312 is contained in an occurrence of a 31542).

%C A137550 A permutation p avoids a pattern q if it has no subsequence that is order-isomorphic to q. For example, p avoids the pattern 132 if it has no subsequence abc with a < c < b.
%C A137550 Barred pattern avoidance considers permutations that avoid a pattern except in a special case. Given a barred pattern q, we may form two patterns, q1 = the sequence of unbarred letters of q and q2 = the sequence of all letters of q.
%C A137550 A permutation p avoids barred pattern q if every instance of q1 in p is embedded in a copy of q2 in p. In other words, p avoids q1, except in the special case that a copy of q1 is a subsequence of a copy of q2.
%C A137550 For example, if q = 5{bar 1}32{bar 4}, then q1 = 532 and q2 = 51324. p avoids q if every for decreasing subsequence acd of length 3 in p, one can find letters b and e so that the subsequence abcde of p has b < d < c < e < a. (End)
%C A137550 Comment from _David Callan_, Oct 14 2012: (Start)
%C A137550 a(n) appears to be the number of integer sequences u = (u(0),u(1),...,u(n-1)) satisfying (i) 0<=u(i)<=i for all i, (ii) either u(i)<u(i+1) or u(i+1)=0 for all i, (iii) whenever nonzero entries a,b (in that order) are separated in u by precisely k>=1 0's, b-k does not lie in the interval [1,a].
%C A137550 To illustrate, 020 violates condition (i), 011 violates condition (ii), and 0102 violates condition (iii).
%C A137550 When n=3 the 5 "u" sequences are 000, 001, 002, 010, 012, and when n=4 the 14 "u" sequences are 0000, 0001, 0002, 0003, 0010, 0012, 0013, 0020, 0023, 0100, 0101, 0103, 0120, 0123.
%C A137550 The sequences satisfying the first two conditions are counted by the Bell numbers A000110. (End)
