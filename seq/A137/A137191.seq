%N A137191 Number of n-celled polyiamonds with perimeter < n+2.
%C A137191 These are n-cell polyiamonds with the perimeter less than the maximum possible one.
%C A137191 If we associate a graph to a polyiamond with vertices representing cells and edges representing two cells with a common edge, then this sequence enumerates polyiamonds whose corresponding graphs have cycles.
