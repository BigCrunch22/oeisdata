%C A137937 To have 0 upon vertical 2, 10, 18, 36, 54, 86 (noble gases) is not a problem (with the help of A137583. A (second) 0 upon 1, 3, 11, 19, 37, 55, 87 (alkali metals), seems paradoxal. Is 120 terms (elements) sequence 0, 0, 1, 2, .. 117, 118 credible? This leads to a row 0 (0 upon hydrogen, 0 upon helium). Two common points with Janet periodic table elements.
