%N A137939 Number of 5-way intersections in the interior of a regular 6n-gon.
%C A137939 When n is odd, there are no intersections in the interior of an n-gon where more than 2 diagonals meet.
%C A137939 When n is not a multiple of 6, there are no intersections in the interior of an n-gon where more than 3 diagonals meet except the center.
%C A137939 When n is not a multiple of 30, there are no intersections in the interior of an n-gon where more than 5 diagonals meet except the center.
%C A137939 I checked the following conjecture up to n=210: "An n-gon with n=30k has 5n points where 6 or 7 diagonals meet and no interior point other than the center where more than 7 diagonals meet; If k is odd, then 6 diagonals meet in each of 4n points and 7 diagonals meet in each of n points; If k is even, then no groups of exactly 6 diagonals meet in a point, while exactly 7 diagonals meet in each of 5n points (all points interior excluding the center)."

%F A137939 a(n) = A101365(6*n). - _Seiichi Manyama_, Jul 20 2024
%e A137939 a(3) = 54 because there are 54 points in the interior of an 18-gon at which exactly five diagonals meet.
