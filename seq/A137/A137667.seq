%N A137667 The sequence alternates even and odd integers but also even and odd digits; it is monotonically increasing and a(n) is always the smallest integer fitting the pattern.
%e A137667 The integer after "9" must be even, must start with an even digit and must be the smallest one larger than "9"; only "210" satisfies all requirements. The integer after "210" must be odd, must start with an odd digit and must be the smallest one larger than "210"; only "301" fits, etc.
