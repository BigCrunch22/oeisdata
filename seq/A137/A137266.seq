%N A137266 a(n) = number of positive integers k where k divides (n - floor(n/k)).
%e A137266 For n = 8, checking: 1 divides (8 - floor(8/1))=0. 2 divides (8 - floor(8/2))=4. 3 divides (8 - floor(8/3))=6. 4 doesn't divide (8 - floor(8/4))=6. 5 doesn't divide (8 - floor(8/5))=7. 6 doesn't divide (8 - floor(8/6))=7. 7 divides (8 - floor(8/7))=7. 8 doesn't divide (8 - floor(8/8))=7. For k > 8, k doesn't divide (n - floor(n/k)) = n. There are 4 cases where k does divide (n-floor(n/k)); so a(8) = 4.
