%N A137202 Number of nodes in the BDD for the hidden weighted bit function h_n under the best possible ordering of variables.
%C A137202 In this problem we don't consider "complement bits" to shorten the BDD.
%C A137202 The best method presently known to find a(n) takes something like 2.5^n steps.

%e A137202 For example, when n=8 the smallest BDD is obtained when one tests first x8 (1 node), then x7 (2 nodes), then x1 (4), then x6 (6), then x2 (9), then x5 (12), then x4 (8), then x3 (2). The total number of nodes is 46, including the two sink nodes.
