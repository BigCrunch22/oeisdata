%N A137417 Limiting sequence when we start with positive integers (A000027) and at step n >= 1 add to the term at position n + a(n) the value a(n).
%C A137417 At the vast majority of positions the term is changed at most once, but at some positions a change occurs twice. An example is position 20. In step 4 the term at position 4 + a(4) = 8 is changed to 8 + a(4) = 12; in step 8 the term at position 8 + a(8) = 20 is changed to 20 + a(8) = 32; in step 10 the term at position 10 + a(10) = 20 is changed to a(20) + a(10) = 32 + 10 = 42.
%C A137417 The first position where the term is changed three times is 3498. [_Klaus Brockhaus_, Apr 23 2008]
%C A137417 The first position where the term is changed four times is 1024914. [_Rémy Sigrist_, Mar 11 2017]
