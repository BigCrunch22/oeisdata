%N A137171 Interleaved reading of A000749 and its first to third differences.
%C A137171 A000749 is identical to its fourth differences, which implies that the 2nd differences equal the 5th, the 3rd differences the 6th and so on and implies that each of the sequences of these differences obeys the recurrence a(n)=4a(n-1)-6a(n-2)+4a(n-3), n > 3.
%C A137171 The table containing A000749 and its first differences (essentially A038505), 2nd differences (A038504) and 3rd differences (A038503) as the 4 rows is
