%N A137264 Prime number gaps read modulo 3.
%C A137264 Conjecture: The only digit that is repeated in the sequence is 0 except for n=2 and n=3 where 2 repeats. So 1 may be followed by 2 or 0; 2 may be followed by 1 or 0; 0 may be followed by 0 or 1 or 2. this has been confirmed for the first million prime gaps.
%C A137264 The conjecture is true, because any three numbers whose differences are (1, 1) or (2, 2) will form a complete residue system modulo 3, and hence one of them will be a multiple of 3. - _Karl W. Heuer_, Mar 16 2016
