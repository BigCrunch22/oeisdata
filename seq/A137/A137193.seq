%N A137193 Number of n-celled polyhexes with perimeter < 4n+2.
%C A137193 These are n-cell polyhexes with the perimeter less than the maximum possible one.
%C A137193 If we associate a graph to a polyhex with vertices representing cells and edges representing two cells with a common edge, then this sequence enumerates polyhexes whose corresponding graphs have cycles.
