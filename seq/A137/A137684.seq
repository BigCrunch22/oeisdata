%N A137684 Number of tieless (American) football games with n scoring events.
%C A137684 A game is a sequence of valid scores (positive values for the home team, negative values for the visiting team). Note that then the set of valid scores for football is {2,3,6,7,8,-2,-3,-6,-7,-8}. A tieless game is one in which the teams are never in a tie (except at the beginning, when no team has scored yet).

%e A137684 a(2)=90, because there are 10^2=100 sequences of length 2 on the alphabet {2,3,6,7,8,-2,-3,-6,-7,-8}; the 10 sequences that correspond to games with ties are precisely those of the form {k,-k}.
%Y A137684 Cf. A135490 (basketball).
