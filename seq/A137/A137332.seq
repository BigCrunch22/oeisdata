%N A137332 Primes which are equal to the order of 2 modulo a prime q, sorted with respect to the value of q.
%C A137332 This is a multipermutation of the primes A000040 with every prime p appearing exactly A001221(2^p-1) times. - _Max Alekseyev_, May 01 2008
%H A137332 Amiram Eldar, <a href="/A137332/b137332.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..10000</a> (terms 1..106 from Joerg Arndt)
%F A137332 a(n) = A007733(A122094(n)) = A002326((A122094(n)-1)/2). - _Max Alekseyev_, May 01 2008
%e A137332 The k-th term of the sequence is ord(2 mod A122094(k)).
%e A137332 For example, 223 is the 9th term of A122094 and ord(2 mod 223)=37, so 37 is the 9th term of this sequence.
%e A137332 11 is both the third term because ord(2 mod 23) == 11 and the sixth term because ord(2 mod 89) == 11.
%e A137332 Note both 23 and 89 divide 2^11-1; the third and sixth terms of A122094 are 23 and 89.
