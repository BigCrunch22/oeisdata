%N A137540 Number of permutations in S_n avoiding {bar 4}1253 (i.e., every occurrence of 1253 is contained in an occurrence of a 41253).
%C A137540 From _Lara Pudwell_, Oct 23 2008: (Start)
%C A137540 A permutation p avoids a pattern q if it has no subsequence that is order-isomorphic to q. For example, p avoids the pattern 132 if it has no subsequence abc with a < c < b.
%C A137540 Barred pattern avoidance considers permutations that avoid a pattern except in a special case. Given a barred pattern q, we may form two patterns, q1 = the sequence of unbarred letters of q and q2 = the sequence of all letters of q.
%C A137540 A permutation p avoids barred pattern q if every instance of q1 in p is embedded in a copy of q2 in p. In other words, p avoids q1, except in the special case that a copy of q1 is a subsequence of a copy of q2.
%C A137540 For example, if q = 5{bar 1}32{bar 4}, then q1 = 532 and q2 = 51324. p avoids q if every for decreasing subsequence acd of length 3 in p, one can find letters b and e so that the subsequence abcde of p has b < d < c < e < a. (End)
