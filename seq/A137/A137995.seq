%S A137995 7,159,270,308,745,758,1080,1227,7805
%N A137995 Nearest integer to 1/frac(Pi^A137994(n)), where frac(x) = x - floor(x).
%C A137995 Sequence A137994 could be defined as "least positive integer such that this one (without rounding) is increasing".
%C A137995 The term a(1)=7 is not surprising (3 + 1/7 = 3.14...) but it comes as a funny surprise that the next term, a(2)=159, matches the next 3 digits of Pi and a(3) just differs by 5 from the next 3 digits!
