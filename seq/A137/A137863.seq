%N A137863 Orders of simple groups which are non-cyclic and non-alternating.
%C A137863 From _Bernard Schott_, Apr 26 2020: (Start)
%C A137863 About a(16) = 20160; 20160 = 8!/2 is the order of the alternating simple group A_8 that is isomorphic to the Lie group PSL_4(2), but, 20160 is also the order of the Lie group PSL_3(4) that is not isomorphic to A_8.
%C A137863 Indeed, 20160 is the smallest order for which there exist two nonisomorphic simple groups and it is the order of this group PSL_3(4) that was missing in the data. The first proof that there exist two nonisomorphic simple groups of this order was given by the American mathematician Ida May Schottenfels (1900) [see the link]. (End)

%e A137863 Two particular examples:
%e A137863 a(1) = 168 is the order of the smallest non-cyclic and non-alternating simple group, this Lie group is the projective special linear group PSL_2(7) that is isomorphic to the general linear group GL_3(2).
%e A137863 a(12) = 7920 is the order of the smallest sporadic group (A001228), the Mathieu group M_11. (End)
