%N A137841 Number of distinct n-ary operators in a quinternary logic.
%C A137841 The total number of n-ary operators in a k-valued logic is T = k^(k^n), i.e. if S is a set of k elements, there are T ways of mapping an ordered subset of n elements taken from S to an element of S. Some operators are "degenerate": the operator has arity p, if only p of the n input values influence the output. = therefore the set of operators can be partitioned into n+1 disjoint subsets representing arities from 0 to n.
%F A137841 a(n) = 5^(5^n).
%Y A137841 Cf. A001146 (in binary logic), A055777 (in ternary logic), A137840 (in quaternary logic).
%Y A137841 Subsequence of A000351.
