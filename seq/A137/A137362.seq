%N A137362 Positions at which the truncated square root of triangular numbers is unique.
%C A137362 For any term p of the sequence B(p) = 1+B(p-1) = -1+B(p+1), where B(p) = floor(p*(p-1)/2).
%C A137362 For any of others p, one of these equalities is wrong.
%C A137362 The difference between two successive isolated terms of the sequence is always 3 or 7 (a(4)-a(1) = 11-4 = 7, a(5)-a(4) = 14-11 = 3).
%C A137362 The difference between the first or second terms of two successive pairs of the sequence is always 7 or 10 (a(6)-a(2) = 17-7 = a(7)-a(3) = 18-8 = 10, a(9)-a(6) = 24-17 = a(10)-a(7) = 25-18 = 7).
%C A137362 For any n, a(n+13)-a(n) is always equal to 31 or 33. a(14)-a(1) = 35-4 = 31, a(16)-a(3) = 41-8 = 33.
%C A137362 Consider the slowly rising step function A061288 of truncated square roots. It attains unique (non-repeated) values A061288(j)=2,4,5,7,9,11,12,... once, whereas all others (1,3,6,8,10,..) occur at least twice. The values j+1 of the associated indices j=3,6,7,10,13,16 are listed here. - _R. J. Mathar_, May 05 2008
