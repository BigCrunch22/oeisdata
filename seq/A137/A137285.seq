%N A137285 a(1)=1. a(n+1) = a(n) + (number of terms of this sequence, from among terms a(1) through a(n), that are >= (1/n)sum{k=1 to n} a(k)).
%e A137285 The sum of the first 7 terms of this sequence is 1+2+3+5+7+9+12 = 39. So the arithmetic average of the first 7 terms is 39/7. The terms of this sequence, from among the first 7 terms, that are >= 39/7 (= 5 +4/7) are 7, 9, 12. There are therefore =3 such terms >= 39/7. So a(8) = a(7) + 3 = 12 + 3 = 15.
