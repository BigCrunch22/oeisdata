%N A137910 The game "n-Chicken" is played with a pile of n sticks. Player I may remove 1 or two sticks from the pile. Thereafter players may remove as many sticks as the opposing player removed, or one more stick than the opposing player removed or one fewer (but at least one stick). The first player without a legal move is the loser. The sequence of numbers consists of all n such that player II has a winning strategy for n-chicken.

%e A137910 n=3 is a win for player II as follows: If player I takes 1 stick, II can take II sticks. Since there are no sticks left in the pile, player I has no legal move and loses. Similarly, if I takes 2 stick, II can take 1 stick.
%e A137910 Note that n=1 and n=2 are wins for player I, who can take all the sticks in the pile in one move.
