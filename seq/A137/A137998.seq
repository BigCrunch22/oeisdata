%N A137998 Least k such that floor(16^n / 10^k) = 1, 2, 4 or 8 (mod 10), or zero if no such k exists.
%C A137998 Equivalent definition: position of least significant decimal digit in 16^n equal to one of {1,2,4,8}, or zero if none of these occur. Since this is the true meaning, the sequence is flagged "base", even if the actual definition does not explicitly refer to a base.
%C A137998 This is related to A071071, i.e., the conjecture by J. Shallit that {1,2,4,8,65536} is a minimal set for powers of 2 written in base 10. This amounts to saying that any power of 2 contains either a digit among {1,2,4,8}, or 65536 as subword (obtained by deleting zero or more digits of the number).
%C A137998 Any power 2^k ends in a digit among {1,2,4,8} except for k=4n, n>0, in which case 2^k=16^n ends in 6.
%C A137998 The present sequence gives the position of the first digit (starting with units) of these powers which is among {1,2,4,8}. It appears as if 16^4=65536 is the only power of 2 which does not contain any of these four digits. This would imply the conjecture (and be an even stronger statement).
%C A137998 The sequence has a repeating pattern of length 25 of the form
%C A137998 ( 1 2 A B C 1 2 2 D E 1 F 2 G H 1 2 J 2 2 1 K 2 L M )... where A-M follow again a repeating pattern:
%C A137998 A=(3,p,q,3,3)... ; C=(3,3,r,s,3)...; D=(t,3,3,3,u)...; etc.

%e A137998 a(1)=1 since 16^1 has a 1 in position 1 (10^1).
%e A137998 a(2)=2 since 16^2=256 has a 2 in position 2 (10^2).
%e A137998 a(3)=3 since 16^3=4096 has a 4 in position 3 (10^3).
%e A137998 a(4)=0 since 16^4=65536 has no digit 1,2,4 or 8.
%e A137998 If we arrange the terms in a 25-column matrix, we can see the pattern:
