%N A058162 Number of labeled Abelian groups with a fixed identity.
%C A058162 The distinction here between labeled and unlabeled Abelian groups is analogous to the distinction between unlabeled rooted trees (A000081) and labeled rooted trees (A000169).
%C A058162 That is, the number of Cayley tables. - _Artur Jasinski_, Mar 12 2008
%C A058162 Number of Latin squares in dimension n with first row and first column 1,2,3 ..., n which are associative and commutative (Abelian). Each of these squares is isomorphic with the Cayley table of one of the existed Abelian group in dimension n. - _Artur Jasinski_, Nov 02 2005. Cf. A111341.

%F A058162 a(n) = A034382(n) / n. Formula for A034382 is based on the fundamental theorem of finite Abelian groups  and the formula given by Hillar and Rhea (2007).
%e A058162 The 2 unlabeled Abelian groups of order 4 are C4 and C2^2. The 4 labeled Abelian groups whose identity is "0" consist of 3 of type C4 (where the nongenerator can be "2", "3", or "4") and 1 of type C2^2.
