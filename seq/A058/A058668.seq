%N A058668 Number of unlabeled graphs with n edges, no nodes of degree 1 and no cut nodes, under "series-equivalence"; multiple edges are allowed.
%C A058668 Under "series-equivalence" two graphs are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by exchanging two subgraphs in series: replacing -A-B- by -B-A-.
%C A058668 Start with the graph consisting of a single edge together with the graphs described in A058642; apply the operations of replacing edges by two edges in series or parallel; discard equivalent graphs; the result is A058668.
