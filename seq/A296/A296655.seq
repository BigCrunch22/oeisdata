%N A296655 Numbers k such that phi(x) = k has a positive even number of solutions.
%C A296655 When the number of solutions is 2, the sum of Sum_{d|x} d*mu(d) is always 0.
%C A296655 A007366 is contained in this sequence because it selects terms with the smallest even number of inverses.
%F A296655 0 = card({phi^-1(a(n))}) mod 2.
%e A296655 1 is a term because phi(1) has two inverses, 1, and 2.
%e A296655 6 is a term because phi(6) has four inverses, 7, 9, 14, and 18.
%e A296655 10 is a term because phi(10) has two inverses, 11, and 22.
%e A296655 18 is a term because phi(18) has four inverses, 19, 27, 38, 54.
%e A296655 348 is a term because phi(348) has six inverses, 349, 413, 531, 698, 826, and 1062.
