%N A296236 Prime-slideable numbers: such that a prime can be obtained by moving each digit d by d places either to the left or right, without creating a hole or overlap.
%C A296236 A 2-digit number 10a + b is in the sequence if |a - b| = 2 (or 0) and 10b + a is prime.
%e A296236 The number 35 is in the sequence because if the digit 3 is moved three places to the left and the digit 5 is moved five places to the left, this results in the number 53 (three place to the left from the initial position, which does not matter), and 53 is prime.
