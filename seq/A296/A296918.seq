%N A296918 List of coefficients of reduced chromatic polynomial of dodecahedron, highest order terms first.
%C A296918 The first displayed equation on page 70 of Biggs is supposed to give the chromatic polynomial of the dodecahedron.  However, I could not get this to produce the polynomial in A296919, which is taken from A218513.
