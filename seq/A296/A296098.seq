%N A296098 a(n) is the smallest triangular number (A000217) that can be represented as a product of k triangular numbers greater than 1 for all k = 1,2,...,n. a(n)=-1 if no such triangular number exists.
%C A296098 From _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Apr 21 2018: (Start)
%C A296098 Of the 482 triangular numbers < 55030954895280 that can be represented as a product of seven triangular numbers greater than 1, the only one that can be represented as a product of two triangular numbers greater than 1 is 218434391280, which cannot be represented as a product of 3 triangular numbers greater than 1. Thus, a(n) >= 55030954895280 for all n >= 7.
%C A296098 However, 55030954895280 can be represented (see Example section) as a product of k triangular numbers greater than 1 for all k in 1,2,...,12 (but not for k=13), so a(7) = a(8) = ... = a(12) = 55030954895280 (and, for each n > 12, a(n) > 55030954895280, or a(n) = -1 if no such number exists).
%C A296098 If, for some integer N > 12, it could be proved that a(N) = -1, then it would also be established that a(n) = -1 for every n > N. (End)
%F A296098 a(n) >= A212616(n) (unless a(n) = -1). - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Apr 21 2018
%e A296098 25200 is the smallest triangular number representable as a product of 2, 3 and 4 triangular numbers, 25200 = 210 * 120 = 120 * 21 * 10 = 28 * 15 * 10 * 6.
%e A296098 Therefore a(4)=25200.
%e A296098 Also, 25200 = 28 * 10 * 10 * 3 * 3, and therefore a(5)=25200.
