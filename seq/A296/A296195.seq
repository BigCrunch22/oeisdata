%N A296195 Number of disjoint covering systems of cardinality n.
%C A296195 A disjoint covering system or DCS (also called "exact covering system" or ECS) is a system of n congruences such that every integer belongs to exactly one of the congruences.
%C A296195 This sequence agrees with A050385 on the first 12 terms, but differs at a(13).

%e A296195 For n = 3 the a(3) = 3 DCS are
%e A296195 (i) x == 0 (mod 3), x == 1 (mod 3), x == 2 (mod 3)
%e A296195 (ii) x == 0 (mod 2), x == 1 (mod 4), x == 3 (mod 4)
%e A296195 (iii) x == 1 (mod 2), x == 0 (mod 4), x == 2 (mod 4)
%Y A296195 Cf. A050385, which counts a subset of the DCS called "natural exact covering systems".
