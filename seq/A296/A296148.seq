%N A296148 Number of shapes of grid-filling curves of order n (on the square grid) with turns by +-90 degrees that are generated by folding morphisms.
%C A296148 a(0)=1 and a(1)=1 correspond to the trivial (empty and single-stroke) curves of orders 0 and 1 respectively.
%C A296148 a(2) = 1 corresponds to the Heighway-Harter dragon (also known as paperfolding dragon).
