%N A296137 Smallest difference between the sums of n-th powers in an ideal solution to Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem of size n.
%C A296137 The smallest difference is delivered by the same ideal solutions as in A296136.
%H A296137 Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prouhet%E2%80%93Tarry%E2%80%93Escott_problem">Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem</a>
%e A296137 For n=4, the smallest difference is delivered by multisets {0,0,5,5} and {-1,2,3,6} with the sums of 4th powers equal 1250 and 1394, respectively. Their difference is 1394-1250 = 144 = a(4).
