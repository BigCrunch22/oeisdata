%N A296378 Fibonacci numbers that can be expressed as a sum of two or more Fibonacci numbers such that no digit appears more than once in the equation.
%C A296378 This sequence is finite because the Fibonacci sequence grows very fast, forcing some digit to repeat. The last term is a(5) = 34.
%e A296378 a(1) =  3 =  2 +  1.
%e A296378 a(2) =  5 =  2 +  3.
%e A296378 a(3) =  8 =  3 +  5.
%e A296378 a(4) = 13 =  5 +  8.
%e A296378 a(5) = 34 = 21 +  8 + 5.
