%N A296511 Number of toothpicks added at n-th stage to the toothpick structure of A296510.
%C A296511 The structure and the behavior of this cellular automaton reveals that some cellular automata have recurrent periods that can be represented by irregular triangles of first differences whose row lengths are the terms of A011782 multiplied by k (instead of powers of 2), where k is the length of their "word". In this case the word must be "abc", therefore k = 3. In the case of the cellular automaton with normal toothpicks (A139250) the word must be "ab" and k = 2.
%C A296511 The associated sound to the animation of this cellular automaton could be [tick, tock, tack], [tic, tock, tack], and so on.
%C A296511 For more information about the "word" of a cellular automaton see A296612.
