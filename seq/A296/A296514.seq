%N A296514 Positive numbers whose decimal expansion contains a 3-digit substring abc such that c > a > b.
%C A296514 The number of n-digit numbers that start with this substring is 12*10^(n-2), n>=3, hence about 12% of n-digit numbers are of this kind, n>=3. None of the numbers that start with this substring begin with 9.
%e A296514 The 3-digit numbers with this substring are 102, 103, ..., 109, ... 809, 819, ..., 879 (there are 120 of these).  The next numbers after 879 are 1020, 1021, etc. since they contain the string 102.
%e A296514 There are numbers of any length n, n>=3, with this substring, such as *213 or 213** where * is free since the string 213 is already there.
