%N A296339 On an infinite 60-degree sector of hexagonal graph paper, fill in cells by antidiagonals so that each contains the least nonnegative integer such that no line of edge-adjacent cells contains a repeated term.
%C A296339 To find the number to enter in a cell (assuming the sector is oriented as in the illustration in the link), look at all the numbers in the cells directly above the cell, in the cells to the "North-West", and in the cells to the "South-West", and take their "mex" (the smallest missing number).
%C A296339 The 0-cells in the array all lie on a perfectly straight line (in contrast to the situation in A274528). Also a(n) = 0 iff n = 2*m*(m+1) for some m.

%e A296339 For example, referring to the illustration in the link and NOT to the triangle here, consider the first 5 in the array. The reason this is 5 is because in the column of cells above that cell we can see 2,0,1, to the NW we see 3, and to the SW we see 4, and the smallest missing number is 5.
