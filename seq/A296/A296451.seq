%N A296451 Anagraprod Integers. Integers N that reproduce their exact set of digits when all the products of two successive digits of N are done (and considered together).
%C A296451 The sequence is infinite as each term can be extended with as many zeros as wanted. The name “anagraprod numbers” comes from “anagram by product”. The “anagrasum numbers” will be soon in the database (December 2017).

%e A296451 135 reproduces the digits 1, 3 and 5 (in a different order) when the products 1x3=3 and 3x5=15 are done. The same with 162 which reproduces the digit 1, 6 and 2 when the products 1x6=6 and 6x2=12 are made.
