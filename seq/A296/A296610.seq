%N A296610 Toothpick sequence on triangular grid in an infinite 60-degree wedge (see Comments lines for precise definition).
%C A296610 The rules are the same as the rules of A296510 (the toothpick sequence on triangular grid) but here we are in a 60-degree wedge. For the position of the initial toothpicks see the example.
%C A296610 a(n) gives the total number of toothpicks in the structure after n-th stage.
%C A296610 A296611, the first differences, gives the number of toothpicks added at n-th stage.
%C A296610 The "word" of this cellular automaton is "abc", the same as the word of A296510. For more information about the word of cellular automata see A296612.

%e A296610 .
%e A296610 At stage 0 there are no toothpicks in the wedge, so a(0) = 0.
%e A296610 At stage 1 we add a toothpick of length 2, so a(1) = 1.
%e A296610 At stage 2 we add a toothpick in horizontal position, so a(2) = a(1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. Note that in the structure there is a trapeze of area 5.
%e A296610 Then, at stage 3 we add a toothpick such that a equilateral triangle of area 1 appears in the wedge.
%e A296610 Then, at stage 4 we add a toothpick placed in the same position as the first toothpick.
%e A296610 And so on.
