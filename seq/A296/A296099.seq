%N A296099 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms such that, for any n > 0, SumXOR_{k=1..n} a(k) is divisible by n, where SumXOR is the analog of summation under the binary XOR operation.
%C A296099 The partial XOR sums are given by A295907.
%C A296099 This sequence is a "binary" variant of A019444.
%C A296099 This sequence has connections with A286681; graphically, both sequences have similar fractal features; in the scatterplot of the current sequence, the rays emerging from the origin correspond to the numerous terms a(n) that are multiples of n.
