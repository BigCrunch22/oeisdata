%N A296600 Number of pairs of binary strings (u,v) with u of length n, v of length 2n, and u and v mutually overlapping.
%C A296600 We say the pair (u,v) is mutually overlapping if some nonempty prefix of u is a suffix of v, and vice versa. For n = 3, an example is (011,110110). If C(m,n) is the number of mutually overlapping ordered pairs (u,v) with |u|=m and |v|=n, then C(m,2m+a) = 2^a C(m,2m) for a >= 0, so the case enumerated by this sequence is in some sense the most useful to understand.
