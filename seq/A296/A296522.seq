%N A296522 Number of disjoint covering systems of cardinality n with gcd of the moduli equal to 1.
%C A296522 A disjoint covering system (DCS) is a system of congruences of the form x == a_i (mod m_i) such that every integer lies in exactly one of the congruences. Here the "moduli" are the m_i.

%e A296522 An example of one of the 30 DCS with GCD 1 counted by a(13) is as follows:
%e A296522 x == 0,2 (mod 6)
%e A296522 x == 1,3,5,7 (mod 10)
%e A296522 x == 4 (mod 15)
%e A296522 x == 9,10,16,22,28,29 (mod 30)
%e A296522 Note that gcd(6,10,15,30) = 1.
