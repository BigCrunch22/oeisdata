%N A296510 Toothpick sequence on triangular grid (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A296510 We use toothpicks of length 2, the same as the toothpick cellular automaton of A139250, but here we are on triangular grid, hence we have three axes, not two.
%C A296510 The Toothpicks are alternately arranged on the three axes in a rotating cycle.
%C A296510 a(n) gives the number of toothpicks in the structure after n-th stage.
%C A296510 A296511 (the first differences) gives the number of toothpicks added at n-th stage.
%C A296510 The structure reveals that some cellular automata that have recurrent periods can be represented by irregular triangles of first differences whose row lengths are the terms of A011782 multiplied by k (instead of powers of 2), where k is the length of their "word". In this case the word should be "abc", therefore k = 3. In the case of the cellular automaton with normal toothpicks (A139250) the word should be "ab", therefore k = 2.
%C A296510 For more information about the "word" of a cellular automaton see A296612.
%C A296510 Note that due to the unusual orientation of the polygons that are located on the edges of the structure, the image of this cellular automaton resembles the photo of an object that is rotating.
%C A296510 Note that between other polygons the structure contains the same "petals" as the floret pentagonal tiling.
%C A296510 Apparently the graph could be similar to the graph of A151907.
