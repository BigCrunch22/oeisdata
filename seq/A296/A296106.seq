%N A296106 Square array T(n,k) n >= 1, k >= 1 read by antidiagonals: T(n, k) is the number of distinct Bojagi boards with dimensions n X k that have a unique solution.
%C A296106 Bojagi is a puzzle game created by David Radcliffe.
%C A296106 A Bojagi board is a rectangular board with some cells empty and some cells containing positive integers. A solution for a Bojagi board partitions the board into rectangles such that each rectangle contains exactly one integer, and that integer is the area of the rectangle.

%e A296106 If n=1 or k=1, any valid board (a board whose numbers add up to the area of the board) has a unique solution.
%e A296106 For n=2 and k=2, there are 17 boards that have a unique solution. There is 1 board in which each of the four cells has a 1.
%e A296106 There are 4 boards which contain two 2's. The 2's must be adjacent (not diagonally opposite) in order for the board to have a unique solution.
%e A296106 There are 8 boards which contain one 2 and two 1's. The 1's must be adjacent in order for the board to have a solution. The 2 can be placed in either of the remaining two cells.
%e A296106 There are 4 boards which contain one 4. It can be placed anywhere.
