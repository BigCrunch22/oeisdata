%N A296233 Numbers k such that U(i) is not isomorphic to U(k) for all i < k, where U(k) is the multiplicative group of integers modulo k.
%C A296233 Numbers k such that A289626(i) < A289626(k) for all i < k.
%C A296233 All odd primes are in this sequence. This sequence contains almost all odd numbers.
%C A296233 Numbers k divisible by 2 but not by 4 are not members since U(k) is isomorphic to U(k/2) (i.e., 2, 6, 10, 14, ... are not terms).
%C A296233 Numbers k divisible by 4 but not by 3 or 8 are not members since U(k) is isomorphic to U(3/4*k) (i.e., 4, 20, 28, 44, ... are not terms).
%C A296233 Numbers k divisible by 12 but not by 24 or 36 are not members since U(k) is isomorphic to U(2/3*k) (i.e., 12, 60, 84, 132, ... are not terms).
%C A296233 Numbers k divisible by 9 but not by 7 or 27 are not members since U(k) is isomorphic to U(7/9*k) (i.e., 9, 18, 36, 45, 72, ... are not terms).
%C A296233 Numbers k divisible by 27 but not by 19 or 81 are not members since U(k) is isomorphic to U(19/27*k) (i.e., 27, 54, 108, 135, ... are not terms).
%C A296233 First term == 4 (mod 8) is 252.

%e A296233 75 is not a term because U(55) and U(75) are both isomorphic to C_2 x C_20.
%e A296233 93 is not a term because U(77) and U(93) are both isomorphic to C_2 x C_30.
%e A296233 96 is a term because U(96) is isomorphic to C_2 x C_2 x C_8 and U(k) is not isomorphic to C_2 x C_2 x C_8 for all k < 96.
