%N A156547 Decimal expansion of the central angle of a regular dodecahedron.
%C A156547 If A and B are neighboring vertices of a regular dodecahedron having center O, then the central angle AOB is this number; the exact value is arccos((1/3)*sqrt(5)) = arcsin(2/3).
%C A156547 The (minimal) central angle of the other four regular polyhedra are as follows:
%C A156547 - tetrahedron: A156546,
%C A156547 - cube: A137914,
%C A156547 - octahedron: A019669,
%C A156547 - icosahedron: A105199.
%F A156547 The dodecahedron has 12 faces and 20 vertices. To find the central angle, we need any neighboring pair of vertices. Here are all 20 vertices:
%F A156547 - (d,d,d) where d is 1 or -1 (that's 8 vertices);
%F A156547 - (0, d*(t-1),d*t), where d is 1 or -1 and d = golden ratio = (1+sqrt(5))/2;
%F A156547 - (d*(t-1), d*t, 0); and ((d*t,0,d*(t-1)).
%F A156547 An example of a neighboring pair is (1,1,1) and (0,t,t-1).
%F A156547 Apply the usual formula for the cosine of the angle between two vectors.
