%N A156642 Number of decompositions of 4n+2 into unordered sums of two primes of the form 4k+3.
%C A156642 Conjecture. For n >= 1, a(n) > 0. This conjecture does not follow from the validity of the Goldbach binary conjecture because numbers of the form 4n+2, generally speaking, also have decompositions into sums of two primes of the form 4k+1.

%e A156642 From _Lei Zhou_, Mar 19 2013: (Start)
%e A156642 n=1: 4n+2=6, 6=3+3; this is the only case that matches the definition, so a(1)=1;
%e A156642 n=3: 4n+2=14, 14=3+11=7+7; two instances found, so a(3)=2. (End)
