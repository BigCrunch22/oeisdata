%N A156241 Triangle read by rows, T(n,k). If k divides n then A008683(n)*A008683(k).
%C A156241 A008683 is found in the first column. A087003 appears in the second column.
%C A156241 The definition does not match the values for n=k. Apparently T(n,n) has been set to 1, not mu(n)*mu(n). [From _R. J. Mathar_, Mar 14 2009]
