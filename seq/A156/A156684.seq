%N A156684 The number of primitive Pythagorean triples A^2+B^2=C^2 with 0 < A < B < C and gcd(A,B)=1, and both legs less than n.
%C A156684 For large N, Benito and Varona have shown that a(N)~2/pi^2 Log(1+sqrt(2)).N +O(sqrt(N)). However, the approximations to a(N)/N are considerably more accurate than the error term suggests, and it certainly appears that the density of the primitive triples with both legs less than N tends towards 2/pi^2 Log(1+sqrt(2))=0.1786... as N becomes large.

%e A156684 There are two primitive triples with both legs less than 14, specifically (3,4,5) and (5,12,13). Hence a(14)=2.
