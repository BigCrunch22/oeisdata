%N A156902 Primes p such that there is no multiple of (the order of p among the primes) between p and q, where q is the smallest prime > p.
%C A156902 If pi(p) is the order of the prime p, then p is included in the sequence if pi(p)*ceiling(p/pi(p)) > the (pi(p)+1)th prime.
%C A156902 The sequence of primes not in the list is less dense: 2, 3, 5, 7, 23, 29, 31, 89, 97, 113, 317, 331, 337, 349, 353, 359, 997, 1069, 1091, 1109, 1117, 1123, 1129, 3049, 3061, 3067, 3079, 3083, 3089, ... - _R. J. Mathar_, Feb 21 2009
%e A156902 37 is the 12th prime. 41 is the 13th prime. Since there is no multiple of 12 between 37 and 41, then 37 is included in the sequence.
