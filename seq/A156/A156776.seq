%N A156776 Number of iterations of x->(sigma(x)+phi(x))/2 until a non-integer is reached when starting with x=n; a(n)=0 if this never happens.
%C A156776 In [Guy 1997] the iteration is said to fracture when sigma(x)+phi(x) becomes odd. For n with a(n)=0, A156775(n) gives the number of iterations until a previously seen term is encountered.

%e A156776 Let f(x)=(sigma(x)+phi(x))/2. For x=1 we have f(x) = (1+1)/2 = 1, i.e. this is a fixed point and the sequence will never fraction, hence a(1)=0. The same happens for x=2, x=3 and x=5. For x=4 we have f(x) = (7+2)/2 = 9/2, the sequence "fractures" after a(4)=1 iterations. For x=6 we have f(x) = (12+2)/2 = 7, f(7) = (8+6)/2 = 7, a fixed point, so again a(6)=a(7)=0.
