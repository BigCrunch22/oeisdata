%N A156972 Number of universes with n entities, exactly one being the empty set, which satisfy the Axiom of Extensionality (two sets are identical when they have the same elements) and are closed under taking subsets.
%C A156972 These universes need not satisfy the Power Set Axiom.
%e A156972 1 entity = 1 universe that consists of the empty set. 2 entities = 2 universes: when a = {{}}, when a = {a} on the other hand. 3 entities = 6 universes: a = {{}}, b = {a}; a = {{}}, b = {b}; and so on. 4 entities = 60 universes...
