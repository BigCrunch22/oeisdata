%N A156590 Decimal expansion of the imaginary part of the limit of f(f(...f(0)...)) where f(z)=sqrt(i+z).
%C A156590 The real part, 1.300242590..., is given by A156548.
%C A156590 Coincides with the limit of the imaginary part of the same expression, but with f(z)=i/(1+z), and therefore with the imaginary part of the continued fraction i/(1+i/(1+i/(...))). It is also equal to the real part of the continued fraction i/(i+i/(i+i/(...))). - _Stanislav Sykora_, May 27 2015
%F A156590 Define z(1)=f(0)=sqrt(i), where i=sqrt(-1), and z(n)=f(z(n-1)) for n>1.
%F A156590 Write the limit of z(n) as a+bi where a and b are real. Then a=(b+1)/(2b), where b=sqrt((sqrt(17)-1)/8).
