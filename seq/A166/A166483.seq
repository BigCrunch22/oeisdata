%N A166483 Number of integers in [1..A112141(n)] that are multiples of the first n semiprimes, where A112141(n) is the product of the first n semiprimes.
%C A166483 Previous name: Numerator of sequence of ratios of semiprimes and multiples thereof in intervals of length 4*6, 4*6*9, 4*6*9*10,...[A112141] to the length of the interval. See example below. The first few ratios are: 1/4, 8/24, 84/216, 912/2160,...
%C A166483 Conjecture: sequences for 2-ads, 3-ads (composites of 3 primes), 4-ads, etc., converge to 1/2, 1/4, 1/8,..., respectively.
%C A166483 The first few analogous ratios for 3-ads are: 1/8, 16/96, 336/1728, 7296/34560,...
%e A166483 For n=2, 4*6 is the denominator (product of first two semiprimes), and there 8 multiples of the semiprimes 4,6 in the interval, including those two semiprimes, repetitions (such as 4*3, 2*6) are only counted once. So a(2) = 8 and the ratio is then 8/24.
%o A166483 (PARI) ismul(x, v) = for (k=1, #v, if ((x % v[k]) == 0, return(1)););
%o A166483 vsp(n) = my(v=vector(n), i, k=3); while(i<n, if(bigomega(k++)==2, v[i++]=k)); v;
%o A166483 a(n) = my(v = vsp(n)); sum(k=1, vecprod(v), ismul(k, v)); \\ _Michel Marcus_, Aug 16 2022
