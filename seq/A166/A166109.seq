%N A166109 a(1)=5. For n >= 2, a(n) = the smallest prime p > a(n-1) where neither p+1 nor p-1 is divisible by any (earlier) term of this sequence.
%C A166109 This sequence would have terminated after only one term if a(1) equaled 2 or 3.

%e A166109 a(5) = 37. So we want to look at the primes > 37 to get a(6). 41 - 1 is divisible by a(1)=5. (And 41+1 is divisible by a(2)=7.) 43-1 is divisible by a(2)=7. 47-1 is divisible by a(4)=23. By 53-1 is not divisible by any earlier terms of the sequence, and 53+1 is not divisible by any earlier terms of the sequence. So a(6) = 53.
