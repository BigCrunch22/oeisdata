%N A166011 Least common multiple of prime(n)-3 and prime(n)+3.
%C A166011 From _Altug Alkan_, Apr 22 2016: (Start)
%C A166011 For n > 1, a(n) is (p-3)*(p+3)/2 where p is the n-th prime. The reason is that the greatest common divisor of p-3 and p+3 is always 2 where p is the n-th prime and n > 2.
%C A166011 Proof: Let us assume that q is the greatest common divisor of p-3 and p+3. Because of the fact that any divisor of a and b must divide a-b, we know that q must divide 6. Note that q cannot be a multiple of 3 because p is prime, that is, q must be 1 or 2. Since we know that p-3 and p+3 are always even numbers for odd prime p, q must be 2 because we define it as the greatest common divisor.
%C A166011 If the greatest common divisor of p-3 and p+3 is always 2 where p is the n-th prime and n > 2, then the least common multiple of p-3 and p+3 must be (p-3)*(p+3)/2 where p is the n-th prime and n > 2 because of the general identity lcm(a, b) * gcd(a, b) = a*b. Note that for p = 3, (p-3)*(p+3)/t always is equal to 0 for any nonzero integer t, so it can be said that a(n) is (p-3)*(p+3)/2 where p is the n-th prime and n > 1. (End)
