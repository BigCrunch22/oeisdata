%N A166475 4th level primorials: product of first n superduperprimorials.
%C A166475 Next term has 110 digits.
%C A166475 a(n) = first counting number with n distinct positive tetrahedral exponents in its prime factorization (cf. A000292).
%C A166475 Note: a(n) is not the first counting number with n distinct square exponents in its prime factorization, as previously stated.  That sequence is A212170. - _Matthew Vandermast_, May 23 2012
