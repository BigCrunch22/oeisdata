%N A166742 Arises in enumeration of three-dimensional crystallographic Seifert and co-Seifert fibrations.
%C A166742 p.25 of Ratcliffe: "The information in Table 1 was obtained by computer calculations. Finally, the 10 closed flat space forms in Table 1 have IT numbers 1,4,7,9,19,29,33,76,144,169."
%C A166742 The "IT numbers" here are merely numbers of certain 3D space groups in the International Tables for Crystallography. Thus, the terms of this sequence don't have their own mathematical meaning. - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Jul 05 2017
