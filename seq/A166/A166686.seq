%N A166686 Numbers m such that m plus the sum of the indices of the prime factors of the m-th composite (counted with multiplicity) is prime.
%e A166686 1st composite = 4 = 2*2 = (1st prime)*(1st prime) and 1+1+1=3 (prime), so 1 is in the sequence.
%e A166686 2nd composite = 6 = 2*3 = (1st prime)*(2nd prime) and 2+1+2=5 (prime), so 2 is in the sequence.
