%N A166469 Number of divisors of n which are not multiples of consecutive primes.
%C A166469 Links various subsequences of A025487 with an unusual number of important sequences, including the Fibonacci, Lucas, and other generalized Fibonacci sequences (see cross-references).
%C A166469 If a number is a product of any number of consecutive primes, the number of its divisors which are not multiples of n consecutive primes is always a Fibonacci n-step number. See also A073485, A167447.

%F A166469 a) If n has no prime gaps in its factorization (cf. A073491), then, if the canonical factorization of n into prime powers is the product of p_i^(e_i), a(n) is the sum of all products of one or more nonadjacent exponents, plus 1. For example, if A001221(n) = 3, a(n) = e_1*e_3 + e_1 + e_2 + e_3 + 1. If A001221(n) = k, the total number of terms always equals A000045(k+2).
%F A166469 The answer can also be computed in k steps, by finding the answers for the products of the first i powers, for i = 1 to i = k. Let the result of the i-th step be called r(i). r(1) = e_1 + 1; r(2) = e_1 + e_2 +1; for i > 2, r(i) = r(i-1) + e_i * r(i-2).
%F A166469 b) If n has prime gaps in its factorization, express it as a product of the minimum number of A073491's members possible. Then apply either of the above methods to each of those members, and multiply the results to get a(n). a(n) = A000005(n) iff n has no pair of consecutive primes as divisors.
