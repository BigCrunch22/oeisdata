%N A166111 A positive integer n is included if the longest contiguous run of similar digits in binary n is of 1's.
%C A166111 For some n included in this sequence, it is possible that the longest run of 0's in binary n is of the same length as the longest run of 1's in binary n. (See sequence A090050.)
