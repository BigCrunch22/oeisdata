%N A166476 Number of stable n-celled patterns ("still lifes") in the 2x2 (B36/S125) cellular automaton.
%C A166476 Counts only distinct strict still lifes; reflections and rotations are removed. Pseudo-still lifes (e.g., patterns made up of two disjoint still lifes) are not counted.
%H A166476 LifeWiki, <a href="https://conwaylife.com/wiki/OCA:2%C3%972">2x2</a>
%e A166476 a(3) = 1 because there is only one distinct still life with three cells: a diagonal line of length three.
