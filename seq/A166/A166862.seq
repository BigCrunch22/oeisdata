%N A166862 Primes p that divide n! + 1 for some n other than p-1.
%C A166862 For n >= p, p is one of the factors of n!, so p cannot divide n! + 1. As a result, only 0 <= n <= p-2 needs to be searched.
%C A166862 For n = p-1, by Wilson's Theorem, (p-1)! = -1 (mod p), so p divides (p-1)! + 1.
%C A166862 Since by convention 0! = 1, 2 is included in the sequence as dividing 0!+1 = 2.
%C A166862 The standard heuristic suggests that the fraction of primes in this sequence is 1 - 1/e or about 63%. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Apr 17 2013

%e A166862 11 is included in the sequence since 11 divides 5! + 1 = 121.
%e A166862 13 is not included in the sequence since the only n for which 13 divides n! + 1 is n = 12.
