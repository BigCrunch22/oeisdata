%N A166731 Positive integers with English names ending in "d".
%C A166731 To avoid ambiguity, the American system is used here; i.e., no names such as "milliard" or "billiard".
%C A166731 Different from multiples of 100 (see example) and from A044332 (10100 is a term of the present sequence). In fact, if all names of multiples of a million are considered to end with an "n" (even beyond the usual naming system: see A146755 for links), those numbers are terms of A060228, not this sequence, meaning this sequence is precisely {positive multiples of 100} MINUS {(positive) multiples of 1000000}.
%e A166731 One hundred (100) is a term; one million (1000000) is not a term (but is a term of A060228).
%Y A166731 Cf. A166726, A166727, A166728, A166729, A166730, A059093, A060228.
