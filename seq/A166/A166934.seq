%N A166934 A positive integer n is included if the longest palindromic substring (or at least one of which that is tied for longest) in the binary representation of n consists of different valued digits (0 and 1).
%C A166934 All terms of this sequence are contained in sequence A101082. (47 is the first integer that is in A101082, but is not in this sequence.)
%e A166934 29 in binary is 11101. There are two substrings in this that are tied for longest palindromic substring, 111 and 101. Since 101 contains both a 0 and 1's, then 29 is in this sequence.
