%N A166853 a(n) is the smallest number m such that m^m-n is prime, or zero if there is no such m.

%C A166853 If they exist, the first two unknown terms, a(26) and a(28), they are greater than 10000. All other unknown terms a(n), for n<112 are greater than 4000.
%C A166853 If it exists, a(26) > 25000. - _Robert Price_, Apr 26 2019
%F A166853 a(n)=0 if n=3^2 or n=(2k+1)^2 > 25, or n = (6k+1)^3 = A016923(k) with k>0.
%e A166853 We have a(1)=2 since 1^1-1 is not prime, but 2^2-1 is prime.
%e A166853 a(9)=0 since 2^2-9 is not prime, and if m is an even number greater than 2 then m^m-9=(m^(m/2)-3)*(m^(m/2)+3) is composite. So there is no number m such that m^m-9 is prime. The same applies to any odd square > 25.
%e A166853 We have a(25)=3 since 3^3-25=2 is prime. But 25 is the only known square of the form m^m-2, so a(n)=0 for other odd squares > 25, e.g., n = 49,81,121,....
%e A166853 a(115)=2736 is the largest known term. 2736^2736-115 is a probable prime.
