%N A166864 Primes p that divide n! - 1 for some n > 1 other than p-2.
%C A166864 Since n! - 1 = 0 for n=1 and n=2, the restriction n > 1 needed to be placed.
%C A166864 For n >= p, p is one of the factors of n!, so p cannot divide n! - 1.
%C A166864 For n = p-1, by Wilson's Theorem, (p-1)! = -1 (mod p), so p divides (p-1)! + 1, and cannot also divide (p-1)! - 1 unless p = 2.
%C A166864 For n = p-2, again by Wilson's Theorem, (p-1)! = (p-1)(p-2)! = (-1)(p-2)! = -1 (mod p), so (p-2)! = 1 (mod p) and p divides (p-2)! - 1. As a result, only 2 <= n <= p-3 needs to be searched.

%e A166864 17 is included in the sequence since 17 divides 5! - 1 = 119.
%e A166864 19 is not included in the sequence since the only n for which 19 divides n! - 1 is n = 17.
