%N A166301 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of Dyck paths of semilength n, having no ascents and no descents of length 1, and having pyramid weight k.
%C A166301 A pyramid in a Dyck word (path) is a factor of the form U^h D^h, h being the height of the pyramid. A pyramid in a Dyck word w is maximal if, as a factor in w, it is not immediately preceded by a U and immediately followed by a D. The pyramid weight of a Dyck path (word) is the sum of the heights of its maximal pyramids.
%C A166301 Sum of entries in row n is the secondary structure number A004148(n-1) (n>=2).
%C A166301 T(n,n)=A000045(n-1) (n>=1; the Fibonacci numbers).
%C A166301 Sum(k*T(n,k), k>=0)=A166302(n).

%F A166301 G.f.: G=G(t,z) satisfies G = 1 + zG[G - 1 + tz - tz(1 - t)/(1 - tz)].
%e A166301 T(6,5)=2 because we have U(UUDD)(UUUDDD)D and U(UUUDDD)(UUDD)D (the maximal pyramids are shown between parentheses).
