%N A335739 Numbers k such that the area of an equilateral triangle of side k falls in between twin primes.
%C A335739 The number 3 is the only value where the area is between twin primes with 3 as one of the twins.
%e A335739 An equilateral triangle of side 3 has an area A = (sqrt(3)/4) * 3^2 = 3.89711, which is between 3 and 5, which are twin primes; so 3 is a term.
%e A335739 An equilateral triangle of side 17 has an area A = (sqrt(3)/4) * 17^2 = 125.14 which is between 125 and 127. These are not twin primes; so 17 is not a term.
