%N A335206 a(n) is the total binary weight of all persolus bitstrings of length n.
%C A335206 A bitstring is persolus if all of its 1's are isolated and each of its 0's possess at least one neighboring 0.  The number of persolus bitstrings of length n is A179070(n+1).

%F A335206 G.f.: x*(1-x+x^2)^2/(1-x-x^3)^2.
%e A335206 The only three persolus bitstrings of length 3 are 000, 100 and 001. The bitsums of these are 0, 1 and 1. Adding these give a(3)=2.
%e A335206 The only four persolus bitstrings of length 4 are 0000, 1000, 0001, and 1001. The bitsums of these are 0, 1, 1, and 2. Adding these give a(4)=4.
%e A335206 The only five persolus bitstrings of length 5 are 00000, 10000, 00100, 00001, and 10001. The bitsums of these are 0, 1, 1, 1 and 2. Adding these give a(5)=5.
%e A335206 The only eight persolus bitstrings of length 6 are 000000, 100000, 001000, 000100, 000001, 100100, 100001, and 001001. The bitsums of these are 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2 and 2. Adding these give a(6)=10.
