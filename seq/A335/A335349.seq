%N A335349 a(n) counts anti-chains of size three in "0,1,2" Motzkin trees on n edges.
%C A335349 "0,1,2" trees are rooted trees where each vertex has outdegree zero, one, or two. They are counted by the Motzkin numbers A001006.
%C A335349 A005717(n+1) is the total number of vertices (= anti-chains of size 1) in all "0,1,2" trees with n edges, while A178834(n) is the total number of anti-chains of size 2 in all "0,1,2" trees on n edges.

%F A335349 G.f. is A000108(r-1) * z^(2*r-2) * T(z)^(2*r-1) * M(z)^r = 2 * z^4 * T(z)^5 * M(z)^3 (with r = 3),  where M(z) = (1 - z - sqrt(1 - 2*z - 3*z^2)) / (2*z^2) is the g.f. of the Motzkin numbers A001006 and T(z) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 2*z - 3*z^2) is the g.f. of the central trinomial numbers A002426.
%e A335349 Out of the A001006(4) = 9 Motzkin rooted trees, there are only two that have anti-chains of size 3 (i.e., 3-sets of pairwise incomparable nodes), and each one has only one such an anti-chain. Thus, a(4) = 1 + 1 = 2.
%e A335349 In the first Motzkin tree below with 4 edges, {E, C, D} is an anti-chain of size 3. In the second one, {G, I, K} is an anti-chain of size 3.
