%N A335838 Number of normal patterns contiguously matched by integer partitions of n.
%C A335838 We define a (normal) pattern to be a finite sequence covering an initial interval of positive integers. Patterns are counted by A000670 and ranked by A333217. A sequence S is said to contiguously match a pattern P if there is a contiguous subsequence of S whose parts have the same relative order as P. For example, (3,1,1,3) contiguously matches (1,1,2) and (2,1,1) but not (2,1,2), (1,2,1), (1,2,2), or (2,2,1).

%e A335838 The patterns contiguously matched by (3,2,2,1) are: (), (1), (1,1), (2,1), (2,1,1), (2,2,1), (3,2,2,1). Note that (3,2,1) is not contiguously matched. See A335837 for a larger example.
