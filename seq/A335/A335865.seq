%N A335865 Moduli a(n) = v(n) for the simple difference sets of Singer type of order m(n) (v(n), m(n)+1, 1) in the additive group modulo v(n) = m(n)^2 + m(n) + 1, with m(n) = A000961(n).
%C A335865 For details on these difference sets see A333852, with references, and a W. Lang link.
%C A335865 Because these simple difference sets of Singer type of order m = m(n) in the addive group (Z_{v(n)}, +) = RS(v(n)) = {0, 1, ..., v(n)-1} are also simple symmetric balanced incomplete block designs (BIBD), the number of blocks b(n) is also v(n) = a(n). This is the number of simple difference sets of each of the A335865(n) classes.

%F A335865 a(n) = m(n)^2 + m(n) + 1 , with m(n) = A000961(n), for n >= 1.
%e A335865 n = 2, m(2) = 2, a(2) = 2^2 + 2 + 1 = 7. The simple Singer difference set of order 2 is denoted by (7, 3, 1) (Fano plane). There are two classes (A335866(2) = 2) obtained from the representative difference sets {0, 1, 3} and {0, 1, 5} by element-wise addition of 1, 2, ..., 6 taken modulo 7. Each class consists of 7 simple difference sets.
