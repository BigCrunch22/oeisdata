%N A335331 a(n) = prime(k) where k is the n-th 7-smooth number.
%C A335331 At A110069 we look for numbers of the form  n = (d_1 + d_2 + ... + d_k)*prime(d_1*d_2*...*d_k) where d_1 d_2 ... d_k is the decimal expansion of n. As the largest prime that can be among the digits of a base-10 number is 7, the product of digits is 7-smooth. Hence the factor prime(d_1*d_2*...*d_k) is a term from this sequence. As lots of numbers have a product of digits of, say, 210^4, it would help to know prime(210^4) in advance. That's a(5817) of this sequence as 210^4 is the 5817th 7-smooth number. Precomputing such numbers is a computational benefit.
