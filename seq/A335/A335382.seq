%N A335382 a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) = a(n-1) - sigma(n) if nonnegative and not already in the sequence, otherwise a(n) = a(n-1) + sigma(n), where sigma(n) is the sum of the divisors of n.
%C A335382 This sequences uses the same rules as Recam√°n's sequence A005132 except that, instead of adding or subtracting n each term, the sum of the divisors of n is used. See A000203.
%C A335382 For the first 10 million terms the smallest value not appearing is 76. It is likely that all values are eventually visited, although this is unknown.
%C A335382 In the same range the maximum value is a(9297600) = 93571073, and 402979 terms repeat a previously visited value, the first time this occurs is a(23) = a(9) = 41. The longest run of consecutive increasing terms is 5, starting at a(105187) = 25833, while the longest run of consecutive decreasing terms is 7, starting at a(6826248) = 83016261.
%e A335382 a(2) = 4. As sigma(2) = 3, and a(1)<3, a(2) = a(1) + 3 = 4.
%e A335382 a(4) = 15. As sigma(4) = 7, and 1 has previously appeared, a(4) = a(3) + 7 = 15.
%e A335382 a(5) = 9. As sigma(5) = 6, and 9 has not previously appeared, a(5) = a(4) - 6 = 9.
