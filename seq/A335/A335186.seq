%N A335186 a(n) = nextprime(ceiling(n/2)-1) + prevprime(floor(n/2)+1), where nextprime = A151800 and prevprime = A151799.
%C A335186 a(n) is the sum of the smallest prime appearing among the largest parts of the partitions of n into two parts and the largest prime appearing among the smallest parts of the partitions of n into two parts.
%C A335186 If n = 2p where p is prime, then a(n) = n. The converse is not true since a(8) = 8, but n = 2*4 and 4 is not prime.
%C A335186 All terms are even except a(5).

%F A335186 a(n) = A151800(ceiling(n/2)-1) + A151799(floor(n/2)+1).
%e A335186 a(5) = 5; n=5 has 2 partitions into two parts: (4,1) and (3,2). Among the largest parts, the smallest prime is 3. Among the smallest parts, 2 is the largest. So a(5) = 3 + 2 = 5.
%e A335186 a(6) = 6; n=6 has 3 partitions into two parts: (5,1), (4,2) and (3,3). Among the largest parts, the smallest prime is 3. Among the smallest parts, the largest prime is 3. So a(6) = 3 + 3 = 6.
%e A335186 a(7) = 8; n=7 has 3 partitions into two parts: (6,1), (5,2) and (4,3). Among the largest parts, 5 is the smallest. Among the smallest parts, 3 is the largest. So a(7) = 5 + 3 = 8.
