%N A335267 Composite numbers whose harmonic mean of their divisors that are larger than 1 is an integer.
%C A335267 The primes are excluded from this sequence since they are trivial terms.
%C A335267 The corresponding harmonic means are 3, 5, 5, 5, 13, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 37, ...
%C A335267 Equivalently, composite numbers m such that (sigma(m)-m) | m*(tau(m)-1), or A001065(m) | A168014(m).
%C A335267 The semiprimes terms of this sequence are of the form p*q where p and q = 2*p - 1 are primes (A129521).
%C A335267 If m is a k-perfect numbers, k = 2, 3, ... (i.e., sigma(m) = k*m), then sigma(m)-m = (k-1)*m. If (k-1)*m | m*(tau(m)-1) then (k-1) | (tau(m)-1). If k is odd then tau(m) is also odd, so m is a square, and sigma(m) is odd. Since m | sigma(m) this means that m is also odd. Since there is no known odd multiply-perfect number except for 1 (A007691), there are no known k-perfect numbers with odd k in this sequence.
%C A335267 The perfect numbers (k=2, A000396) are terms: if m is a perfect number then sigma(m)-m = m.
%C A335267 The 4-perfect number (k=4, A027687) m are terms if 3 | (tau(m)-1). Of the first 36 terms of A027687 there are 8 such terms, the first is A027687(26).
%C A335267 The 6-perfect number (k=6, A046061) m are terms if 5 | (tau(m)-1). Of the first 245 terms of A046061 there are 20 such terms, the first is A046061(19).
%C A335267 Hemiperfect numbers that are terms of this sequence include A055153(i) for i = 10, 18 and 20, A141645(21), and A159271(i) for i = 97 and 103.

%e A335267 6 is a term since its divisors other than 1 are 2, 3 and 6, and their harmonic mean, 3/(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/6) = 3, is an integer.
