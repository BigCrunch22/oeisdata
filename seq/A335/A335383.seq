%N A335383 a(n) is the number of irreducible Mersenne polynomials in GF(2)[x] that have degree n.
%C A335383 A Mersenne polynomial is a binary (i.e., an element of GF(2)[x]) polynomial M, of degree > 1, such that M+1 has only 0 and 1 as roots in a fixed algebraic closure of GF(2).
%C A335383 If for some positive integers  a,b, M = x^a(x+1)^b+1 is an irreducible Mersenne polynomial, then gcd(a,b)=1. This condition is not sufficient.
%C A335383 There is no known formula for a(n). Of course it is bounded above by the total number of prime (irreducible) binary polynomials of degree n, but this is a too weak upper bound. A trivial, better upper bound, is simply n-1, the total number of Mersenne polynomials (prime or not) of degree n.

%e A335383 For n = 5 one has a(5) = 2 since there are 2 irreducible Mersenne polynomials of degree 5. Namely, x^2*(x+1)^3+1 and x^3*(x+1)^2+1.
%e A335383 For n = 8, a(8) = 0 since there are no irreducible Mersenne polynomial of degree 8.
