%N A335806 The number of n-step self avoiding walks on a 3D cubic lattice confined inside a box of size 2x2x2 where the walk starts at the middle of the box's edge.
%F A335806 For n>=27 all terms are 0 as the walk contains more steps than there are available lattice points in the 2x2x2 box.
%e A335806 a(1) = 4 as the walk is free to move one step in four directions.
%e A335806 a(2) = 12. A first step along either edge leading to the corner leaves two possible second steps. A first step to the centre of either face can be followed by a second step to three edges or to the center of the cube, four steps in all. Thus the total number of 2-step walks is 2*2+2*4 = 12.
%e A335806 a(26) = 0 as it is not possible to visit all 26 available lattice points when the walk starts from the middle of the box's edge.
%Y A335806 Cf. A336862 (other box sizes), A337021 (start at center of box), A337033 (start at center of face), A337034 (start at corner of box), A001412, A259808, A039648.
