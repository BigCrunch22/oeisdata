%N A335516 Number of normal patterns contiguously matched by the prime indices of n in increasing or decreasing order, counting multiplicity.
%C A335516 First differs from A181796 at a(180) = 9, A181796(180) = 10.
%C A335516 First differs from A335549 at a(90) = 7, A335549(90) = 8.
%C A335516 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798.
%C A335516 We define a (normal) pattern to be a finite sequence covering an initial interval of positive integers. Patterns are counted by A000670 and ranked by A333217. A sequence S is said to contiguously match a pattern P if there is a contiguous subsequence of S whose parts have the same relative order as P. For example, (3,1,1,3) contiguously matches (1,1,2) and (2,1,1) but not (2,1,2), (1,2,1), (1,2,2), or (2,2,1).
