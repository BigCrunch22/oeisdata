%N A335738 Factorize each integer m >= 2 as the product of powers of nonunit squarefree numbers with distinct exponents that are powers of 2. The sequence lists m such that the factor with the largest exponent is a power of 2.
%C A335738 2 is the only term not divisible by 4. All powers of 2 are present. Every term divisible by an odd square is divisible by 16, the first such being 144.
%C A335738 The defined factorization is unique. Every positive number is a product of at most one squarefree number (A005117), at most one square of a squarefree number (A062503), at most one 4th power of a squarefree number (A113849), at most one 8th power of a squarefree number, and so on.
%C A335738 Iteratively map m using A000188, until 1 is reached, as A000188^k(m), for some k >= 1. m is in the sequence if and only if the preceding number, A000188^(k-1)(m), is 2. k can be shown to be A299090(m).
%C A335738 Closed under squaring, but not closed under multiplication: 12 = 3^1 * 2^2 and 432 = 3^1 * 3^2 * 2^4 are in the sequence, but 12 * 432 = 5184 = 3^4 * 2^6 = 2^2 * 6^4 is not.
%C A335738 The asymptotic density of this sequence is Sum_{k>=0} (d(2^(k+1)) - d(2^k))/2^(2^(k+1)-1) = 0.21363357193921052068..., where d(k) = 2^(k-1)/((2^k-1)*zeta(k))) is the asymptotic density of odd k-free numbers for k >= 2, and d(1) = 0. - _Amiram Eldar_, Feb 10 2024

%e A335738 6 is a squarefree number, so its factorization for the definition (into powers of nonunit squarefree numbers with distinct exponents that are powers of 2) is the trivial "6^1". 6^1 is therefore the factor with the largest exponent, and is not a power of 2, so 6 is not in the sequence.
%e A335738 48 factorizes for the definition as 3^1 * 2^4. The factor with the largest exponent is 2^4, which is a power of 2, so 48 is in the sequence.
%e A335738 10^100 (a googol) factorizes in this way as 10^4 * 10^32 * 10^64. The factor with the largest exponent, 10^64, is a power of 10, not a power of 2, so 10^100 is not in the sequence.
