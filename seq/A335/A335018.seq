%N A335018 Number of triples (d1,d2,d3) where each element is a divisor of m and d1 + d2 + d3 <= m where m is least odd integer of each prime signature.
%C A335018 All terms are cubes. Proof: Let d_k be the k-th divisor of some odd m > 1 and t be the number of divisors of m. Then d_(t-1) is <= n/3 and so any sum of 3 divisors of at most d_(t-1) is at most n and so that sum is counted per A093035. A sum of 3 divisors of m where one of the divisors is d_t = m as more than m so not counted. This gives (t-1)^3 possible triples hence all terms are cubes.
%F A335018 a(n) = A093035(A147516(n)).
%F A335018 a(n) = A000005(A147516(n) - 1)^3.
%e A335018 A147516(6) = 45 so a(6) = A093035(45) = (tau(45) - 1)^3.
%Y A335018 Cf. A000005, A093035, A147516.
