%N A335984 Numbers m such that more than half the distinct positive terms of the sequence -k^2 + m*k - 1 are primes.
%C A335984 Numbers m such that more than half the distinct terms in row m-2 of the triangular array A059036 are prime.
%C A335984 All positive terms of the sequence are prime for m = 1, 2, 4, 5, 9 and 21.
%C A335984 There are no more terms below 200000. - _Pontus von Brömssen_, Jul 06 2020
%C A335984 Numbers m such that A109909(m) > m/4. - _Pontus von Brömssen_, May 09 2021
%e A335984 7 is in the sequence because with g(k) = -k^2+7*k-1, the positive terms of the sequence g(k) are 5=g(1), 9=g(2) and 11=g(3), and two out of the three (5 and 9) are prime.
