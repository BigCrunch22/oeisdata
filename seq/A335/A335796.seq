%N A335796 Number of ON cells at n-th generation in the "Ulam-Warburton and Friedkin Replicator" hybrid two-dimensional cellular automaton.
%C A335796 The 2D CA uses the Moore neighborhood (all eight orthogonally and diagonally adjacent cells are in the neighborhood).
%C A335796 Generation follows the following algorithm: If a cell has an even number of ON neighbors and it is currently OFF, stay OFF; otherwise turn ON.
