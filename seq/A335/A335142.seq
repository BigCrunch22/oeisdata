%N A335142 Nonunitary Zumkeller numbers: numbers whose set of nonunitary divisors is nonempty and can be partitioned into two disjoint sets of equal sum.
%C A335142 Apparently, most of the terms are nonunitary abundant (A064597). Term that are nonunitary deficient (A064598) are 54, 150, 270, 294, 378, ...
%e A335142 24 is a term since its set of nonunitary divisors, {2, 4, 6, 12}, can be partitioned into the two disjoint sets, {2, 4, 6} and {12}, whose sum is equal: 2 + 4 + 6 = 12.
