%N A335600 The poor sandwiches sequence (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A335600 Imagine we would have a pair of adjacent integers in the sequence like [1951, 2020]. The sandwich would then be made of the rightmost digit of a(n), the leftmost digit of a(n+1) and, in between, the absolute difference of those two digits. The pair [1951, 2020] would then produce the (poor) sandwich 112. (Why poor? Because a rich sandwich would insert the sum of the digits instead of their absolute difference - that is 132 in this example). Please note that the pair [2020, 1951] would produce the poor and genuine sandwich 011 (we keep the leading zero: these are sandwiches after all, not integers).
%C A335600 Now we want the sequence to be the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms such that the successive sandwiches emerging from the sequence rebuild it, digit after digit.

%e A335600 The first successive sandwiches are: 211, 101, 011, 011, 101, 033,...
%e A335600 The first one (211) is visible between a(1) = 2 and a(2) = 1; we get the sandwich by inserting the difference 1 between 2 and 1.
%e A335600 The second sandwich (101) is visible between a(2) = 1 and a(3) = 110; we get this sandwich by inserting the difference 0 between 1 and 1.
%e A335600 The third sandwich (011) is visible between a(3) = 110 and a(4) = 10; we get this sandwich by inserting the difference 1 between 0 and 1; etc.
%e A335600 The successive sandwiches rebuild, digit by digit, the starting sequence.
