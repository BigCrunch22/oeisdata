%N A335214 Divide the biggest term of the pair [a(n), a(n+1)] by the smallest one and keep the remainder; the successive remainders of the successive pairs rebuild the starting sequence, digit after digit. This is the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms with this property.
%C A335214 This is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A335214 One might enter the successive remainders as the sequence T, which would start with 1, 0, 3, 6, 9, 1, 5, 2, 4, 2, 3, 1, 8, 8, 1, 2, 5, 1, 3, 14, 2, 2, 3, 0, 2, 9, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3, 4, 31, 17, 1, 9,... We see that some remainders are > 9.
