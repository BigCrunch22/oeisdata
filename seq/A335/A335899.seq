%N A335899 Squares visited when moving on a square-spiral numbered board to an unvisited diagonally adjacent square containing the spiral number with the fewest divisors. In case of a tie it chooses the square with the lowest spiral number.
%C A335899 The movement on the board in this sequence is restricted to the unvisted diagonally adjacent squares, like a chess bishop but with only one square moves.
%C A335899 The sequence is finite. After 27 steps the square with number 9 is visited, after which all four neighboring squares have been visited.
%C A335899 Due to the paths preference for squares with the fewest divisors it will move to a prime numbered square when possible, and the lowest prime if two or more unvisited primes are in neighboring squares. Of the 27 visited squares 20 contain prime numbers while only 7 contain composites. The largest visited square is a(13) = 251.

%e A335899 a(1) = 1, the starting square of the walk.
%e A335899 a(2) = 3. The four unvisited diagonally adjacent squares around a(1) are numbered 3,5,7,9. Of these 3,5,7 have only two divisors, and 3 is the lowest of those.
%e A335899 a(3) = 11. The three unvisited diagonally adjacent squares around a(2) are numbered 11,13,15. Of these 11 and 13 have only two divisors, and 11 is the lowest of those.
