%N A335861 Number of regions in a Y-shaped polygon with equal arms of length n (see the Comments for definition).
%C A335861 This polygon consists of a central equilateral triangle with a line of n adjacent squares connected to each of its three edges. This gives the polygon a total of one triangle, 3n squares, and 6n+3 vertices. Join every pair of vertices by a line segment, provided the line does not extend beyond the boundary of the polygon. The sequence gives the number of regions in the resulting figure.

%e A335861 a(0) = 1. There is one region in an equilateral triangle with no other polygons.
%e A335861 a(1) = 70. With one square adjacent to each of the triangles sides the resulting line segments form 48 triangles, twelves 4-gons, nine 5-gons, and one 6-gon. This gives a total of 70 regions. See the first linked image.
%Y A335861 Cf. A337790 (number of vertices), A331456, A331452, A306302, A092867, A007678.
