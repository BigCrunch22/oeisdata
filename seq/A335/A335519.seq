%N A335519 Number of contiguous divisors of n.
%C A335519 A divisor of n is contiguous if its prime factors, counting multiplicity, are a contiguous subsequence of the prime factors of n. Explicitly, a divisor d|n is contiguous if n can be written as n = x * d * y where the least prime factor of d is at least the greatest prime factor of x, and the greatest prime factor of d is at most the least prime factor of y.
