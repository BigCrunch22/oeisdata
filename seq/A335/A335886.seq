%N A335886 The heavy sandwiches sequence (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A335886 Imagine we would have a pair of adjacent integers in the sequence like [1951, 2020]. The sandwich would then be made of the rightmost digit of a(n), the leftmost digit of a(n+1) and, in between, the product of those two digits. The pair [1951, 2020] would then produce the sandwich 122. Please note that the pair [2020, 1951] would produce the genuine sandwich 001 (we keep the leading zeros: these are sandwiches after all, not integers).
%C A335886 Now we want the sequence to be the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms such that the successive sandwiches emerging from the sequence rebuild it, digit after digit.

%e A335886 The first successive sandwiches are: 122, 242, 284, 482, 8324, ...
%e A335886 The first one (122) is visible between a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 2; we get the sandwich by inserting the product 2 between 1 and 2.
%e A335886 The second sandwich (242) is visible between a(2) = 2 and a(3) = 22; we get this sandwich by inserting the product 4 between 2 and 2.
%e A335886 The third sandwich (284) is visible between a(3) = 22 and a(4) = 4; we get this sandwich by inserting the product 8 between 2 and 4.
%e A335886 The fourth sandwich (482) is visible between a(4) = 4 and a(5) = 228; we get this sandwich by inserting the product 8 between 4 and 2.
%e A335886 The fifth sandwich (8324) is visible between a(5) = 228 and a(6) = 44; we get this sandwich by inserting the product 32 between 8 and 4; etc.
%e A335886 The successive sandwiches rebuild, digit by digit, the starting sequence.
%Y A335886 Cf. A335600 (the "poor" sandwich sequence).
