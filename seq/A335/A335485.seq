%N A335485 Numbers k such that the k-th composition in standard order (A066099) is not weakly decreasing.
%C A335485 Also compositions matching the pattern (1,2).
%C A335485 A composition of n is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to n. The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
