%N A335472 Number of compositions of n matching the pattern (2,1,2).
%C A335472 Also the number of (1,2,2) or (2,2,1)-matching compositions.
%C A335472 We define a pattern to be a finite sequence covering an initial interval of positive integers. Patterns are counted by A000670 and ranked by A333217. A sequence S is said to match a pattern P if there is a not necessarily contiguous subsequence of S whose parts have the same relative order as P. For example, (3,1,1,3) matches (1,1,2), (2,1,1), and (2,1,2), but avoids (1,2,1), (1,2,2), and (2,2,1).
%C A335472 A composition of n is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to n.
