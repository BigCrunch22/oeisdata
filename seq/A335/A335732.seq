%N A335732 Emirps whose concatenation of adjacent digit differences either form an emirp that also has this characteristic or form a single-digit prime, and whose emirp also has this characteristic.
%e A335732 7481 is in the list as the concatenation of adjacent digit differences forms an emirp (i.e., |7-4|=3; |4-8|=4; |8-1|=7; which form 347, which is an emirp as 743 is also prime). Furthermore, for 347, |3-4|=1; |4-7|=3; forms 13, which is an emirp as 31 is also prime. Finally, |1-3| = 2, which is prime. This characteristic is also true for the emirp of 7481 which is 1847 (i.e., 1847 forms 743 which forms 31 which finally forms 2).
