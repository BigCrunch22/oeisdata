%N A335992 Numbers that are the average of more pairs of distinct twin primes than any previous number.
%C A335992 Let T(n) be the number of pairs of twin primes (that is, primes p where p+2 or p-2 is also prime) with average n.  These are the positions at which T(n) attains high-water marks.
%H A335992 N. J. A. Sloane, <a href="/transforms.txt">Transforms</a> (The RECORDS transform returns both the high-water marks and the places where they occur).
%e A335992 1 is not the average of any pairs of twin primes.  4 is the average of one pair of twin primes: 3 and 5.  8 is the average of two pairs of twin primes: 5 and 11, and 3 and 13.  (Note that the difference between the twin primes in each pair is not necessarily 2.  However, both members of the pair are twin primes, that is, prime numbers p such that either p+2 or p-2 is also prime.  The fact that their twins are not part of the pair doesn't matter.)
