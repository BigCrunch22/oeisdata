%N A335916 Isolated primes in the hexagonal spiral of the nonnegative integers.
%C A335916 Plotting the integers on a hexagonal grid as in A001399 associates each n>=0 with six different neighbors to the E, NE, NW, W, SE and SW. If n is prime and all 6 neighbors are composite, n is in the sequence.
%e A335916 The six neighbors of the prime 7 are 1, 6, 8, 18, 19, 20; 19 is also prime, so 7 is not in the sequence.
%e A335916 The six neighbors of the prime 83 are 54, 55, 82, 84, 117 and 118 which are all composite, so 83 is in the sequence.
%p A335916 # replace isA001358 by isprime in the coding for A113653, and isA113653 by isA335916.
%Y A335916 Cf. A001399, A113653 (isolated semiprimes).
