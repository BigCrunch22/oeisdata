%N A335744 Insert a dot after the first digit of a(n); this is now the beginning of the arithmetic mean of the digits used so far in the sequence. Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms with this property.
%C A335744 The sequence starts with a(1) = 45 as any a(1) < 45 would not produce an infinite sequence.
%e A335744 a(1) = 45; inserting a dot between the first two digits produces 4.5; this is now the arithmetic mean (AM) of the digits used so far in the sequence as (4 + 5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5 (and 4.5 is 45 with a dot);
%e A335744 a(2) = 30; inserting a dot between the first two digits produces 3.0; this is the AM of the digits used so far in the sequence as (4 + 5 + 3 + 0)/4 = 12/4 = 3 (and 3 is 30 with a dot);
%e A335744 a(3) = 38; inserting a dot between the first two digits produces 3.8; this is the beginning of the AM of the digits used so far as (4 + 5 + 3 + 0 + 3 + 8)/6 = 23/6 = 3.83333...
%e A335744 a(4) = 311; inserting a dot between the first two digits produces 3.11; this is the beginning of the AM of the digits used so far as (4 + 5 + 3 + 0 + 3 + 8 + 3 + 1 + 1)/9 = 28/9 = 3.111... [a(4)is not 31 as the AM would then be 3,375; a(4) is not 3111 as 311 comes lexicographically before 3111];
%Y A335744 Cf. A335743 (same idea, but the AM is given by the first two digits of a(n), separated by a dot).
