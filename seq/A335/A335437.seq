%N A335437 Numbers k with a partition into two distinct parts (s,t) such that k | s*t.
%C A335437 All values of this sequence are nonsquarefree (A013929).
%C A335437 From _Peter Munn_, Nov 23 2020: (Start)
%C A335437 Numbers whose square part is greater than 4. [Proof follows from s and t having to be multiples of A019554(k), the smallest number whose square is divisible by k.]
%C A335437 Compare with A116451, numbers whose odd part is greater than 3. The self-inverse function A225546(.) maps the members of either one of these sets 1:1 onto the other set.
%C A335437 Compare with A028983, numbers whose squarefree part is greater than 2.

%C A335437 The asymptotic density of this sequence is 1 - 15/(2*Pi^2). - _Amiram Eldar_, Mar 08 2021
%C A335437 From _Bernard Schott_, Jan 09 2022: (Start)
%C A335437 Numbers of the form u*m^2, for u >= 1 and m >= 3 (union of first 2 comments).
%C A335437 A geometric application: in trapezoid ABCD, with AB // CD, the diagonals intersect at E. If the area of triangle ABE is u and the area of triangle CDE is v, with u>v, then the area of trapezoid ABCD is w = u + v + 2*sqrt(u*v); in this case, u, v, w are integer solutions iff (u,v,w) = (k*s^2,k*t^2,k*(s+t)^2), with s>t and k positives; hence, w is a term of this sequence (see IMTS link).
