%N A335307 The number of hanging vertically stable self-avoiding walks of length n on a 2D square lattice where only the nodes have mass.
%C A335307 This is a variation of A335780 where only the nodes have mass. See that sequence for further details of the allowed walks.
%e A335307 a(1)-a(4) = 1 as the only stable walk is a walk straight down from the first node.
%e A335307 a(5) = 5. There are two stable walks with a first step to the right:
%e A335307 .

%e A335307 +
%e A335307 .
%e A335307 Assuming a node mass of p, both walks have a torque of 2p to the right and 2p to the left of the first node. These walks can be taken in 2 ways. Thus, with the straight down walk, the total number of stable walks is 2*2+1 = 5.
%Y A335307 Cf. A335780 (rods and nodes have mass), A335596 (only rods have mass), A116903, A337761, A001411, A001412.
