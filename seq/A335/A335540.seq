%N A335540 Numbers with a record number of abundant divisors.
%C A335540 The corresponding numbers of abundant divisors are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, 18, 19, 23, ...
%C A335540 All the terms > 1 are abundant numbers (A005101) and all the terms > 12 are not primitive abundant numbers (A091191).
%C A335540 Apparently, all the terms are least numbers of their prime signature (A025487). This was verified for the first 100 terms.
