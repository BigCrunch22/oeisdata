%N A335354 a(n) is the number of edges in the central polygon formed in a square by dividing each of its sides into n equal parts giving a total of 4*n nodes and drawing straight line segments from node k to node (k+n+1) mod 4*n, 0 <= k < 4*n.
%C A335354 For n=1 there is no central polygon.
%C A335354 The number of edges of the central polygon tends to grow as n increases, whereas for n = 16..500 the polygon with next-to-most edges has 8 of them.
%C A335354 See A335350 for illustrations.
