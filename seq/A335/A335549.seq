%N A335549 Number of normal patterns matched by the multiset of prime indices of n in weakly increasing order.
%C A335549 First differs from A181796 at a(90) = 8 A181796(90) = 7.
%C A335549 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798.
%C A335549 We define a (normal) pattern to be a finite sequence covering an initial interval of positive integers. Patterns are counted by A000670 and ranked by A333217. A sequence S is said to match a pattern P if there is a not necessarily contiguous subsequence of S whose parts have the same relative order as P. For example, (3,1,1,3) matches (1,1,2), (2,1,1), and (2,1,2), but avoids (1,2,1), (1,2,2), and (2,2,1).
