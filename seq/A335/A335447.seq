%N A335447 Number of (1,2)-matching permutations of the prime indices of n.
%C A335447 Depends only on sorted prime signature (A118914).
%C A335447 Also the number of (2,1)-matching permutations of the prime indices of n.
%C A335447 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798.
%C A335447 We define a pattern to be a finite sequence covering an initial interval of positive integers. Patterns are counted by A000670. A sequence S is said to match a pattern P if there is a not necessarily contiguous subsequence of S whose parts have the same relative order as P. For example, (3,1,1,3) matches (1,1,2), (2,1,1), and (2,1,2), but avoids (1,2,1), (1,2,2), and (2,2,1).
