%N A335663 For n >= 1,  a(n) = f(n) where f is a bijection on Z such that f(x)-x is also a bijection on Z and f(f(x)) = x.
%C A335663 This appears in the problem of finding a bijection f on Z such that f(x)-x is also a bijection on Z. a(n) is the value on the natural numbers of an f satisfying the above condition as well as f(f(n)) = n. It is interesting to note that all a(n) such that a(n) > n are precisely A184119 (empirical) and ones satisfying a(n) <= n are precisely A136119 (empirical).
%F A335663 a(1) = 2 and for all i > 1 we define a(i) as follows:
%F A335663 Rule 1 : a(i) = j if there is some j such that j < i and a(j) = i.
%F A335663 Rule 2 : If Rule 1 cannot be performed then a(i) = i+2n+3 , if this rule applied n times previously.
%e A335663 We begin with a(1) = 2.
%e A335663 To calculate a(2): we first check if 2 has appeared in this sequence before. Indeed since a(1) = 2 we set a(2) = 1.
%e A335663 For a(3): observe that 3 has not appeared before so we can't apply Rule 1. Since we have performed rule 2 zero times before, therefore, a(3) = 3+2(0)+3 = 6.
%e A335663 For a(4): we cannot apply Rule 1 as 4 has not appeared before. We have applied Rule 2 one time before and hence a(4) = 4+2(1)+3 = 9.
%e A335663 Similarly a(5) = 5+2(2)+3 = 12.
%e A335663 However for a(6) we see a(3) = 6 and hence due to Rule 1, we must set a(6) = 3.
