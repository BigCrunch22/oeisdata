%N A335790 Triangle read by rows of possible absolute values of alternating sums when traveling around a tree with n edges, with each node labeled with the number of edges connected to it, until each edge has been visited twice.
%C A335790 Begin and end on the same node, but do not include the ending step in the sum.
%C A335790 Two isomorphic trees will always have the same alternating sum, because flipping branches around will always switch two odd-length sequences separated by another odd-length sequence (the reverse is NOT true in general - flipping sequences around is not even guaranteed to create a tree).
%C A335790 Trees which are symmetric around an edge will have alternating sum 0, because the same numbers appear on either side of that edge.
%C A335790 Two graphs can have the same alternating sum, and the same sum, and still not be isomorphic.
%e A335790 For the tree of length 2, 1-2+1-2 = -2. The tree is described by [1,2,1,2].
