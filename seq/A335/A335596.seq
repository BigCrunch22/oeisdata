%N A335596 The number of hanging vertically stable self-avoiding walks of length n on a 2D square lattice where only the connecting rods have mass.
%C A335596 This is a variation of A335780 where only the rods between the nodes have mass. See that sequence for further details of the allowed walks.
%e A335596 a(1)-a(4) = 1 as the only stable walk is a walk straight down from the first node.
%e A335596 a(5) = 3. There is one stable walk with a first step to the right:

%e A335596 Assuming a rod mass of q, the total torque to the right of the first node is 2*q*(1/2) + 1*q*1 = 2q. The total torque to the left of the first node is 1*q*(1/2) + 1*q*(3/2) = 2q. This walk can be taken in 2 ways. Thus, with the straight down walk, the total number of stable walks is 2+1 = 3.
