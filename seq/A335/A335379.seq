%N A335379 a(n) is the number of Mersenne prime (irreducible) polynomials M = x^k(x+1)^(n-k)+1 of degree n in GF(2)[x] (k goes from 1 to n-1) such that Phi_7(M) has an odd number of prime divisors (omega(Phi_7(M)) is odd).
%C A335379 Phi_7(x)=1+x+x^2+x^3+x^4+x^5+x^6, is the 7th cyclotomic polynomial; omega(P(x)) counts the 2 X 2 distinct irreducible divisors of the binary polynomial P(x) in GF(2)[x].
%C A335379 It is surprising that a(n) be so small (conjecturally it is always 1 or 2). The sequence appeared when working the special case p=7 of a conjecture (see Links) about prime divisors in GF(2)[x] of the composed cyclotomic polynomial Phi_p(M), where p is a prime number and M is a Mersenne irreducible polynomial.

%e A335379 For n=4 a(4)= 0 (the sequence begins a(2)=1,a(3)=2,...), since there is no Mersenne polynomial M of degree 4 in GF(2)[x] such that omega(Phi_7(M)) is odd.
