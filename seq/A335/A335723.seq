%N A335723 Perfect powers whose totients are factorials.
%C A335723 Corresponding values of factorials are 1!, 2!, 3!, 5!, 7!, 8!, 9!, 11! and 13!, respectively.
%C A335723 This sequence is complete by Saunders, Theorem 1.
%C A335723 All integers in this sequence are square. Hence, there exists no m-th power with m >= 3 whose totient is a factorial except 1.
%C A335723 More generally, Saunders, Theorem 1 states that, for any positive integers a, b, c, m with gcd(b, c) = 1, there are only finitely many solutions to phi(ax^m) = b*n!/c and these solutions satisfy n <= max {61, 3a, 3b, 3c}.
