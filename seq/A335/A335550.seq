%N A335550 Number of minimal normal patterns avoided by the prime indices of n in increasing or decreasing order, counting multiplicity.
%C A335550 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798.
%C A335550 We define a (normal) pattern to be a finite sequence covering an initial interval of positive integers. Patterns are counted by A000670 and ranked by A333217. A sequence S is said to match a pattern P if there is a not necessarily contiguous subsequence of S whose parts have the same relative order as P. For example, (3,1,1,3) matches (1,1,2), (2,1,1), and (2,1,2), but avoids (1,2,1), (1,2,2), and (2,2,1).

%F A335550 It appears that for n > 1, a(n) = 3 if n is a power of a squarefree number (A072774), and a(n) = 4 otherwise.
%e A335550 The a(12) = 4 minimal patterns avoiding (1,1,2) are: (2,1), (1,1,1), (1,2,2), (1,2,3).
%e A335550 The a(30) = 3 minimal patterns avoiding (1,2,3) are: (1,1), (2,1), (1,2,3,4).
