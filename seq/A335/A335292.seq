%N A335292 To calculate a(n), iterate the function f(x) = x * ceiling(a(n-1) / 2) + 1 on the value x = 1 until the result has not appeared in the sequence previously. Take a(1) = 1.
%C A335292 By definition, this sequence never repeats its values.

%e A335292 a(6) = 4. Therefore, ceiling(a(6) / 2) is equal to 2, and a(7) should be 1 * 2 + 1 = 3. However, since 3 can already be found in the sequence (coincidentally, at position n = 3), one must iterate the function again to get a(7) = 3 * 2 + 1 = 7. But 7 is also already in the sequence (at position n = 4), so the function must be iterated once more to find that a(7) is indeed equal to 7 * 2 + 1 = 15.
