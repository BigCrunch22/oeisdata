%N A335029 Numbers that are not practical (A237287) and have more divisors than any smaller number that is not practical.
%C A335029 The corresponding numbers of divisors are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24, 32, 36, 40, 48, 54, 64, 72, 80, 96, 108, 120, 128, 144, 160, 192, 216, 240, 256, 288, 320, 384, 432, 480, 512, ...
%C A335029 Of the first 39 terms, 34 terms are also in A038547.
%C A335029 None of the terms are highly composite (A002182) since all the highly composite numbers are practical numbers (A005153).
%e A335029 The first 5 numbers that are not practical are 3, 5, 7, 9, 10. Their numbers of divisors are 2, 2, 2, 3, 4. The record numbers of divisors are 2, 3 and 4 which occur at 3, 9 and 10.
