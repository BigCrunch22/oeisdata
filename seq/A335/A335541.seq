%N A335541 Numbers with a record value of the ratio of the number of abundant divisors to the total number of divisors.
%C A335541 Apparently, all the terms are least numbers of their prime signature (A025487). This was verified for the first 78 terms.
%C A335541 The ratio A080224(m)/A000005(m) can be arbitrarily close to 1. For example, A080224(6^k)/A000005(6^k) = (k-1)/(k+1) = 1 - 2/(k+1), for k >= 1.

%F A335541 Numbers m such that A080224(m)/A000005(m) > A080224(k)/A000005(k) for all k < m.
%e A335541 36 has 9 divisors, {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36}, 3 of which are abundant, {12, 18, 36}. The ratio 3/9 = 1/3 is larger than the ratios for all the numbers below 36. Hence 36 is a term.
