%N A335476 Numbers k such that the k-th composition in standard order (A066099) matches the pattern (1,1,2).
%C A335476 A composition of n is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to n. The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%C A335476 We define a pattern to be a finite sequence covering an initial interval of positive integers. Patterns are counted by A000670 and ranked by A333217. A sequence S is said to match a pattern P if there is a not necessarily contiguous subsequence of S whose parts have the same relative order as P. For example, (3,1,1,3) matches (1,1,2), (2,1,1), and (2,1,2), but avoids (1,2,1), (1,2,2), and (2,2,1).
