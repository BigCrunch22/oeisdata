%N A335753 Maximal length of the shortest walk on any n X n maze that starts in one corner and visits the other three corners.
%C A335753 The maze is a 4-connected n X n grid consisting of empty cells and walls. The walk can visit adjacent empty cells, but cannot go through walls. Every corner must be reachable; i.e., cannot contain a wall. The walk can revisit cells.
%C A335753 a(14) >= 196, which makes n=14 the smallest known n such that a(n) >= n*n.
%C A335753 Daniel Mathias conjectures that a(n) cannot exceed 10*n*n/9.
