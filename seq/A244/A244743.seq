%N A244743 Smallest number n with ||n-1||-||n|| = k where ||n||=A005245(n) denotes the complexity of n.
%C A244743 The k-th term of this sequence is the least n with ||n-1||-||n|| = k if such an n exists.
%C A244743 It is conjectured that ||n-1||-||n|| is not bounded. But there is no proof that the sequence is infinite or is well defined.

%e A244743 ||719||=23, ||720||=19, therefore ||719||-||720||=4. This is the first time the difference 4 appears in this way. Hence a(4)=720.
