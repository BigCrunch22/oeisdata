%N A244063 Number of prime factors (with multiplicity) of the number of distinct prime factors of n; a(n) = Omega(omega(n)).
%C A244063 This sequence is not the same as A143731 and first departs from it when n = 210. The characteristic function A143731(210)=1, while a(210)=2. This is because 210 is the smallest number with 4 distinct prime factors (210 = 2*3*5*7) and 4 is the smallest composite number. Thus, Omega(omega(210)) = Omega(4) = 2.
%C A244063 The records for this sequence are at 2, 6, 210, 9699690, 32589158477190044730, ..., the products of the first 2^n primes. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Sep 14 2015
