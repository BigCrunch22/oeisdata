%N A244233 Product of "digit values" in Semigreedy Catalan Representation of n, A244159.
%C A244233 Note that a(33604) = 10! = 3628800 because the product is computed from the underlying list (vector) of numbers, and thus is not subject to any corruption by decimal representation as A244159 itself is.
