%N A244951 Minimum number of colors needed to color the faces of the Platonic solids such that no two faces meeting at a common edge share the same color (in the order tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron).

%e A244951 a(1) = 4, since in the tetrahedron any face shares a common edge with any other face, so each face needs a distinct color.
%e A244951 a(2) = 3, since the cube has three sets of opposite faces. Any two faces that are not opposite share a common edge, so only opposite faces can have the same color.
%e A244951 a(3) = 2, since cutting the octahedron along its "equator" results in two square pyramids. The triangular faces of a single pyramid can be colored using two colors in an alternating fashion. Then the two pyramids are reassembled such that at the "equator" differently colored faces meet.
%e A244951 a(4) and a(5) are shown in illustration in the links.
