%N A244032 Positive numbers n such that there exists a positive number m != n such that x^2+ny^2 and x^2+my^2 represent the same odd primes.
%C A244032 There are no other terms for which both n and m are < 100000.

%e A244032 For example, 9 and 12 are members because the odd primes (in fact all the primes) represented by x^2+9y^2 and x^2+12y^2 are the same - see A068228.
