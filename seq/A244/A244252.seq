%N A244252 Total number of incoming edges at depth n in the solid partitions graph.
%C A244252 The solid partition graph is constructed as a directed graph whose vertices are solid partitions. The root vertex of the graph is the unique solid partition with one node. Given a solid partition, draw on outward directed edge to all solid partitions that can be obtained by the addition of a single node to the solid partition. The depth of a given vertex is given by the number of its nodes.

%e A244252 a(2) = 4 as all four solid partitions of 2 are connected to the root vertex.
