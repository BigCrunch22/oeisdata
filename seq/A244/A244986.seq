%N A244986 a(n) = Position of 2^n among the numbers which are divisible by the square of their highest noncomposite factor (i.e., the union of {1} and A070003), 0 if not there.
%F A244986 For all n >= 1, a(n+1) = A244984(A006254(n)).
%e A244986 2 is not divisible by 2^2, thus a(2) = 0, the only zero in the sequence.
%e A244986 2^4 = 16 is the fifth term in [1, 4, 8, 9, 16, 18, 25, 27, 32, 36, ...] (the union of {1} and A070003), thus a(4) = 5.
%e A244986 2^5 = 32 is the ninth term in the same list, thus a(5) = 9.
%Y A244986 From a(2) onward one more than A244985.
