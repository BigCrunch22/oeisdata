%N A244591 Zero followed by the terms of A032924 arranged to give the unique path to the n-th node of a complete, rooted and ordered binary tree.
%C A244591 There is no path to the root node so first node path is 0. All other paths are represented by the terms of A032924 that are base 3 numbers containing no zeros. Starting at the lowest order digit base 3, if this is 1 then the path from the root node to a lower level node is to the left, otherwise it is to the right. Each successive digit order defines the next path to be taken until the highest digit order is reached and the specified node found.

%e A244591 a(11)=25, so the path to node 11 is given by 25 which when represented as a base 3 number gives 221. Hence the path to the 11th node from the root node is Left, Right, Right.
