%N A244054 Decimal expansion of the maximal circumradius of a planar convex set containing no lattice point except for the origin where it has its circumcenter, and not protruding in opposite directions outside the square max(|x|,|y|) < 1 unless it protrudes significantly elsewhere, too.
%C A244054 From _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 23 2020: (Start)
%C A244054 Without the additional technical condition, the circumradius would be infinite as can be seen by taking a very long lozenge centered at the origin and thin enough to avoid all other lattice points. (Or say, the convex hull of { +-(1/2, H); +-(1/4H, 0) } as H -> oo.)
%C A244054 With these conditions, the maximizing convex set is an almost isosceles triangle having, e.g., (-1,-1) very near the midpoint of its base and the point (1,1) on one of its legs near the opposite vertex. (End)
