%N A244196 Cumulative angle at the center of successive numbered sectors of a standard competition dartboard, with numbers traversed in order.
%C A244196 A standard dartboard is divided into 20 sectors each subtending an angle of 18 degrees.
%C A244196 The sequence is generated by considering the positive X-axis to be running through the center of the sector numbered "6" and defining this to be 0 degrees. A line collinear with X is then rotated clockwise until each numbered sector is traversed through the center of the sector in question. The total number of degrees is summed as each sector is traversed.
