%N A244424 Least number k > 0 such that concatenating k consecutive natural numbers beginning with n is prime, or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A244424 The current zero values are only conjectural: a(n) > 5000 - n for all a(n) = 0 shown. [Edited by _M. F. Hasler_, Apr 27 2017]
%C A244424 A positive value for a(1) will satisfy A075019(a(1)) = A007908(a(1)). - _Michel Marcus_, Jul 09 2014
%C A244424 Probably a(n) > 0 for all n. Appending k integers gives a number of size ~10^(k log_10 k) and so the expected number of primes with k < x is about the integral of 1/(k log k) up to x which is log log x. This diverges, so by the Borel-Cantelli lemma we expect that there will be a prime eventually. (Corrections for the particular base at hand affect the expected number but not its order of growth.) On the other hand, log log x grows slowly so finding the values of a(1), a(10), a(21), etc. may be hard. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jul 10 2014 [Corrected by _Pontus von BrÃ¶mssen_, Oct 12 2021]
%e A244424 14 is not prime. 1415 is not prime. 141516 is not prime. 14151617 is prime. Thus a(14) = 4 since 4 consecutive numbers were concatenated.
