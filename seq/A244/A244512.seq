%N A244512 The angle of the center of each numbered sector of a standard competition dartboard.
%C A244512 A standard dartboard is divided into 20 sectors each subtending an angle of 18 degrees.
%C A244512 The sequence is generated by considering the positive x-axis to be running through the center of the sector numbered "6" and defining this to be 0 degrees. The angular position of each sector is then defined relative to this position through a clockwise rotation of a line collinear with x until the line divides the sector of interest. The numbers are then sectors are ordered from 1 to 20 generating the full sequence.
%C A244512 It is a mere formality to fully define the bounds of each sector by adding and subtracting 9 degrees from each of the numbers in the sequence.
