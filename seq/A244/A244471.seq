%N A244471 Lexicographically earliest sequence of integers with property that if a vertical line is drawn between any pair of adjacent digits, the number Z formed by the digits to the left of the line is divisible by the digit to the right of the line.
%C A244471 "Lexicographically earliest" means in the sense of a sequence of integers, not digits.
%C A244471 No digit can be even or five. - _Hans Havermann_, Jul 02 2014 [Proof: if not, let d be the first digit in the sequence that is even or 5, and let Z be the concatenation of all earlier digits. But then Z is odd and does not end in 5, so is not divisible by d. Contradiction. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jul 03 2014] So any term must have only the odd digits {1, 3, 7, 9} (see A136333). - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Jul 02 2014
%C A244471 We choose the next term, a(n), to be the minimal number not already in the sequence such that the property "if a vertical line is drawn between any pair of adjacent digits, the number Z formed by the digits to the left of the line is divisible by the first digit following Z" holds.
%C A244471 So even if Z is prime, the next term can start with a 1.
%C A244471 So if Z is divisible by any d in {2,3,...,9} the next term can start with 1 or d, otherwise it must start with 1.
%C A244471 This sequence is missing A136333 terms 313, 319, 373, 379, 717, 737, 797, 913, 919, 939, 973, 979, 1313, ... The earliest occurrences of n-digit numbers are the repunits at indices 1, 2, 7, 15, 27, 97, 372, 939, 2164, 4781, 10851, 22779, 47056, ... The latest n-digit numbers and their indices are: (9,17), (17,52), (397,290), (1917,867), (19317,2003), (199117,7241), (1999117,17953), (19999997,44173), ... - _Hans Havermann_, Jul 04 2014, Jul 07 2014, Jul 15 2014

%e A244471 After 1,11,3,7, let a(5) = x be the next term. Now 11137 = 7*37*43, so x must begin with 1 or 7. The candidates for x are therefore 12,13,...,19,71,72,,...,79,111,...
%e A244471 If x=12, we would get 1 11 3 7 12 ... but Z = 11371 is prime and is not divisible by 2, ..., 9. So x is not 12, ...,19. The next candidate is x=71, and this works. So a(5)=71.
