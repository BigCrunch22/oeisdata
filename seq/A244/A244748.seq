%N A244748 Numbers k such that (product of digits of k)^2 + 1 is prime.
%C A244748 A number k is a term of this sequence iff A007954(k)^2 is in A006093.
%C A244748 This sequence is infinite. With any number a(n), you can add infinitely many 1's to its decimal representation. E.g., 85 is in this sequence, so 185, 815, 851, 1185, 1815, 18115, etc. are terms as well.

%e A244748 (7*2)^2 + 1 = 197 is prime. Thus 72 is a term of this sequence.
