%N A244268 Numbers n such that 1n2n3n4n5n6n7n8n9 is prime.
%C A244268 There are no numbers between 10^4 and 10^5. When n is five digits, 1n2n3n4n5n6n7n8n9 is divisible by 17.
%C A244268 Proof: First, 10000020000030000040000050000060000070000008000009 is divisible by 17. Thus we only need to consider 0n0n0n0n0n0n0n0n0 and see if it's divisible by 17. If it is, n0n0n0n0n0n0n0n must be. If n is five digits long, let n = 00001. We see that when n = 00001, n0n0n0n0n0n0n0n is divisible by 17. Since any five-digit number is a multiple of n (and has exactly 5 digits), all five-digit numbers will share the same property.
%C A244268 In general, for x = 0, 1, 2, ... if n is 16*x+5 digits long, then 1n2n3n4n5n6n7n8n9 is divisible by 17.
%e A244268 1.10.2.10.3.10.4.10.5.10.6.10.7.10.8.10.9 = 1102103104105106107108109 is prime. Thus 10 is a member of this sequence.
