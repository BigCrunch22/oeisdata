%N A376996 Number of odd terms in the Collatz trajectory of n which are > n and are a new record high among its odd terms.
%C A376996 Similar to A334040, but only count when it comes to a new larger odd number.
%e A376996 For n=15, a 4k-1 term, its trajectory is 15, 46, (23), 70, (35), 106, (53), 160, 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 1. The numbers in the parentheses are numbers which make larger odd numbers. There are 3 of them, so a(15) = 3.
%e A376996 For n=9, a 4k+1 term, its trajectory is 9, 28, 14, 7, 22, (11), 34, (17), 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. There are 2 new largest odd terms, so a(9) = 2. It is noticeable that before the first new largest odd term 11, it reaches 7, which is a 4k-1 term smaller than 9, so a(9) = a(7).
%e A376996 For n=10, a 2k term, its trajectory is 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. There are no odd terms > 10, so a(10) = 0.
