%N A376243 Nonnegative integers N = x*y*z = x+y+z for some rational x, y, z.
%C A376243 Obviously all of x, y and z must be nonzero for all solutions N > 0. For any N = x*y*z = x+y+z, one gets -N from (-x, -y, -z), so considering only N >= 0 is not a restriction. Either none or exactly two among x, y and z must be negative.
%C A376243 For given N, the problem amounts to finding fractions x and y such that x*y^2 + x*(x - N)*y + N = 0, which in turn corresponds to finding rational points on the elliptic curve Y^2 = X^3 + N^2*(X+4)^2 (with X = -4*N/x and Y = 4*N*D/x^2, where D^2 is the discriminant of the previous quadratic in y).
%C A376243 It appears that (for N > 0) we have a rational solution iff this elliptic curve has nonzero rank. (Is there any counter-example?) If so, the sequence goes (0, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 37, 38, 40, 43, 44, 45, 46, 48, 49, 52, 53, 55, 56, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 82, 83, 84, 86, 87, ...)
