%N A376181 Array read by antidiagonals: Start from 1 and thereafter add gnomons of terms for each t >= 2 with width a(t-1).
%C A376181 A gnomon is an L-shaped group of terms that are equal to each other and surrounds the top-left corner.
%C A376181 The sequence seems to oscillate a lot and it seems that log(a(n))/log(n) doesn't converge. However, log(max{a(i); i < n})/log(n) appears to converge to around ~0.387.
%C A376181 The formula a(d(d+1)/2) = n, where d = 1 + (a(1) + ... + a(n-1)), suggests that the sequence might be growing like k*n^c on average, where c = (sqrt(3)-1)/2.
%C A376181 The construction is similar to the Golomb sequence (A001462) in that sequence terms themselves determine repetitions, but here those repetitions are gnomon widths.
%F A376181 a(d(d+1)/2) = n, where d = 1 + (a(1) + ... + a(n-1)), for n > 1.
%F A376181 a(n) ~ k*n^c, on average, where c = (sqrt(3)-1)/2 = 0.366... (heuristic).
%F A376181 max{a(i); i < n} ~ K*n^e with e ~ 0.387...  (empirical).
