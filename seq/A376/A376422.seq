%N A376422 Numbers m with largest nondivisor k <= m such that rad(k) | m is not powerful, where rad = A007497.
%C A376422 The term powerful used here refers to k in A001694, and rad = A007947.
%C A376422 Includes m such that the largest k = A373736(m) in row m of A272618 is not in A001694.
%C A376422 Subset of A024619, since for prime powers m = p^e, e >= 1, all k <= m such that rad(k) | m also divide m.
%C A376422 Subset of A376421, since nondivisor k such that rad(k) | m must be composite, and composite prime powers m in A246547 are a subset of A001694.

%e A376422 6 is not included since nondivisor 4 = 2^2 is such that rad(4) | 6, but 4 is powerful since it is a perfect power of a prime.
%e A376422 24 is included since nondivisor 18 = 2 * 3^2 is such that rad(18) | 24 and is not powerful.
%e A376422 42 is not included since nondivisor 36 = 2^2 * 3^2 is such that rad(36) | 42 but 36 is powerful, since all exponents of prime power factors of 36 exceed 1, i.e., 36 is in A286708, a subset of A001694.
%e A376422 60 is in the sequence because nondivisor 54 = 2 * 3^3 but rad(54) | 60 and 54 is not powerful, etc.
