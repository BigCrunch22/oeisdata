%H A376505 Michael De Vlieger, <a href="https://oeis.org/A376504/a376504.png">Hasse diagram of row 1440 of A162306</a> showing 4 squarefree composites in green, 3 primes in red, the empty product in gray, 17 perfect powers of primes in yellow, and 72 numbers that are neither squarefree nor prime powers in blue and purple, with purple additionally representing powerful numbers that are not prime powers.
%F A376505 a(n) = A010846(n) - (Sum_{p|n} floor(log n / log p)) - 2^omega(n) + omega(n), where omega = A001221.
%F A376505 a(n) = A010846(n) - A361373(n) - A376504(n) + 1.
%F A376505 a(n) = 0 for n = p^k, where p is prime and k >= 0, i.e., n in A000961.
%F A376505 Intersection of A126706 and row n of A162306.
%e A376505 a(2) = a(4) = a(p^k) = 0 since numbers m <= p^k such that rad(m) | p^k are all divisors that are prime powers p^j, j = 0..k.
%e A376505 a(k) = 0 for k < 12 since 12 is the smallest number that is neither squarefree nor prime powers.
%e A376505 a(12) = 1 since m = 12 is such that 12 <= 12 and rad(12) | 12.
%e A376505 a(18) = 2 since both k = 12 and k = 18 are such that rad(k) | 18.
%e A376505 a(30) = 4 since row 30 of A162306 has 4 numbers that are neither squarefree nor prime powers: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, [12], 15, 16, [18], [20], [24], 25, 27, 30}, indicated by brackets. (The bracketed numbers happen to be the first 4 terms of A126706.)
