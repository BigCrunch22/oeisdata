%N A376190 For a line L in the plane, let C(L) denote the number of prime points [k, prime(k)] on L, and let M(l) denote the maximum prime(k) for any of these points; A376187(n) is the minimum M(L) over all lines with C(L) = n, or -1 if there is no such line. If there is at least one such line L, consider the smallest prime in all such lines, then the maximum of these smallest primes is a(n). If no such line exists, a(n) = -1.
%C A376190 Consider all the lines L in the plane containing exactly n prime-points (k, prime(k)). A376187 minimizes the maximal prime on any such line L, while the present sequence then maximizes the minimal prime on the lines from A376187.
%C A376190 In other words, we first minimize (in A376187) the max prime over all lines with exactly n points, and then here we further maximize the minimal prime. The second step minimizes the spread of the points.

%e A376190 The best line with 5 points contains the primes 19,23,31,43,47, so a(5) = 19 and A376187(5) = 47. See the Table for further examples.
