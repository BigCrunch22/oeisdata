%N A376421 Numbers m with largest nondivisor k <= m such that rad(k) | m is not a prime power, where rad = A007947.
%C A376421 The term prime power used here refers to k in A246547.
%C A376421 Includes m such that the largest k = A373736(m) in row m of A272618 is not in A246547.
%C A376421 Subset of A024619, since for prime powers m = p^e, e >= 1, all k <= m such that rad(k) | m also divide m.
%C A376421 Contains A376422, since nondivisor k such that rad(k) | m must be composite, and composite prime powers m in A246547 are a subset of A001694.

%e A376421 6 is not included since nondivisor 4 = 2^2 is such that rad(4) | 6, but 4 is a perfect power of a prime.
%e A376421 24 is included since nondivisor 18 = 2 * 3^2 is such that rad(18) | 24 and is not a prime power.
%e A376421 42 is included since nondivisor 36 = 2^2 * 3^2 is such that rad(36) | 42 and 36 is not a prime power.
%e A376421 60 is in the sequence because nondivisor 54 = 2 * 3^3 but rad(54) | 60 and 54 is not a prime power, etc.
