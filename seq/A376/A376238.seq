%N A376238 Sequence obtained from A376239 by deleting the substrings of k-1 copies of k starting at index k(k-1)/2 + 1 for each k > 1.
%C A376238 In A376239 we conjecture that the sequences S[r+1] = D S[r], starting with S[1] = A376239, will have the property P(r) for all r >= 1. Here D means to delete the subsequences of k repeated k-1 times, starting at index (k-1)r + T(k-2) + 1, for all k > 1. The property P(r) means that for all k > 1, the sequence has k-1 copies of k, starting at index (k-1)r + T(k-2) + 1, and each of these runs is preceded by r smaller terms. (Thus, r is the number of 1s preceding the first 2 in the sequence.)
%C A376238 With these definitions the present sequence A376238 = S[2] = D(A376239) has property P(2).
