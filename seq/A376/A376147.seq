%N A376147 a(1)=1, followed by array T(n,k), n>=1, k>=2 read by antidiagonals (downwards) wherein the first row is A056240, and the k-th column records in ascending order the numbers m such that A001414(m) = k.
%C A376147 The columns of T(n,k) are of finite length, corresponding to A000607(k), whereas the rows are of infinite length. This is a permutation of A064364 (which reads 1 plus the consecutive columns of T(n,k)), and hence of the positive integers A000027.
%e A376147 Construct the irregular table T(n,k) as follows:
%e A376147 The first row T(1,k) is A056240, smallest number whose sum of prime divisors (with multiplicity) is k (k>=2).  The second row T(2,k) is the second smallest number (if it exists) whose sum of prime divisors is k, and so on. The k-th column is then the ordered list of the A000607(k) numbers (k>=2) whose prime divisors sum to k, the final term of which is A000792(k), after which the k-th column contains no further terms. The sum of the terms in the k-th column (k>=2) is A002098(k).
%e A376147 Read the table T(n,k) by antidiagonals downwards to obtain the data:
%e A376147   2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 7, 15, 14, 21, 11, 35, 13.. (A056240)
%e A376147            6, 9,10, 16, 20, 25, 28, 42, 22..
