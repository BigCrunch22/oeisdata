%N A376862 Unitary Zumkeller numbers whose divisors can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets with equal sums and cardinalities.
%C A376862 A unitary divisor of n is a divisor d such that gcd(d,n/d)=1.
%C A376862 This sequence is an intersection of A290466 and A347063 and seemingly a subsequence of A293188.
%C A376862 From the facts: a) for n>2 every primorial(n), i.e. A002110(n), is a Zumkeller number, b) a(1) = 30 = 2*3*5 is primorial(3), c) if n is squarefree, than sigma(n) = usigma(n), d) the number of unitary divisors of n is 2^k, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of n, and e) p*y belongs to A347063, where p is a prime coprime to y and y belongs to A347063, it follows that the present sequence is infinite, since for m >= 3 primorial(m) is a term.
%C A376862 It seems that for k >= 0 all numbers of the form 30 + 36k are terms.

%e A376862 The set of divisors of 90 is {1,2,3,5,6,9,10,15,18,30,45,90}, which is a union of the sets {1,2,3,6,15,90} and {5,9,10,18,30,45}, which have equal sums (117) and cardinalities (6). So, 90 is a term.
