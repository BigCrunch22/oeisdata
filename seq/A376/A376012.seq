%N A376012 a(n) = number of solutions (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) to Product_{i=1..n} (1 + 1/x_i) = any integer.
%C A376012 Number of ways any integer is a product of n superparticular ratios, without regard to order.  A superparticular ratio is a ratio of the form (m+1)/m.
%e A376012 For n = 2, a(2) = 3, three solutions, {x_1, x_2} = {2, 3} = 2; {1, 2} = 3; {1, 1} = 4.
%e A376012 In other words, a(2) = 3 since 2 can be written as (3/2)(4/3), 3 can be written as (2/1)(3/2), and 4 can be written as (2/1)^2, but no other integers are the product of two superparticular ratios.
%e A376012 a(3) = 12 since 2 can be written in 5 ways, 3 can be written in 3 ways, and 4, 5, 6, and 8 can be written in 1 way each, as the product of three superparticular ratios.
