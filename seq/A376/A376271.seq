%N A376271 Numbers k such that there exists at least one proper divisor that is neither squarefree nor a prime power, i.e., m is in A126706.
%C A376271 Numbers k such that A376514(k) > 1. A376514(k) >= 1 for all k in A126706.
%C A376271 Numbers k such that the cardinality of the intersection of row n of A027750 and A126706 exceeds 1.
%C A376271 a(n) is not in A366825, since for k in A366825, there is only one divisor that is in A126706, and that is k itself.

%e A376271 4 is not in the sequence since 4 is a prime power, and all divisors d | k of prime power k = p^e are also prime powers.
%e A376271 6 is not in the sequence since 6 is squarefree, and all divisors d | k of squarefree k are also squarefree.
%e A376271 12 is not in the sequence since 12 is in A366825, and there is only 1 divisor in A126706, which is 12 itself.
%e A376271 24 is in the sequence since the intersection of A126706 and row 24 of A027750, indicated by bracketed numbers, is {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, [12, 24]}, etc.
