%N A376779 The terms of A329447 sorted into increasing order.
%C A376779 Is there an independent characterization of these numbers? The following seems like a promising attack. Let the sequence {b(n)} be obtained by deleting the right-most digit of each a(n). Then for k from 1 though 10, k appears 11-k times in {b(n)}, and the numbers 10*k+i missing from {a(n)} correspond to  i = 1,2,...,k-1.
