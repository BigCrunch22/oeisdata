%N A376240 a(n) = number of {x,y,z} in Z/nZ such that x+y+z = x*y*z is nonzero.
%C A376240 Similar to A376183, but the sum equal to the product is restricted to be nonzero, as to exclude many rather trivial solutions.
%C A376240 Counting sets {x, y, z} means that the order of the three (not necessarily distinct) values is irrelevant. Equivalently, one could use representatives with, e.g., x <= y <= z.
%e A376240 For n=1, we can't have x+y+z = x*y*z nonzero because zero is the only element, so there are a(1) = 0 solutions.
%e A376240 For n=2, x+y+z = x*y*z != 0 implies x = y = z = 1 (in Z/2Z), so there is only one unique solution, and a(2) = 1.
%e A376240 For n=3, x+y+z = x*y*z != 0 is impossible: if x = y = z, the sum is zero (in Z/3Z), and 1 + 2 + z = 1*2*z <=> z = 0, so there is no solution, a(3) = 0.
%e A376240 For n=4, since 2*2 = 0 in Z/4Z, at most one among {x, y, z}, say z, can equal 2. In this case, x = -y = +-1, gives a solution {x, y, z} = {1, 2, 3}. One then checks that x = +-y = z = +-1 can't yield a solution, so a(4) = 1.
%e A376240 For n=5, we see that (x, y) = (2, 3) gives z = z, so we have a solution for any nonzero z, and exhaustive verification shows that these are no other solutions: a(5) = 4.

%Y A376240 Cf. A376183 (same without restriction to nonzero sum/product).
