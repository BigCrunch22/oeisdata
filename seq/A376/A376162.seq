%N A376162 Number of ordered partitions of S={(i,j):1 <= i , j <= n} where for every i and j the pairs (i+1,j) and (i,j+1) are in a later part than the part containing the pair (i,j), and the pairs (i,j), (j,i) are in the same part.
%C A376162 Ordered partitions are also called weak orderings.
%C A376162 Any such ordered partition can be written as a list of pairs (i,j) with 1 <= i <= j <= n, with either "=" or "<" between each pair, and so that (i,j) appears in the list before (i+1,j) (if i<n) and before (i,j+1) (if j<n). The list is not always unique, however.
%C A376162 Given any set A={a_1<...<a_n} of real numbers with sumset A+A={s_1<...<s_k}, the ordered partition of S whose parts are the sets P_x = {(i,j): a_i+a_j = s_x}, with the parts ordered by P_1<P_2<...<P_k, gives an example of the type of ordered partition being counted.
%C A376162 Given any set A={a_1<...<a_n} of positive integers with sumset A+A={s_1<...<s_k}, the ordered partition of S whose parts are the sets P_x = {(i,j): a_i * a_j = s_x}, with the parts ordered by P_1<P_2<...<P_k, gives an example of the type of ordered partition being counted.
%C A376162 Equivalently, a(n) is the number of n X n symmetric matrices whose values cover an initial interval of positive integers and whose rows have values which are strictly increasing. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Sep 15 2024

%F A376162 a(n) <= A000670(n*(n+1)/2).
%e A376162 For n=2 the a(2)=1 ordered partition is {(1,1)}<{(2,1),(1,2)}<{(2,2)}. We can encode this as 11<12<22, writing "ij" for the pair (i,j).
%e A376162 For n=3 one of the a(3)=3 ordered partitions is {(1,1)}<{(1,2),(2,1)}<{(1,3),(3,1),(2,2)}<{(2,3),(3,2)}<{(3,3)}, which is encoded as either 11<12<13=22<23<33 or 11<12<22=13<23<33. The other two ordered partitions can be encoded as 11<12<22<13<23<33 and 11<12<13<22<23<33.
