%N A376451 Quarter-squares greedy Champernowne sequence (or word): write the numbers 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, as in A376450 and concatenate.
%C A376451 The quarter-square base is A002620 = (1,2,4,6,9,12,16,...), in which 15 = 12 + 2 + 1, written in quarter-square base as 100011, which contributes 1,0,0,1,1 to this sequence.
