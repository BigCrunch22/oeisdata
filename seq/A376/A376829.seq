%N A376829 Numbers m whose symmetric representation of sigma(m) has at least a part with maximum width 3.
%C A376829 All terms m in this sequence for which SRS(m) consists of 1 or 2 parts are even.
%C A376829 Let m = 2^k * q, k >= 0 and q > 2 odd, be a number in this sequence. Let c be the number of divisors r <= A003056(m) of q for which there is at most one pair of divisors s and t of q satisfying r < s < t <= min( 2^(k+1) * r, A003056(m)). Call such triples (r, s, t) good triples. Then at least one good triple exists for number m.
%C A376829 Let w be the number of times that width 3 occurs in the width pattern of m (row m in the triangle of A341969). Then c = (w + 1)/2 when the width at the diagonal is equal to 3 and c = w/2 otherwise.
%e A376829 a(1) = 60 has one good triple 1 < 3 < 5 of odd divisors which determines 2 width 3 occurrences in its width pattern 1 2 3 2 3 2 1, and SRS(60) has width 2 at the diagonal.
%e A376829 a(2) = 72 has one good triple 1 < 3 < 9 of odd divisors which determines 1 width 3 occurrence in its unimodal width pattern 1 2 3 2 1, and SRS(72) has width 3 at the diagonal.
%e A376829 a(18) = 315 is the smallest odd number in the sequence and SRS(315) has three parts. SRS(a(1)) .. SRS(a(17)) each consists of a single part.
%e A376829 a(41) = 648 = 2^3 * 3^4 has two good triples 1 < 3 < 9 and 3 < 9 < 27 of odd divisors which determine 3 width 3 occurrences in its width pattern 1 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 1, and SRS(648) has width 3 at the diagonal.
%e A376829 a(57) = 882 has two good triples  1 < 7 < 9 and 7 < 9 < 21 of odd divisors which determine 4 width 3 occurrences in its width pattern is 1 2 1 2 3 2 3 2 1 2 3 2 3 2 1 2 1, and SRS(882) has width 1 at the diagonal.
%e A376829 a(514) = 7620 is the smallest number with 2 parts in its symmetric representation of sigma. It has two good triples  1 < 3 < 5 and 3 < 5 < 15 of odd divisors which determine 4 width 3 occurrences in its width pattern 1 2 3 2 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 2 3 2 1 and width 0 at the diagonal.
%e A376829 a(734) = 10728 is the smallest number in the sequence for which SRS(10728) has 2 parts and 2 occurrences of width 3. Each of its 2 parts therefore is unimodal: 1 2 3 2 1 0 1 2 3 2 1.
