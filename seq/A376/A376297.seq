%N A376297 Smallest terms which are the concatenation of two unambiguous distinct integers > 0.
%C A376297 The sequence is infinite as it can always be extended with the smallest integer <1(n times 0)1> not yet present.
%e A376297 10 is not in the sequence because 0 is not > 0.
%e A376297 11 is not in the sequence because 1 and 1 are not distinct.
%e A376297 21 is not in the sequence because 12 is already in it.
%e A376297 101 is in the sequence because it can be unambiguously split into the two distinct integers 10 and 1.
%e A376297 110 is not in the sequence because 101 is already in it.
%e A376297 111 is in the sequence because it can be split into the two distinct integers 1 and 11 (though in two ways).
