%N A376504 Number of divisors of n that are both composite and squarefree.
%C A376504 Also number of composite and squarefree m <= n such that rad(m) | n, i.e., in row n of A162306, where rad = A007947.
%C A376504 This sequence is distinct from A327517; A327517(210) != a(210).
%C A376504 Record setters are primorials, a(6) = 1, a(30) = 4, a(210) = 11, etc., since primorials P(n) = A002110(n) are the smallest instance of omega(n) = A001221(n).
