%N A376216 Numbers whose sum of powerful divisors (including 1) is even.
%C A376216 The sequence of numbers whose number of powerful divisors (including 1, A005361) is even is A072587, which is the sequence of numbers that are not exponentially odd (A268335).
%C A376216 The primitive terms of this sequence are the powerful terms (A376217). If m is a powerful term then k*m is a term of this sequence for all squarefree numbers k that are coprime to m.
%C A376216 Numbers that have at least one odd prime factor in their prime factorization that has an even exponent.
%C A376216 Numbers whose odd part (A000265) is not an exponentially odd number (A268335).
%C A376216 Also, numbers k such that A335341(k) is even.
%C A376216 The asymptotic density of this sequence is 1 - (6/5) * A065463 = 0.15466935880100128871... .
