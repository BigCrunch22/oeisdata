%N A376239 a(n) = index k of the column in which n is found, if the columns k = 1, 2, 3, ... are initially filled with numbers T(k-1)+1, ..., T(k) = k(k+1)/2, and when n is found in column k, then the top element of each subsequent column (k+1, k+2, ...) is moved to the top of the previous column (k, k+1, ...).
%C A376239 Between indices that are triangular numbers, T(k-1) < n < T(k) := k(k+1)/2 = A000217(k), the number k occurs k-1 times (cf. Examples).
%C A376239 In the sequence S[2] = a(T(k), k >= 1) = (1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 3, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 2, 7, 7, ...), each number k appears again k-1 times in a row, but these runs are now separated by two smaller numbers.
%C A376239 If we remove again the runs of k-1 consecutive k in that sequence S[2] = a o T, we get the sequence S[3] = (1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 3, ...) where again each k > 1 occurs k-1 times in a row, but these runs now separated by three other elements.
%C A376239 Conjecture: Starting with S[1] = A376239, if S[r+1] = D(r) S[r] for all r >= 1, then each sequence S[r] has the property P(r). Here we denote by D(r) the operation of deleting the substring of k-1 copies of k starting at index (k-1)r + T(k-2) + 1, for all k > 1, and keeping only the intermediate chunks of length r. By property P(r) we mean that for each k > 1, the sequence contains k-1 consecutive terms equal to k, starting at index (k-1)r + T(k-2) + 1, each such run being preceded by r terms < k.
%C A376239 For example, this sequence S[1] = A376239 has property P(1), S[2] = D(1) S[1] = A376239 o T has property P(2), and S[3] = D(2) S[2] has property P(3).
%F A376239 a(n) = k for T(k-1) < n < T(k) := k(k+1)/2 = A000217(k).
%e A376239 a(1) = 1 is the index of the first column, where n = 1 is found. Then we move the top element T(2) = 3 from col.2 to this col.1, and T(3) = 6 from col.3 to col.2, etc.
%e A376239 Then a(2) = 2 is the index of the second column, where n = 2 is found. Then we move the top element T(4) = 10 from col.3 to this col.2, and T(5) = 15 from col.4 to col.3, etc.
%e A376239 Then a(3) = 1 is the index of the first column, to which n = 2 had been moved in the first step. Now we move the top element T(4) = 10 from col.2 to this col.1, and T(5) = 15 from col.3 to col.2, etc.
%e A376239 Then a(4) = a(5) = 3 is the column where n = 4 and n = 5 are found. (We see that the number 3 is repeated 2 times between n = T(2) = 3 and n = T(3) = 6.) Each time we move the top element of all subsequent columns to the column immediately before. And so on.
