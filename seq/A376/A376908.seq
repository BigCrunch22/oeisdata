%N A376908 a(0) = 0. For n >= 0, if a(n-1) is a novel term, a(n) = a(a(n-1)). If a(n-1) > 0 has been seen k(>1) times, a(n) = k*a(n-1), unless k*a(n-1) > n, in which case a(n) = 0. If a(n-1) = 0 has been seen k(>1) times, a(n) = k.
%C A376908 It seems that a(n) <= n with equality (in first 2^24 terms) only for n = 0,2,4,12,200, 216, 360, 2646.
%C A376908 a(n-1) = 0 is followed by k, the number of zeros seen so far, (rather than k*a(n-1) as for nonzero terms), otherwise the sequence would contain only zeros. The a(n) = 0 clause is necessary to ensure continuation of the sequence at points, since without it there would be occasions where a(n) = a(a(m)) but a(m) is not yet defined. The first such instance follows a(5) = 4, the second time 4 appears, upon which we would have a(6) = 2*4 = 8, a novel term so a(7) = a(a(8)), but a(8) is not yet defined. By setting a(6) = 0 the sequence can continue (see Example).

%e A376908 a(0) = 0 a novel term, implies a(1) = a(a(0)) = a(0) = 0.
%e A376908 Now we have a(0) = a(1) = 0, so k = 2, which from the definition means a(2) = 2.
%e A376908 a(2) = 2 is a novel term so a(3) = a(a(2)) = a(2) = 2.
%e A376908 Because 2 has occurred twice we have a(4) = 2*2 = 4.
%e A376908 a(4) = 4 is a novel term so a(5) = a(a(4)) = a(4) = 4, the second occurrence of 4.
%e A376908 Since 2*4 = 8 exceeds 6, the index of the next term we invoke the 0 clause so a(6) = 0.
%e A376908 Now 0 has occurred three times, so a(7) = 3, a novel term making a(8) = a(a(3)) = 2.
