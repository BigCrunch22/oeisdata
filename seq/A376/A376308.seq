%N A376308 Run-compression of the sequence of first differences of prime-powers.
%C A376308 We define the run-compression of a sequence to be the anti-run obtained by reducing each run of repeated parts to a single part. Alternatively, run-compression removes all parts equal to the part immediately to their left. For example, (1,1,2,2,1) has run-compression (1,2,1).
%e A376308 The sequence of prime-powers (A246655) is:
%e A376308   2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32, 37, ...
%e A376308 The sequence of first differences (A057820) of prime-powers is:
%e A376308   1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 5, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, ...
%e A376308 The run-compression is A376308 (this sequence).
