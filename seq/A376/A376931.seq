%C A376931 Put n distinct points on the edge of a circle. Connect the first to the point 1 step clockwise from it, then connect that one to the point 2 steps clockwise from that, continuing with 3 steps, 4 steps, etc. In the end, a(n) is the number of points never landed on.
%F A376931 a(n) = n - A117484(n).
