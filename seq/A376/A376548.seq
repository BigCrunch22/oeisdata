%N A376548 a(1)=1,a(2)=2. Let p be the smallest prime factor of j=a(n-1), then for n>2 a(n) is the smallest novel multiple of Sopfr(j) if j is in A046363, or of p if it is not.
%C A376548 If j=a(n-1) is in A046363 then a(n) = A001414(j) = prime q, and a(n+1) is the least novel multiple of q. Otherwise a(n) is the least novel multiple of the smallest prime factor of j. After a prime term a(n) the sequence produces a string of terms each divisible by the smallest prime factor of a(n+1) until arriving at a term in A046363, whereupon a new prime appears and the process repeats.
%C A376548 Conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers A000027, in which the primes do not appear in order (prime order starts:2,5,7,3,13,11,19,17,31,23,43..).

%e A376548 a(2)=2 is not a term in A046360, and has smallest prime factor 2, so a(3) = 4, the least novel multiple of 2. Likewise a(4)=6 since a(3)=4 is not in A046360 and the smallest prime factor of 4 is 2.
%e A376548 a(4)=6 is a term in A046360, so a(5)=A001414(6)=5.
%e A376548 a(6)=10 since 5 is the smallest prime factor of 5, and 10 is the smallest novel multiple of 5.
%e A376548 If a(n-1) = prime p, a(n) is the least novel multiple of p, for example a(12) = 3 and since a(4) = 6 it follows that a(13) = 9. Likewise a(19) = 13, and since no prior term is divisible by 13, a(20) = 36.
