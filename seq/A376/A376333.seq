%N A376333 Numbers m whose symmetric representation of sigma(m), SRS(m), consists of widths 0, 1, and 2.
%C A376333 Sequence a(n) is the subsequence of A375611 for which the symmetric representation of sigma(a(n)) has at least two parts. The width at the diagonal can be any of the 3 widths.
%C A376333 Let m = 2^k * q, k >= 0 and q odd, be a number in this sequence. Let c be the number of divisors s <= A003056(m) of q for which there is at most one divisor t of q satisfying s < t <= min( 2^(k+1) * s, A003056(m). Let w be the number of times width 2 occurs in the width pattern of m (row m in the triangle of A341960). Then c = (w + 1)/2 when the width at the diagonal is equal to 2 and c = w/2 otherwise.
%e A376333 SRS(a(1)) consists of 3 parts, its width pattern is 1 0 1 2 1 0 1, and c = 1 with divisor 3.
%e A376333 a(6) = 75 is the smallest number in this sequence which has width  0 on the diagonal; SRS(75) has 4 parts.
%e A376333 a(8) = 78 is the smallest number in this sequence with width pattern 1 2 1 0 1 2 1 (see A370206 and A370209).
%e A376333 a(35) = 225 is the smallest number in the sequence with width 1 on the diagonal; its width pattern is 1 0 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 0 1; w = 6 and c = 3 with divisors 3, 5, and 9.
