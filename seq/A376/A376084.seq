%N A376084 Number of cryptarithmically unique primes with n decimal digits.
%C A376084 Terms for n > 11 are conjectured based on the assumption that at these lengths A374238 does not contain terms with 4 or more distinct digits, which follows from the vanishing probability of such terms estimated with combinatorial arguments.
%C A376084 a(n) gives the number of n-digit primes p for which no other prime shares the same digit pattern, A358497(p).
%C A376084 a(n) is the count of terms in A374238 of length n.
%C A376084 a(n) shows anomalously small values for n divisible by 3 because certain digit patterns cannot result in primes based on divisibility rules: Whenever every digit occurs a number of times that is divisible by 3, the sum of digits is also divisible by 3, and therefore the number cannot be prime. For example, for n=12 all patterns consisting of 2 distinct digits A and B with the number of both A's and B's divisible by 3 (such as "AABABAAAABAA" and alike) cannot produce primes and therefore do not contribute to the total count. As a result, a(n) is not monotonic.
%e A376084 a(2)=1 because the only cryptarithmically unique prime (A374238) with 2 digits is 11. Indeed, any other 2-digit natural number with the same pattern "AA" is divisible by 11, whereas no 2-digit prime with the pattern "AB" of two nonequal digits is cryptarithmically unique because there are 20 primes that share the same pattern (all 2-digit primes except 11).
%e A376084 a(3)=0 because there are no cryptarithmically unique primes (A374238) with 3 digits.
%e A376084 a(7)=2 because there are exactly two cryptarithmically unique primes with 7 digits, which are 3333311 and 7771717.
%Y A376084 Cf. A374238 (cryptarithmically unique primes), A004022 (prime repunits), A358497.
