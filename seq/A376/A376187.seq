%N A376187 For a line L in the plane, let C(L) denote the number of prime points [k, prime(k)] on L, and let M(L) denote the maximum prime(k) for any of these points; a(n) = minimum M(L) over all lines with C(L) = n, or -1 if there is no such line.
%C A376187 THERE ARE ERRORS IN THE DATA, WHICH WILL BE CORRECTED TOMORROW. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 26 2024
%C A376187 C(L) is the total number of prime points on L, by definition.
%C A376187 This sequence minimises the largest prime in any line containing n prime-points: for the maximal smallest prime in any such line, see  A376190.
%C A376187 If C(L) = n in the definition is changed to C(L) >= n we get A376188.

%e A376187 The following are lines corresponding to a(1) to a(8). We describe the lines by simply listing the primes "prime(k)" corresponding to the points on the line.

%e A376187 The 9-, 10, 11-point lines (here we give the full [x,y] coordinates) are:
%e A376187 [[98, 521], [104, 569], [792, 6073], [794, 6089], [797, 6113], [798, 6121], [824, 6329], [825, 6337], [827, 6353]] (Found by _W. Edwin Clark_, Sep 25 2024),
%e A376187 [[30, 113], [39, 167], [40, 173], [41, 179], [43, 191], [49, 227], [69, 347], [81, 419], [83, 431], [98, 521]],
%e A376187 and
%e A376187 [[23, 83 ], [24, 89], [26, 101], [102, 557], [103, 563], [104, 569], [107, 587], [108, 593], [109, 599], [116, 641], [126, 701]].
%e A376187 It is interesting that the 9-point line starts at the point where the 10-point line ends.
%e A376187 There are two parallel lines of slope 6 which both contain 20 points. The first contains the points with [x,y] coordinates [45, 197], [51, 233], [52, 239], [54, 251], [55, 257], [56, 263], [57, 269], [64, 311], [71, 353], [72, 359], [76, 383], [77, 389], [79, 401], [86, 443], [87, 449], [89, 461], [92, 479], [94, 491], [96, 503], [97, 509],
%e A376187 and the second contains the points [42, 181], [44, 193], [47, 211], [50, 229], [63, 307], [67, 331], [68,337], [70, 349], [73, 367], [74, 373], [75, 379], [78, 397], [80, 409],[82, 421], [84, 433], [85, 439], [88, 457], [93, 487], [95, 499], [99, 523].
%e A376187 The first iine has M(L) = 509, and suggests that a(20) may be 509. The existence of these two lines was confirmed by _W. Edwin Clark_, who produced the illustration in the LINKS section. This shows an enlargement of the region 35 <= x <= 105. The blue dots are the points on the first line, the red dots those on the second line.
%e A376187 It is interesting to contrast these two 20-point lines with the results in A005115, which gives the earliest arithmetic progressions of primes with a given number of terms. To find an arithmetic progression of 20 primes one has to go out to 572945039351. Of course these primes don't lie on a line, because of the irregular spacing between the primes.
%e A376187 For many further examples of lines containing many prime-points see the Table in the LINKS section.
