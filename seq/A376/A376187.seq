%N A376187 For a line L in the plane, let C(L) denote the number of prime points [k, prime(k)] on L, and let M(l) denote the maximum prime(k) for any of these points; a(n) = minimum M(L) over all lines with C(L) = n, or -1 if there is no such line.
%C A376187 C(L) is the total number of prime points on L, by definition.
%C A376187 If C(L) = n is changed to C(L) >= n we get A376188.

%e A376187 The following are lines corresponding to a(1) to a(8). We describe the lines by simply listing the primes "prime(k)" corresponding to the points on the line.

%e A376187 I did not find a line with exactly 9 points on it, so perhaps a(9) = -1 (although this seems very unlikely).
%e A376187 There are two parallel lines of slope 6 which both contain 20 points. The first contains the points with [x,y] coordinates [45, 197], [51, 233], [52, 239], [54, 251], [55, 257], [56, 263], [57, 269], [64, 311], [71, 353], [72, 359], [76, 383], [77, 389], [79, 401], [86, 443], [87, 449], [89, 461], [92, 479], [94, 491], [96, 503], [97, 509],
%e A376187 and the second contains the points [42, 181], [44, 193], [47, 211], [50, 229], [63, 307], [67, 331], [68,337], [70, 349], [73, 367], [74, 373], [75, 379], [78, 397], [80, 409],[82, 421], [84, 433], [85, 439], [88, 457], [93, 487], [95, 499], [99, 523].
%e A376187 The first iine has M(L) = 509, and suggests that a(20) may be 509. The existence of these two lines was confirmed by _W. Edwin Clark_, who produced the illustration in the LINKS section. This shows an enlargement of the region 35 <= x <= 105. The blue dots are the points on the first line, the red dots those on the second line.
%e A376187 It is interesting to contrast these two 20-point lines with the results in A005115. This sequence gives the earliest arithmetic progressions of primes with a given number of terms. To find an arithmetic progression of 20 primes one has to go out to 572945039351. Of course these primes don't lie on a line, because of the irregular spacing between the primes.
