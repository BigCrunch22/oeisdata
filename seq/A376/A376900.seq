%N A376900 Number of isomorphism classes k of groups G of order n where G is not a semidirect product.
%C A376900 There are a few equivalent conditions for a group G to be a semidirect product of subgroups N and H, where N is normal in G (if H is also normal, then the semidirect product is a direct product). See the Wikipedia link for these equivalent conditions.
%C A376900 One condition with an interesting consequence is the following. If G is a semidirect product of N and H, then the exact sequence of homomorphisms 1 -> N -> G -> H -> 1 is split, meaning there exists a homomorphism f: H -> G. When a sequence is split, H = G/N is isomorphic to the image of f, which is a subgroup of G. This means that the extension factors which form G are contained within G (up to isomorphism). For a sequence 1 -> A -> G -> B -> 1 which is not split (and therefore G is not a semidirect product) the factor B = G/A is not isomorphic to a subgroup of G, and therefore G, seen as an extension of B by A, is composed of a factor B which lies outside of it.

%F A376900 a(A000040(n)) = 1 since the only group of prime order is prime cyclic which is trivially not a semidirect product as it contains no proper subgroups let alone proper normal subgroups.
%F A376900 a(A120944(n)) = 0. This is because every group of squarefree order contains a normal Hall subgroup (a subgroup whose order is coprime to its index). Every such group is a semidirect product by the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem.
%F A376900 a(p^a*q^b) = 0 for distinct primes p and q, a >= 1, b >= 1. This is also because every G of order p^a*q^b contains a normal Hall subgroup and is therefore a semidirect product by the Schur-Zassenhaus theorem.
%e A376900 a(2) = 1 since the cyclic group C2 is not a semidirect product and is the only group of order 2.
%e A376900 a(6) = 0 since C6 and S3, the symmetric group on 3 elements, are both semidirect products and are the only groups of order 6. (C6 = C2 x C3, and S3 = D6 = C2 : C3).
%e A376900 a(8) = 2 since C8 and Q8, the quaternion group, are not semidirect products and every other group of order 8 is a semidirect product.
