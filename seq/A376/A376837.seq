%N A376837 a(n) is the number of paths to reach a position outside an 8X8 chessboard after n steps, starting in one of the corners, when performing a walk with unit steps on the square lattice.
%C A376837 a(n)/4^n is the probability that the 1-step rook falls off the chess board at step n. The average number of steps it takes this piece to fall off the board is Sum_{n>0} n*a(n)/4^n = A376606(8)/A376607(8) = 4374/901 or approximately 4.855 steps.
%C A376837 Because of the mirror symmetry of the problem to the board diagonal, all terms are even.
%F A376837 a(n) == 0 (mod 2).
%e A376837 a(3) = 6. Starting on square a1 there are 6 paths to leave the chess board: up-up-left, up-down-left, up-down-down, right-right-down, right-left-down and right-left-left.
%Y A376837 Cf. A376606, A376607, {A052899}+1 is the analog for the 4X4 chessboard.
