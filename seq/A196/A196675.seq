%N A196675 The n-th Chebyshev primes that are equal to the 2n-th primes.
%C A196675 The Chebyshev primes (of index 1) are such odd primes that satisfy li[psi(p)]-li[psi(p-1)]<1 (sequence A196667), where li(x) is the logarithmic integral and psi(x) is the Chebyshev's psi function.
%C A196675 The present sequence lists the n-th Chebyshev primes that are equal to the 2n-th primes.
%C A196675 See A199674 for the number n at the zeros of the function a(n)-p_{2n}, where a(n) is the n-th Chebyshev prime and p_{2n} the 2n-th prime.
