%N A196225 Smallest number k such that sigma(tau(k)) = n, or 0 if there is no such k.
%C A196225 Smallest number k such that A062069(k) = A000203(A000005(k)) = n, or 0 if there is no such k.
%F A196225 a(n)=0 iff A051444(n) = 0.
%e A196225 a(6) = 16 because number 16 is the smallest number k such that sigma(tau(k)) = 6; (tau(16)=5, sigma(5)=6).
