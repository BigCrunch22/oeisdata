%N A196440 a(n) = the sum of numbers k <= n such that GCQ_A(n, k) >= 2 (see definition in comments).
%C A196440 Definition of GCQ_A: The greatest common non-divisor of type A (GCQ_A) of two positive integers a and b (a<=b) is the largest positive non-divisor q of numbers a and b such that 1<=q<=a common to a and b; GCQ_A(a, b) = 0, if  no such c exists.
%C A196440 GCQ_A(1, b) = GCQ_A(2, b) = 0 for b >=1. GCQ_A(a, b) = 0 or >= 2.
%C A196440 a(n) is also the sum of number k <= n such that LCQ_A(n, k) >= 2.
%C A196440 Definition of LCQ_A: The least common non-divisor of type A (LCQ_A) of two positive integers a and b (a<=b) is the least positive non-divisor q of numbers a and b such that 1<=q<=a common to a and b; LCQ_A(a, b) = 0 if  no such c exists.
%C A196440 LCQ_A(1, b) = LCQ_A(2, b) = 0 for b >=1. LCQ_A(a, b) = 0 or >= 2.

%F A196440 a(n) = A000217(n) - A196439(n).
%e A196440 For n = 6, a(6) = 11 because there are 2 cases k (k = 5, 6) with GCQ_A(6, k) >= 2:

%e A196440 Also there are 2 same cases k  with LCQ_A(6, k) >= 2:
