%N A196067 Number of pendant vertices in the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number n.
%C A196067 A pendant vertex in a tree is a vertex having degree 1.
%C A196067 The Matula-Goebel number of a rooted tree can be defined in the following recursive manner: to the one-vertex tree there corresponds the number 1; to a tree T with root degree 1 there corresponds the t-th prime number, where t is the Matula-Goebel number of the tree obtained from T by deleting the edge emanating from the root; to a tree T with root degree m>=2 there corresponds the product of the Matula-Goebel numbers of the m branches of T.

%F A196067 a(1)=0; a(2)=2; if n=p(t) (=the t-th prime) and t is prime, then a(n)=a(t); if n=p(t) (the t-th prime) and t is not prime, then a(n)=1+a(t); if n=rs (r,s,>=2), then a(n)=a(r)+a(s)-the number of primes in {r,s}. The Maple program is based on this recursive formula.
%e A196067 a(7)=3 because the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number 7 is the rooted tree Y.
%e A196067 a(2^m) = m because the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number 2^m is a star with m edges.
