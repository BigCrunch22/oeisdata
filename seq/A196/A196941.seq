%N A196941 a(n) is the minimum prime (or 1) needed to write integer n into the form n = a + b such that all prime factors of a and b are smaller or equal to a(n).
%C A196941 Any integer n that is greater than 1 can be written into the sum of two other positive integers, such that n = a + b.  There are IntegerPart[n / 2] ways to do this assuming a <= b.  For each of the ways, we can have a set of prime factor of a and b, defined as sa = FactorSet[a] and sb = FactorSet[b], quoting the function in the Mathematica program.  Then we can define a union set s=Union[sa, sb], which is a list of prime factors that can factor either a or b.  In this way we obtain IntegerPart[n / 2] of possible set s.  Define p_i is the largest prime number in each of set s_i, i = 1,2...IntegerPart[n / 2], a(n) = the smallest s_i.
%C A196941 Though 2 =  1 + 1 and 1 is not a prime number, a(2) can still be defined as 1.
%C A196941 The Mathematica program generates up to term 88.
%C A196941 The first occurrence of a(n)=k forms sequence A000229. - _Lei Zhou_, Feb 06 2014
