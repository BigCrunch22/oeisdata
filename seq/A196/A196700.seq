%F A196700 From _Gregory L. Simay_, Jun 23 2017: (Start)
%F A196700 a(n) = A000073(n+2) - A000073(n-2), the difference of two tribonacci numbers. The corresponding g.f. is (1 - x^4)/(1 - x - x^2 - x^3). E.g.: a(10) = A000073(12) - A000073(8) = 274 - 24 = 250.
%F A196700 The tribonacci formula arises from considering the number of compositions of n where only the order of parts 1,2,3 matters (part of an upcoming paper), which may be denoted by C(n [4). We are convolving the number of partitions of n with parts >3 with the tribonacci numbers. The number of partitions of n with parts greater than 3 is P(n) - P(n-1) - P(n-2) + P(n-4) + P(n-5) - P(n-6). (Derived from the corresponding gf which is (1-x)(1-x^2)(1-x^3)gfP(x).) The rest is algebra. It looks like C(n, [4) = P(n) + Sum_{j=0..n-3} P(n-3-j)*A196700(j+1). (End)
