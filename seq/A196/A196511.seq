%N A196511 Primes q for which there are primes b < c < p such that b^p == c^p == 1 (mod q^2).
%C A196511 Computed mainly by M. Oakes and D. Broadhurst, cf. link.
%C A196511 For all the listed terms, except for a(4)=2452757 and a(11)=22796069, p=(q-1)/2, which implies that they are "safe primes", cf. A005385. For a(4) and a(11), p=(q-1)/4.
%C A196511 The subsequence of terms of the form q=2p+1 is A196733. As of today it is complete up to its 51st term, ~2e8. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 05 2011
