%N A196153 Primes of the form 2*n^3 + 5*n^2 + 3*n + 1.
%C A196153 A rational number is created by 1/n + 1/n^2 + 1/(n+1) + 1/(n+1)^2 and has a reduced numerator of 2*n^3 + 5*n^2 + 3*n + 1.
%C A196153 From n=1 to 100, 38 primes, 48 semiprimes, and 14 numbers requiring three or more prime factors were created.  This is very anomalous compared to the expected distribution of such numbers from 1 to 2050301.
%e A196153 For n=37, 2*37^3 + 5*37^2 + 3*37 + 1 = 108263, a prime.
