%N A196097 Boundary of an n-ball in Novikov's hyperbolic triangular discretization of complex analysis.
%C A196097 One can discretize complex analysis by finding equivalents of the Cauchy-Riemann operator on various tilings of the complex plane. One of the solutions explored by Novikov is a plane of negative curvature analog to the Lobatchevskii plane made from triangles of alternative colors (black and white). a(n) gives the first terms of the length of the boundary of after n iterations.
%C A196097 Terms have been computed by Novikov and Mike Boyle.
