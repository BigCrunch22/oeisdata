%N A196226 m such that A054024(m) (sum of divisors of m reduced modulo m) is 3 + m/2.
%C A196226 This sequence appears to be identical to A073582 with its first term omitted and to A161344 with its first two terms omitted.
%C A196226 Conjectures.  (1) If m>=14 is a term of this sequence, then sigma(2,m) is congruent to 5 + m/2 modulo m;  (2) If m>=22 is a term of this sequence, then sigma(3,m) is congruent to 9 + m/2 modulo m;  If m>=38 is a term of this sequence, then sigma(4,m) is congruent to 17 + m/2 modulo m. (sigma(k,m) denotes the sum of the k-th powers of the divisors of m.)
%C A196226 Similar conjectures can be made about sigma(k,m) congruent to 2^k+1 + m/2 modulo m, for m a sufficiently large term of this sequence..
%C A196226 The even semiprimes (A100484) m= 2*p with p>3, with sigma(2*p)= 3+p (mod 2p), are a subsequence. - _R. J. Mathar_, Oct 02 2011
