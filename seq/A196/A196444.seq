%N A196444 a(n) = the smallest number m such that GCQ_A(m, k) = LCQ_A(m, k) = 0 for all 1 <= k <= n  (see definition in comments).
%C A196444 Definition of GCQ_A: The greatest common non-divisor of type A (GCQ_A) of two positive integers a and b (a<=b) is the largest positive non-divisor q of numbers a and b such that 1<=q<=a common to a and b; GCQ_A(a, b) = 0 if  no such c exists.
%C A196444 GCQ_A(1, b) = GCQ_A(2, b) = 0 for b >=1. GCQ_A(a, b) = 0 or >= 2.
%C A196444 Definition of LCQ_A: The least common non-divisor of type A (LCQ_A) of two positive integers a and b (a<=b) is the least positive non-divisor q of numbers a and b such that 1<=q<=a common to a and b; LCQ_A(a, b) = 0 if  no such c exists.
%C A196444 LCQ_A(1, b) = LCQ_A(2, b) = 0 for b >=1. LCQ_A(a, b) = 0 or >= 2.
%e A196444 For a(5) = 12 holds: GCQ_A(12, 1) = GCQ_A(12, 2) = GCQ_A(12, 3) = GCQ_A(12, 4) = GCQ_A(12, 5) = 0.
%e A196444 Also holds: LCQ_A(12, 1) = LCQ_A(12, 2) = LCQ_A(12, 3) = LCQ_A(12, 4) = LCQ_A(12, 5) = 0.
