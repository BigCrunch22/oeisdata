%N A263844 Constant term in expansion of n in Fraenkel's exotic ternary representation.
%C A263844 Let {p_i, i >= 0} = {1,3,7,17,41,99,...} denote the numerators of successive convergents to sqrt(2) (see A001333). Then any n >= 0 has a unique representation as n = Sum_{i >= 0} d_i*p_i, with 0 <= d_i <= 2, d_{i+1}=2 => d_i=0. Sequence gives a(n+1) = d_0.
%C A263844 From _Michel Dekking_, Feb 11 2018: (Start)
%C A263844 (a(n)) is the unique fixed point of the morphism alpha given by
%C A263844     alpha: 0 -> 012, 1 -> 012, 2 -> 0.
%C A263844 To see this, note first that the p_i satisfy p_{i+2}=2p_{i+1}+p_i for all i=1,2,... Then define a sequence of words by
%C A263844     w(0) = 0, w(1) = 012, w(i+2) = w(i+1)w(i+1)w(i).
%C A263844 The length of w(i) is equal to p_i. In the numeration system, the representation of n = p_i is d = 10..0, and the representation of n = 2p_i is d = 20..0. By unicity of the representation, the numbers n = p_i +m have the representation d = 1c, where c is the representation of m for m = 1,...,p_{i-1}. Similarly, because the digit 2 is required to be followed by the digit 0, the numbers n = 2p_i + m have the representation d =20c, where c is the representation of m for m = 1,...,p_{i-2}. It follows from this that the d_0 digits in the range 0 to p_{i+2} have to satisfy the equation w(i+2) = w(i+1)w(i+1)w(i). But alpha(0)=alpha(1)=w(1), and alpha(2)=w(0), which implies by induction that w(i) = alpha^i(0):
%C A263844     w(i+1) = w(i)w(i)w(i-1) = alpha^i(0) alpha^i(0) alpha^{i-1}(0) =
%C A263844     alpha^i(0) alpha^i(1)alpha^i(2) = alpha^i(012) = alpha^{i+1}(0).
%C A263844 (a(n)) is modulo a change of alphabet (0->1, 1->2, 2->3) equal to A294180, the standard form of (a(n)). This combined with the fact that the Pell word A171588 is a Sturmian word leads to the formula for (a(n)) below. (End)
