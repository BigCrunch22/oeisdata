%N A263273 Bijective base-3 reverse: a(0) = 0; for n >= 1, a(n) = A030102(A038502(n)) * A038500(n).
%C A263273 Here the base-3 reverse has been adjusted so that the maximal suffix of trailing zeros (in base-3 representation A007089) stays where it is at the right side, and only the section from the most significant digit to the least significant nonzero digit is reversed, thus making this sequence a self-inverse permutation of nonnegative integers.
%C A263273 Because successive powers of 3 and 9 modulo 2, 4 and 8 are always either constant 1, 1, 1, ... or alternating 1, -1, 1, -1, ... it implies similar simple divisibility rules for 2, 4 and 8 in base 3 as e.g. 3, 9 and 11 have in decimal base (see the Wikipedia-link). As these rules do not depend on which direction they are applied from, it means that this bijection preserves the fact whether a number is divisible by 2, 4 or 8, or whether it is not. Thus natural numbers are divided to several subsets, each of which is closed with respect to this bijection. See the Crossrefs section for permutations obtained from these sections.
%C A263273 When polynomials over GF(3) are encoded as natural numbers (coefficients presented with the digits of the base-3 expansion of n), this bijection works as a multiplicative automorphism of the ring GF(3)[X]. This follows from the fact that as there are no carries involved, the multiplication (and thus also the division) of such polynomials could be as well performed by temporarily reversing all factors (like they were seen through mirror). This implies also that the sequences A207669 and A207670 are closed with respect to this bijection.

%F A263273 A000035(a(n)) = A000035(n). [This permutation preserves the parity of n.]
%F A263273 A010873(a(n)) = 0 if and only if A010873(n) = 0. [See the comments section.]
%e A263273 For n = 15, A007089(15) = 120. Reversing this so that the trailing zero stays at the right yields 210 = A007089(21), thus a(15) = 21 and vice versa, a(21) = 15.
