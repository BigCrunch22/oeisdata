%N A263204 Number of twin prime pairs between n^2 and (n+2)^2.
%C A263204 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 except for n = 26.
%C A263204 (ii) For any integer n > 0, there is a cousin prime pair {p, p+4} between n^2 and (n+2)^2.
%C A263204 (iii) For each n = 1,2,3,... there is a prime p between n^2 and (n+2)^2 such that 2*p-1 is also prime. Also, for any integer n > 0 not equal to 55, there is a Sophie Germain prime between n^2 and (n+2)^2.
%C A263204 Compare this with Legendre's conjecture which states that for any integer n > 0 there is a prime between n^2 and (n+1)^2.

%e A263204 a(1) = 2 since there are exactly two twin prime pairs (namely, {3, 5} and {5, 7}) between 1^2 = 1 and (1+2)^2 = 9.
%e A263204 a(8) = 1 since there is a unique twin prime pair {71, 73} between 8^2 = 64 and (8+2)^2 = 100.
%e A263204 a(18) = 1 since there is a unique twin prime pair {347, 349} between 18^2 = 324 and (18+2)^2 = 400.
%e A263204 a(30) = 1 since there is a unique twin prime pair {1019, 1021} between 30^2 = 900 and (30+2)^2 = 1024.
