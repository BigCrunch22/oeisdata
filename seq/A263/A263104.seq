%N A263104 a(3k), a(3k+1), a(3k+2) are the numbers of edges between each vertex-pair in a multigraph with 3 vertices and k edges (with at least one edge between each vertex-pair) which has the minimum number of distinct cycles, if that arrangement of edges is unique.
%C A263104 Cycles are counted as in A263103. Each group of three is in ascending order.
%C A263104 The sequence is well-defined for all n checked so far; that is, there are no known k which produce two different multigraphs with the minimal number of cycles.
%C A263104 Viewing the sequence in rows of three (see links) suggests that after a(64) its behavior becomes regular, with each value of a(n) appearing 9 times in 3 contiguous columns of 3 (see conjectured formula).

%F A263104 a(n) = floor((n +4*(n%3)-1)/9) for n >= 65 (conjectured).
%e A263104 For k=6 there are three possible arrangements:
%e A263104    1,1,4: 40 cycles,
%e A263104    1,2,3: 28 cycles(*),
%e A263104    2,2,2: 33 cycles,
%e A263104 so a(18,19,20) = 1,2,3.
