%N A263792 "Shuffled bisection" of positive even and odd numbers, Type 2 (see "Comments" for rules generating the sequence).
%C A263792 All terms are positive, with even and odd terms appearing in due course in order. One might think of the sequence as the result of two poorly-shuffled decks of cards with numbers in increasing order -- one deck with all the positive even numbers and one with all the positive odd numbers, following this set of rules:
%C A263792 Start with a(1)=1; take next odd number until preceding an odd composite, then take next even number. Take next odd unless coprime to last term, otherwise take next even. Repeat indefinitely.
%C A263792 Odd terms precede primes (by definition); primes are followed by even terms unless smallest twin prime.
%C A263792 Excluding a(1)..a(4), the maximum length of odd strings is 3. Is there a limit to the maximum length of even strings?
%C A263792 Same as A263411(n), n<=25.
%C A263792 If seeds are a(1)=1 and a(2)=2, the sequences converge after a(17).

%e A263792 a(11)=17; since next odd is prime, take a(12)=19. Since next odd is composite, take next even, so a(13)=6. Since next odd (21) is not coprime to 6, take a(14)=8. Since 21 is coprime to 8, take a(15)=21.
