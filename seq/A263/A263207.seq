%N A263207 Number of integer solutions for Product_{k=1..n}(c(k) + 1) = 2 * Product_{k=1..n}(c(k) - 1) with 1 < c(k) <= c(k+1).
%C A263207 Geometrically interpreted, the sequence a(n) provides the number of distinct ways to cut an n-dimensional cube orthogonally into equally many outer parts, i.e., those that can be seen from the outside, and inner parts. All cuts must go through the whole body. c(k) is the number of cuts for the k-th dimension.
%C A263207 See section Example for all solutions for n=1 and n=2 and section Links for all solutions for n=3, n=4, n=5.
%C A263207 For any n>=1 the solution given by c(k)=A204321(k) for k=1..n-1 and c(n)=A204321(n)-1 always exists. Conjecture: there is no solution with a greater c(n). - _Martin Janecke_, Dec 01 2015
%C A263207 From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Dec 01 2015: (Start)
%C A263207 In terms of the j-th elementary symmetric functions sigma(n, j) in the indeterminates [c(1), ..., c[n]] the equation with the products can be rewritten as Sum_{j=0..n} ((1 - 2*(-1)^(n-j))*sigma(n, j) = 0, with sigma(n, 0) = 1.
%C A263207 If one uses the reciprocals x(k) = 1/c(k) then
%C A263207   0 < x(k+1) <= x(k) <  1 (the c's are all >1, and finite), and the original equation becomes (by taking logarithms)
%C A263207   Sum_{k=1..n} arctanh(x(k)) = log(2)/2 = arctanh(1/3), (which  is about .35).
%C A263207   Here only positive terms appear. It is clear from the monotony of arctanh that all the x(k) < 1/3 for n >= 2, hence c(1) >= 4 for n >= 2.

%e A263207 a(1) = 1, because there is exactly one solution: c(1) = 3.
%e A263207 a(2) = 2, because there are two solutions: c(1) = 4, c(2) = 11 and c(1) = 5, c(2) = 7. The first solution can be illustrated geometrically as a square cut into thirty outer and equally many inner parts:
