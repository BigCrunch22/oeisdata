%N A139318 a(n) = (A139317(n)-1)/n.
%e A139318 For A139317(7) we check: 7*1 +1= 8, which is not coprime to A139317(1)=2. 7*2 +1= 15, which is not coprime to either A139317(2)=3 or to A139317(4)=5. 7*3 +1 = 22, which is not coprime to either A139317(1)=2 or to A139317(5)=11. But 7*4+1 = 29, which is coprime to terms A139317(1) through A139317(6). So a(7) = 4.
