%N A139476 Positions of squares in the EKG sequence (A064413).
%C A139476 Conjecture: the squares appear in increasing order.
%C A139476 It appears after inspecting 40000 terms that all the n-th powers (squares, cubes, etc.) appear in increasing order. - _Jacques Tramu_, May 10 2008
%C A139476 The conjecture is false; in the EKG sequence, 158^2 is at position 24142, but 157^2 is at position 24146. Note that 157 is prime. If we let p=157, then the two terms on either side of p^2 are p(p+2) and p(p+3), which is unusual because for all primes 3 < p < 157, the three terms are p(p+1), p^2, p(p+2). The next unusual prime is 661. There are no others less than 8164.

%e A139476 The position of 2^2 = 4 is 3 - the second term in the sequence.
%e A139476 The position of 3^2 = 9 is 6 - the third term in the sequence.
