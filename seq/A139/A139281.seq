%N A139281 If all digits are the same mod 3, stop; otherwise write down the number formed by the 1 mod 3 digits and the number formed by the 2 mod 3 digits and the number formed by the 3 mod 3 digits and multiply them; repeat.
%C A139281 Modulo 3 analog of A059707. The 1 mod 3 digits = {1,4,7}, 2 mod 3 digits = {2,5,8}, 3 mod 3 digits = {0, 3, 6, 9}. The fixed points begin: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 17, 22, 25, 28, 30, 33, 36, 39, 41, 44, 47, 52, 55, 58.
%e A139281 a(57) = 5 because 5 and 7 are different mod 3, so 5*7 = 35; 3 and 5 are different mod 3, so 3*5 = 15; 1 and 5 are different mod 3, so 1*5 = 5, which is a fixed point.
%Y A139281 Cf. A010872, A059707, A059708, A059717.
