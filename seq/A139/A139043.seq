%N A139043 Sum of the composite numbers <= 10^n.
%C A139043 Conjecture: 10^n(10^n+1)/2 - 1 -(10^n)^2/(2*log(10^n)-1) -> a(n) as n -> infinity. Here (10^n)^2/(2*log(10^n)-1) is also conjectured to -> sum of primes < 10^n and is a very good approximation for the sum of primes < 10^n. We know that k^2/(2log(k)-1) diverges as k -> infinity. So if we can prove this limit approaches the sum of the primes <= k, then this implies the sum of primes is infinite and therefore the number of primes is infinite.
