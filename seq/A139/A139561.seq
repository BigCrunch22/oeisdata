%N A139561 Growth function for the relatively free monoid on three generators with identity xyzyx = yxzxy.
%C A139561 A semigroup which satisfies the identity xyzyx=yxzxy is called nilpotent of class 2 in the Malcev sense. Initially this sequence looks very like A140348, which counts the words that are distinct in the free nil-2 group.
%C A139561 The sequences first differ at n=7, where there are six equations that hold for the group but do not follow from the Malcev identity, e.g. abccaab = caabbca. Cancellation is not assumed and does not hold, so despite the fact that the former equation does not follow from the Malcev identity, aabccaab = acaabbca does follow.
%C A139561 Shneerson has shown that this sequence grows roughly like some power of n^logn . Contrast to A140348, which has polynomial growth.

%e A139561 Substituting x->a, y->b, z->1 in the identity gives abba=baab, this is the smallest example.
%e A139561 Substituting x->ab, y->b, z->c in the identity gives abbcbab=babcabb.
%Y A139561 Cf. A140348.
%K A139561 nonn
