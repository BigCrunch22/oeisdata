%N A139623 Table read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of directed multigraphs with loops and no vertex of degree 0, with n arcs and k vertices, which are transitive (the existence of a path between two points implies the existence of an arc between those two points).
%C A139623 Length of the n^th row: 2n.
%C A139623 T(n,1) = T(n,2n) = 1 and T(n,2n-1) = 3 if n>1.
