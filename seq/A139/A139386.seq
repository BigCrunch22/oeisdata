%N A139386 First gap of length at least n in A007950, lower end.
%C A139386 All terms of A007950 are odd, therefore all gaps in A007950 have odd length and a(2*k) = a(2*k+1) for k >= 1.
%C A139386 a(22) > 10^11. - Donovan Johnson
%e A139386 First few terms of A007950 are 1,3,5,9,11, ... . The first gap of length 1 is between 1 and 3, so a(1) = 1; the first gap of length 2 is between 5 and 9; it has length 3, so a(2) = a(3) = 5.
%Y A139386 Cf. A007950, A138845, A138900, A139387.
