%N A139210 Number of recursively 3-palindromic words of length n over an alphabet of 2 letters.
%C A139210 We define a word of length n to be recursively 3-palindromic if it is empty, or it is a palindrome and its left third and right third of lengths Floor[n/3] and the remaining middle of length n-2Floor[n/3] are all recursively 3-palindromic.
%C A139210 See the Ji/Wilf reference for the definition of a recursively palindromic sequence. The number of recursively palindromic words of length n over an alphabet of 2 letters is given in A001316.

%F A139210 a(1)=2, a(2)=2 and, for n>2, a(n)=a([n/3])*a(n-2[n/3])., where [...] denotes the floor or greatest integer function.
%e A139210 {0,0,0,0,0,0,0}, {0,0,0,1,0,0,0}, {0,0,1,0,1,0,0}, {0,0,1,1,1,0,0}, {1,1,0,0,0,1,1}, {1,1,0,1,0,1,1}, {1,1,1,0,1,1,1}, {1,1,1,1,1,1,1} are the eight recursively 3-palindromic words of length seven over an alphabet of two letters, so a(7)=8.
