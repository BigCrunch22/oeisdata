%N A139719 A number m is included if k + m/k divides m for at least one divisor k of m.
%C A139719 All terms are even. All even perfect squares are included. If m is included, then 4m is also included.
%C A139719 Also the set of all numbers m of the form m = r*s*(r+s)^2*t^2 with positive integers r,s,t; if one additionally requires (r,s) = 1 and r <= s, then there is exactly one such representation for each m. [From _Hagen von Eitzen_, Jul 22 2009]

%e A139719 72 is included because 6 is a divisor of 72 and (6 + 72/6) = 18 divides 72.
