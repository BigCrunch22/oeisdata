%N A139123 Successive sequences whose numbers and their differences of increasing rank include all numbers (generalization of A005228).
%C A139123 The condition 2) imposes, for any k, 2 and 4 for values of the first two k-th differences and hence 2^1 to 2^(1+k) for the (1+k) first differences and finally (2^n)-1 for values of k(n){n;1;k+2).
%C A139123 In conclusion, in the limit, the terms of the sequence r(k) will be when k tends to infinity = inf(n) = 2^n - 1 (1,3,7,15,31,63,127,255,511,...).
%e A139123 Construct the following array where the sequence k(n) of the k-th row is the unique one 1) whose numbers and their k-th differences include exactly all numbers once 2) where both of the sequence and the sequence of their k-th differences are increasing:
