%N A139783 Quadruple lucky numbers (lower terms). Numbers n such that n, n+2, n+6, n+8 are all Lucky numbers.
%C A139783 Weisstein comments: "the frequency of twin primes and twin lucky numbers are similar." This is to lucky numbers A000959 and A031158 Twin lucky numbers (lower terms) as prime numbers A000040 and A001359 Lesser of twin primes are to A007530 Prime quadruples: numbers n such that n, n+2, n+6, n+8 are all prime.
