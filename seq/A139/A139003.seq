%N A139003 Number of operations A000142 (i.e., x!) or A000196 (i.e., floor(sqrt(x))) needed to get n, starting with 3.
%C A139003 Knuth conjectured that any number can be obtained in that way, starting from 4.
%C A139003 This seems also to be true using 3 as the starting value. Since 3 is the minimal possible choice, this variant could be considered to be more natural.
%C A139003 To ensure the sequence is well-defined, define a(n)=-1 if it is not possible to get n in the given way.
%C A139003 See A139004 for references and links.
%C A139003 In fact a single 2 is enough to get any positive integer, if Knuth's conjecture that one 4 is enough is true. From 2, (((-tan(2.))!)!)! = 5.592..., then floor, factorial gets 120, then sqrt, sqrt gives 3.162..., and floor gives 3, or negate, floor, negate gives 4. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 26 2025

%e A139003 Representing the operation x -> floor(sqrt(x)) by "s" and x -> x! by "f",
%e A139003 we have:
%e A139003 a(1) = 1 since 1 = s3 is clearly the shortest way to obtain 1 from 3.
%e A139003 a(2) = 2 since 2 = sf3 is clearly the shortest way to obtain 2 from 3.
%e A139003 a(3) = 0 since no operation is required to get 3 which is there at the beginning.
%e A139003 a(5) = 4 since 5 = ssff3 is the shortest way to obtain 5 from 3.
%e A139003 a(6) = 1 since 6 = f3 is certainly the shortest way to get 6 from 3.
%e A139003 a(4) = 20 = 7+9+a(5) since 4 = ssssssfsssssssffssff3 = floor(35!^(1/2^6)), 35 = floor((5!)!^(1/2^7)).
