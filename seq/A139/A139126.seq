%N A139126 Least k such that the last n decimal digits of 2^k are all powers of 2.
%C A139126 Does k exist for all n? This sequence is inspired by A130693, which lists all known powers of 2 whose digits are all powers of 2 (that is, 1, 2, 4, or 8).
%e A139126 2^19=524288 is the least power of 2 ending with 5 digits that are powers of 2.
