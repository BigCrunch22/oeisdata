%N A248128 Start with a(0)=50, then a(n) = three times the n-th digit of the sequence, for all n > 0.
%C A248128 The terms in between 0's in the sequence converge "from right to left" to a limiting sequence ...,18,6,3,6,21,27,9,3,15,0. This sequence is listed in A248129. Sequence A248130 lists the individual digits, starting from some 0 and going to the left (until another 0 would be reached); they are equal to A248129/3.
%C A248128 It seems natural to use offset 0 to have the initial term equal to a(0) and a(n) directly related to the n-th digit of the sequence.
%C A248128 All terms a(n) with index n>0 are divisible by 3, the sequence a(n)/3 is nothing else than the individual digits of this sequence.

%e A248128 a(0)=50 by definition, a(1) = 15 = 3*5 (= 3 x the 1st digit of "50"), a(2) = 0 = 3*0 (3 x the 2nd digit of "50,15"), a(3) = 3 = 3*1 (= 3 x the 3rd digit of the sequence which is the 1st digit of a(1) and equals 1).
