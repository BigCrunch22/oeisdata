%N A248129 The limiting sequence of terms preceding the 0's in A248128.
%C A248129 It can be shown that the terms in between two 0's of sequence A248128 consist of some additional terms followed by the preceding chunk of terms delimited by two 0's. This means that this sequence has a limit "from right to left", equal to ...,27,3,24,18,9,18,6,3,6,21,27,9,3,15,0. The present sequence lists this limiting sequence, starting with the rightmost term.
%C A248129 It seems natural to take the offset equal to 0, cf formula.
%C A248129 By construction of A248128, all terms are divisible by 3; A248129(n) = a(n)/3 yields the n-th *digit* preceding a 0 in A248128.
%F A248129 a(n) = A248128(m-n) if A248128(m) = 0 and A248128(m-k) > 0 for all 0 < k <= n.
