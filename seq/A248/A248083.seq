%N A248083 Subsequence of lesser of 2 terms of A095301 that are 2 apart.
%C A248083 A095301 lists integers that have a smaller friend, that is, there exists a smaller integer with same abundancy, sigma(x)/x. In A095301 there are terms with a difference of 2, motivating this sequence.
%e A248083 5850 is in the sequence because 5850 and 5852, that differ by 2, are both in A095301. That is, for both X=5850 and Y=5852, there exists 2 smaller z (x and y) such that sigma(z)/z = sigma(Z)/Z: 300 and 1254.
%Y A248083 Cf. A095301, A248084 (similar, with 3 consecutive terms).
