%N A248806 Number of 2's separating successive 1's in the Kolakoski sequence A000002.
%C A248806 Without the zeros, this sequence is equal to the bisection of the Kolakoski sequence A100429 = lengths of runs of 2's in OK sequence.
%C A248806 The Oldenburger-Kolakovski sequence can be obtained back (except the initial 1) by the following substitution rules: insert 1 between two successive nonzero values and 0 -> 11, 1 -> 2, 2 -> 22.
