%N A248108 Areas of primitive Heronian triangles K which are perfect squares.
%C A248108 It is known that every positive integer is the area of some rational triangle. Hence for every n > 0 there exists at least one primitive Heronian triangle with area K such that n*k^2 = K for some positive integer k. Therefore for the integer 1 there exists primitive Heronian triangles with area K = k^2. This sequence identifies all such occurrences of square areas from lists of primitive Heronian triangles generated by _Sascha Kurz_ (see link). The sequence excludes repetitive terms and is exhaustive as the Kurz lists searched include all primitive Heronian triangles up to a maximum side length of 6000000 and this sequence only includes areas that do not exceed 6000000 (see _T. D. Noe_ comments at A083875). All 46 terms found are displayed. It is conjectured that this sequence is infinite.

%e A248108 The first term 36 corresponds to the 5th term of A083875, 6 (area/6).
%e A248108 a(14) = 298116 = 546^2. There are two such Heronian triangles; they have sides (1183,865,696) and (7202,4395,2809).
