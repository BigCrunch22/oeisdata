%N A248625 Lexicographically earliest sequence of nonnegative integers such that no triple (a(n),a(n+d),a(n+2d)) is in arithmetic progression, for any d>0, n>=0.
%C A248625 The sequence is constructed in the greedy way, appending at each step the least nonnegative integer such that no subsequence of equidistant terms contains an AP.
%C A248625 Every nonnegative integer seems to appear in this sequence - see A248627 for the corresponding indices.
%C A248625 Sequence A229037 is the analog for positive integers (and indices).
%F A248625 a(n) = A229037(n+1)+1.
%e A248625 Start with a(0)=a(1)=0, smallest possible choice and trivially satisfying the constraint since no 3-term subsequence is possible.
%e A248625 Then one must take a(2)=1 since otherwise [0,0,0] would be an AP.
%e A248625 Then one can take again a(3)=a(4)=0, and a(5)=1.
%e A248625 Now appending 0 would yield the AP (0,0,0) by extracting terms with indices 0,3,6; therefore a(6)=1.
%e A248625 Now a(7) cannot be 0 not 1 nor 2 since else a(3)=0, a(5)=1, a(7)=2 would be an AP, therefore a(7)=3 is the least possible choice.
