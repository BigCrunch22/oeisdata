%N A248162 Partition number array: sum of part*(part - 1) for each partition of n in Abramowitz-Stegun order for n >= 1.
%C A248162 The row length sequence is A000041.
%C A248162 The partitions of n are sorted by increasing number of parts m and lexicographically within the same part number (Abramowitz-Stegun or Hindenburg order; see the Apr 04 2011 _Wolfdieter Lang_ comment at A036036). The j-th partition of n with m parts is denoted by p(n,m,j) with j = 1, ..., A008284(n,m). In the tabf version used here the k-th partition of n in the mentioned order is p(n,k) with k from 1 to A000041(n). A partition of n with m parts is denoted by (n_1, n_2, ..., n_m) with nondecreasing entries.
%C A248162 The present partition numbers a(n,m,j) appear in the problem of finding the probability P(n,m,j) of having a pair of one color after picking two balls from a box of n balls coming in m distinct colors with n_l balls of color type c_l for l = 1, 2, ..., m. This probability is P(n,m,j) = a(n,m,j)/(n*(n-1)).
%C A248162 This entry is motivated by the Maslanka puzzle Nr. 4, in The Guardian Weekly, Vol. 191, No 21, date 31.10.14, p. 44, solution p. 47. There the example with partition (3,4,5) and a(12,3,11) = a(12,18) = 3*2 + 4*3 + 5*4 = 38 with P(12,18) = 38/(12*11) = 19/66 has been considered.

%F A248162 a(n,k) = Sum_{l=1..m} n_l(k)*(n_l(k)-1) if the k-th partition of n in Abramowitz-Stegun order is (n_1(k), n_2(k), ..., n_m(k)), with n >= 1 and k = 1, 2, ..., A000041(n).
