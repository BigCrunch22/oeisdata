%N A248980 One fifth the hypotenuse of primitive Pythagorean triangles (PPT's) whose hypotenuse is the only side that is divisible by primes of the form 4k+1 (sorted and repetitions omitted).
%C A248980 If only one side of a PPT is divisible by primes of the form 4k+1 that side is the hypotenuse. Furthermore this hypotenuse is divisible by 5 because all PPT's must have at least one side divisible by 5. However this is only a necessary condition. It is not sufficient. For instance, PPT's can share the same hypotenuse divisible by 5, some will have no other side divisible by primes of the form 4k+1 and others will. E.g. PPT's (16,63,65) and (33,56,65) so 13 is in the sequence.
%C A248980 Also an identical sequence is generated from the superset of primitive Heronian triangles if only one side is divisible by primes of the form 4k+1 and this side is divided by 5 (see Yiu link).

%e A248980 a(1)=1 as (3,4,5) is the first PPT where only the hypotenuse is divisible by primes of the form 4k+1, whereas the PPT (5,12,13) has two sides and the PPT (39,80,89) has three sides divisible by primes of the form 4k+1.
