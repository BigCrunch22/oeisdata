%N A248927 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) are the coefficients of the Lagrange (compositional) inversion of a function in terms of the Taylor series expansion of its reciprocal, n >= 1, k = 1..A000041(n-1).
%C A248927 Coefficients are listed in reverse graded colexicographic order (A228100). This is the reverse of Abramowitz and Stegun order (A036036).
%C A248927 Coefficients for Lagrange (compositional) inversion of a function in terms of the Taylor series expansion of its shifted reciprocal. Complementary to A134264 for formal power series. A refinement of A141618 with row sums A000272.
%C A248927 Given an invertible function f(t) analytic about t=0 with f(0)=0 and df(0)/dt not 0, form h(t) = t / f(t) and denote h_n = (n') as the coefficient of t^n/n! in h(t). Then the compositional inverse of f(t), g(t), as a formal Taylor series, or e.g.f., is given up to the first few orders by

%C A248927 From _Tom Copeland_, Oct 28 2014: (Start)
%C A248927 Expressing g(t) as a Taylor series or formal e.g.f. in the indeterminates h_n generates a refinement of A055302, which enumerates the number of labeled root trees with n nodes and k leaves, with row sum A000169.
%C A248927 Operating with (1/n^2) d/d(1') = (1/n^2) d/d(h_1) on the n-th partition polynomial in square brackets above associated with t^n/n! generates the (n-1)-th partition polynomial.
%C A248927 Multiplying the n-th partition polynomial here by (n + 1) gives the (n + 1)-th partition polynomial of A248120.  (End)
%C A248927 These are also the coefficients in the expansion of a series related to the Lagrange reversion theorem presented in Wikipedia of which the Lagrange inversion formula about the origin is a special case. Cf. Copeland link. - _Tom Copeland_, Nov 01 2016

%F A248927 For j>1, there are P(j,m;a...) = j! / [ (j-m)! (a_1)! (a_2)! ... (a_(j-1))! ] permutations of h_0 through h_(j-1) in which h_0 is repeated (j-m) times; h_1, repeated a_1 times; and so on with a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_(j-1) = m.
%F A248927 If, in addition, a_1 + 2 * a_2 + ... + (j-1) * a_(j-1) = j-1, then each distinct combination of these arrangements is correlated with a partition of j-1.
%F A248927 T(j,k) is [(j-1)!/j]* P(j,m;a...) / [(2!)^a_2 (3!)^a_3 ... ((j-1)!)^a_(j-1) ] for the k-th partition of j-1. The partitions are in reverse order--from bottom to top--from the order in Abramowitz and Stegun (page 831).
%F A248927 For example, from g(t) above, T(6,3) = [5!/6][6!/(3!*2!)]/(2!)^2 = 300 for the 3rd partition from the bottom under n=6-1=5 with m=3 parts, and T(6,5) = [5!/6][6!/4!]/(2!*3!) = 50.
%F A248927 If the initial factorial and final denominator are removed and the partitions reversed in order, A134264 is obtained, a refinement of the Narayana numbers.
%F A248927 For f(t) = t*e^(-t), g(t) = T(t), the Tree function, which is the e.g.f. of A000169, and h(t) = t/f(t) = e^t, so h_n = 1 for all n in this case; therefore, the row sums of A248927 are A000169(n)/n = n^(n-2) = A000272(n).
%F A248927 Let W(x) = 1/(df(x)/dx)= 1/{d[x/h(x)]/dx}=1/{d[x/[h_0+h_1*x+ ...]]/dx}. Then the partition polynomials above are given by (1/n)(W(x)*d/dx)^n x, evaluated at x=0, and the compositional inverse of f(t) is g(t)= exp(t*W(x)*d/dx) x, evaluated at x=0. Also, dg(t)/dt = W(g(t)). See A145271.
%F A248927 With exp[x* PS(.,t)] = exp[t*g(x)]=exp[x*W(y)d/dy] exp(t*y) eval. at y=0, the raising (creation) and lowering (annihilation) operators defined by R PS(n,t) = PS(n+1,t) and L PS(n,t)= n * PS(n-1,t) are R = t * W(d/dt) and L =(d/dt)/h(d/dt)=(d/dt) 1/[(h_0)+(h_1)*d/dt+(h_2)*(d/dt)^2/2!+...], which will give a lowering operator associated to the refined f-vectors of permutohedra (cf. A133314 and A049019).
%F A248927 Then  [dPS(n,z)/dz]/n  eval. at z=0 are the row partition polynomials of this entry. (Cf. A139605, A145271, and link therein to Mathemagical Forests for relation to planted trees on p. 13.)
%F A248927 As noted in A248120 and A134264, this entry is given by the Hadamard product by partition of A134264 and A036038. For example, (1,4,2,6,1)*(1,4,6,12,24) = (1,16,12,72,24). - _Tom Copeland_, Nov 25 2016
%F A248927 T(n,k) = ((n-1)!)^2/((n-j)!*Product_{i>=1} s_i!*(i!)^s_i), where (1*s_1 + 2*s_2 + ... = n-1) is the k-th partition of n-1 and j = s_1 + s_2 ... is the number of parts. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Feb 02 2022
