%N A248865 Primes p that set a new record for the number of bases 1 < b < p for which p is a base-b Wieferich prime.
%C A248865 Primes p where A242830(i) reaches record values, where i is the index of p in A000040.
%C A248865 The corresponding number of bases are 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12. - _Jianing Song_, Feb 07 2019
%C A248865 From _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Sep 06 2020: (Start)
%C A248865 Note that for a(6) and a(7), all the b values (bases) that are counted are powers of 2; and for a(8) all are powers of 3.
%C A248865 See A334048 for a version where bases b that are powers are not allowed.
%C A248865 One candidate for a(9) is 1645333507; it has 14 bases, the first 13 of which are powers of 5. However, excluding all numbers under 1645333507 as candidates for a(9) may be difficult to do.
