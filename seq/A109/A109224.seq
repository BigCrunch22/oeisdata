%N A109224 Minimum number of moves to solve the second Panex puzzle of order n of exchanging the two side towers.
%C A109224 Conjecture: for n >= 5, a(n) = ((7/2) * (7 - (4 * sqrt(2))) * (1 + sqrt(2))^n) - (8 * n) - 2 + ((7/2) * (7 + (4 * sqrt(2))) * (1 - sqrt(2))^n). Confirmed to n = 13, and known to be an upper bound for all larger n.
