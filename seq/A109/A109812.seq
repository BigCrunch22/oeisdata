%C A109812 Theorem: Sequence is a permutation of the positive integers. - _Leroy Quet_, Aug 16 2005
%C A109812 Proof: It is clear that the sequence is infinite. The first time a number >= 2^k appears (for k>1), it must BE 2^k, and is therefore immediately followed by the smallest missing number. Since there are infinitely many powers of 2, every number will eventually appear. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jun 02 2018, rewritten Apr 03 2022
%C A109812 The sequence should really begin with a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, etc., and be defined simply as "the lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of nonnegative numbers such that the binary expansions of adjacent terms are disjoint". There is also an obvious equivalent definition as a sequence of subsets of the nonnegative integers such that successive subsets are disjoint. But for historical reasons we will keep the present definition. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 04 2022
%C A109812 Inverse permutation = A113233; A113232 = a(a(n)). - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Oct 19 2005
%C A109812 Sequence of fixed points, where a(n) = n, is A340016. - _Thomas Scheuerle_, Dec 24 2020
%C A109812 Comment from _Rémy Sigrist_, Apr 04 2022 [added by _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 06 2022]: (Start)
%C A109812 If we compare the log scatterplots of the even and odd bisections of this sequence, usually everything is scrambled, but on some large intervals the bisections appear as two parallel stripes.
%C A109812 On these intervals, for some constant k,
%C A109812 - one bisection has values of the form 2^k + something < 2^(k-1)
%C A109812 - the other bisection has values < 2^(k-1).
%C A109812 This is shown in the pair of Sigrist "The two bisections" links. (End)
%C A109812 Comment from _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 06 2022: (Start)
%C A109812 Near Gavarnie France there is a gap in the wall of the Pyrenees known as the Brèche de Roland. The graph of the present sequence shows a sequence of very similar gaps or brèches, at slightly irregular intervals.
%C A109812 It is hoped that if the positions of these brèches can be identified, this will provide a key to the structure of this mysterious sequence.
%C A109812 If the reader clicks the "graph" button here, the top graph shows an obvious brèche between n=59 and n=71. This is also shown in one of the links below.
%C A109812 [More information about the positions of the brèches will be added here soon.] (End)
%C A109812 If a(m) AND a(n) = a(m) then m <= n. - _Rémy Sigrist_, Apr 04 2022
%C A109812 It appears that a(n)/n is bounded (it is probably less than 4 for all n), and n/a(n) is unbounded. See A352336, A352359, A352917-A352923 and the conjectures therein. - _David Broadhurst_, Apr 17 2022
%C A109812 This is also a lookup-table for a strategy of the 2-player 2-heap misere-Nim game (where a winning position is indicated by a XOR Nim-sum of the 2 heaps equal to zero). See e.g. A048833. - _R. J. Mathar_, Apr 29 2022
%C A109812 The set-theory analog of A093714 is essentially the same sequence as this. The definition is: b(0)=0; thereafter b(n+1) = smallest missing nonnegative integer which is different from b(n)+1 and whose binary expansion has no 1-bit in common with the binary expansion of b(n). This begins 0, 2, 1, 4, 3, 8, ..., and b(n) = a(n) for n > 2. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 07 2022

%F A109812 It would be nice to have a formula or recurrence. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jun 02 2018
%F A109812 From _M. F. Hasler_, Apr 03 2022: (Start)
%F A109812 (1) If a(n) = 2^k and a(m) > 2^k then m > n: No term larger than 2^k can occur earlier than 2^k.
%F A109812 (2) For all k >= 0, a(n) = 2^k for some n <= 2^k: Any power of two will occur, not later than immediately after all smaller numbers.
%F A109812 (3) If a(n) = 2^k, and S(k) = {x < 2^k | x <> a(j) for all j < n} is not empty (which seems to be the case for all k > 1), then a(n+1) = min S(k): The smallest number less than a power of two that does not occur before it must occur immediately after it.
%F A109812 (4) If a(n) = 2^k with n < 2^k (probably true for all k > 1), then a(n+1) = min {x | x <> a(j) for all j <= n}. (End)
%e A109812 a(6) = 5, which is 101 in binary. Of the terms not among (1,2,4,3,8,5), the earlier terms of the sequence, 10 (decimal) = 1010 (binary) is the smallest positive integer with no common 1-bits with the binary representation of 5.
%e A109812 Of the other positive integers not occurring earlier in the sequence (6 = 110 binary, 7 = 111 binary, 9 = 1001 binary), each has at least one 1-bit in common with 5 = 101 in binary.
%e A109812 So a(7) = 10.
%e A109812 To illustrate the formulas (3) & (4): The powers of two a(3) = 4, a(5) = 8, a(8) = 16, and a(15) = 32 are immediately followed by 3, 5, 6 and 7, respectively, which are the smallest numbers that did not occur earlier. - _M. F. Hasler_, Apr 03 2022
