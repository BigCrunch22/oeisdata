%N A109054 Squares and numbers k such that the continued fraction expansion of sqrt(k) is multiplicative.
%C A109054 If we consider each square k as having a continued fraction expansion c of all zeros after c(0) = sqrt(k)-1, then the continued fraction expansion of sqrt(k) for each square is trivially multiplicative.
%C A109054 For nonsquares, c(1) must be 1 and so k must satisfy m + 1/2 < sqrt(k) <= m+1, for some integer m.
%e A109054 The continued fraction of sqrt(22) is c = (4; 1, 2, 4, 2, 1, 8, ...) = A010126, which is multiplicative with c(2^e) = 2, c(3^e) = 4, c(p^e) = 1 otherwise.
%Y A109054 Union of A000290 and A108575.
%Y A109054 Continued fraction expansions: A040001, A010121, A040005, etc.
