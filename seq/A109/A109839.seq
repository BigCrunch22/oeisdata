%e A109839 a(6) = 16400 because -6 = -210 + 180 + 24 = ((-1)^1)*1*210 + ((-1)^0)*6*30 + ((-1)^0)*4*6 + ((-1)^1)*0*2 + ((-1)^1)*0*1, where 1,1,0,0,1 are the first five terms of A004601 and 1,2,6,30,210 are the first five terms of A002110.
%Y A109839 Cf. A109838 (nonnegative integers represented similarly), A004601 (Pi in binary), A002110 (primorials), A049345 (primorial base).
