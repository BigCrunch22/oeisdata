%N A109136 Even numbers that are not congruent to 1 mod 3 nor are squares nor are the sum of a prime and a square of a prime.
%C A109136 We conjecture that every sufficiently large even number is congruent to 1 mod 3, or is a square, or is a sum of a prime and a square of a prime. The numbers listed here are believed to be the only exceptions. This has been verified up to 100000000.
