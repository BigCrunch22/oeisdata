%N A109338 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = number of inequivalent binary sequences of length n and weight k, where two sequences are said to be equivalent if they have the same set of phrases in their Ziv-Lempel encodings (the phrases can appear in a different order in the two sequences).
%C A109338 The Ziv-Lempel encoding scans the sequence from left to right and inserts a comma when the current phrase is an extension by one bit of an earlier phrase. In any case the scan ends with a comma. The phrases are the segments between the commas.
%C A109338 Equivalent sequences necessarily have the same Hamming weight.
