%N A109943 Maximal number of distinct primes in the solution of the n X n generalization of the Gordon Lee puzzle.
%C A109943 The Gordon Lee puzzle asks for an n X n array of single digits such that as many distinct primes as possible are formed by joining consecutive digits in any horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction, forward or backward. a(4)=63 was proved in March 2005 by Mike Oakes. a(5) and a(6) are conjectured best values that resisted any improvement since 1998.
%C A109943 a(5), a(6) and a(7) are conjectured best values that have resisted any improvement since 1998, including the joint effort of more than 100 participants in a programming contest in summer 2005. The best currently (September 2005) known lower bounds for the next terms are a(8)>=394 and a(9)>=527. - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Sep 21 2005
