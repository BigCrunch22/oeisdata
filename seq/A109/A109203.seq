%N A109203 Minimal value of k>0 such that n^8 + k^2 is a semiprime.
%C A109203 There seems to be a modest correlation with the n^7 sequence (A109202) with often the same values [n = 10,16,18,23,31,45,52,55,66,72,82,88,100]. Sometimes the same value of k occurs for the n^6 sequence (A109201), the n^7 sequence (A109202) and this n^8 sequence, for instance n=88, k=5. The statistics of these sequences is unclear, as are the asymptotics.
%e A109203 a(0) = 2 because 0^8 + 1^2 = 1 is not semiprime, but 0^8 + 2^2 = 4 = 2^2 is.
%e A109203 a(1) = 3 because 1^8 + 1^2 and 1^8 + 2^2 are not semiprime, but 1^8 + 3^2 = 10 = 2 * 5 is semiprime.
%e A109203 a(2) = 3 because 2^8 + 3^2 = 265 = 5 * 53 is semiprime, but 2^8 + 1^2 and 2^8 + 2^2 are not semiprimes.
%e A109203 a(90) = 41 because 90^8 + 41^2 = 4304672100001681 = 6317 * 681442472693 and for no smaller k>0 is 90^8 + k^2 a semiprime.
%e A109203 a(100) = 9 because 100^8 + 9^2 = 10000000000000081 = 34361 * 291027618521 and for no smaller k>0 is 100^8 + k^2 a semiprime.
