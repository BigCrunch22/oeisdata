%F A109382 a(n) = LD(nameof(n), nameof(n+1)).
%e A109382 a(0) = 4 since LD(ZERO,ONE) requires 4 edits.
%e A109382 a(1) = 3 since LD(ONE,TWO) which requires 3 substitutions.
%e A109382 a(2) = 4 since LD(TWO,THREE) = requires 4 edits (leave the leftmost T unchanged), then 2 substitutions (W to H, O to R), then 2 insertions (E,E).
%e A109382 a(4) = 3 as LD(FOUR,FIVE) leaves the leftmost F unchanged, then requires 3 substitutions. From FIVE to SIX leaves the I unchanged. From SIX to SEVEN leaves the S unchanged. From TEN to ELEVEN leaves the EN unchanged. From ELEVEN to TWELVE leaves an E,L,V,E unchanged. From THIRTEEN to FOURTEEN leaves RTEEN unchanged. TWENTYNINE to THIRTY takes 7 edits. THIRTYNINE to FORTY takes 7 edits. SEVENTYNINE to EIGHTY takes 8 edits. EIGHTYNINE to NINETY takes 7 edits. NINETYNINE to ONEHUNDRED takes 7 edits.
