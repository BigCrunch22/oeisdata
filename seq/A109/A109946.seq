%N A109946 Smallest prime starting a complete two iterations Cunningham chain of the first and second kind.
%C A109946 Intersection of A057326 and A059762. The terms have to start a chain through iteration by either <2p+1> or <2p-1> operator (not mixed in the same chain); and the chains has to be three primes long.
%H A109946 Chris Caldwell, The Prime Glossary, <a href="https://t5k.org/glossary/page.php?sort=CunninghamChain">Cunningham chains</a>.
%e A109946 a(1)=2 is here because 2 -> 3 -> 5 through <2p-1> and the chain ends here (with this operator).
%e A109946 a(2)=19 is here because 19 -> 37 -> 73 through <2p-1>.
%e A109946 a(3)=41 is here because 41 -> 83 -> 167 through <2p+1>.
%e A109946 - 11 is not here because it is well followed by two terms, but doesn't start this sequence (2->5->11->23->47).
%e A109946 - 89 is not here because it starts a 6 terms chain.
%Y A109946 Cf. A057326, A059762.
