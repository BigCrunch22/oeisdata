%N A109252 Number of fair sudoku problems with n given values on a 4 x 4 grid.
%C A109252 A problem is 'fair' if the given values are sufficient to resolve the entire grid to a unique Sudoku solution. Since a(16) represents problems in which the whole grid is already given, a(16) is necessarily the same as A107739(2).
%e A109252 An example fair problem with 4 given digits is ?4?2 / ???1 / ???? / ?3??, which has the complete grid 1432 / 3241 / 4123 / 2314 as the only solution. There are 25,728 such fair problems with 4 given digits, so a(4) = 25728.
%Y A109252 Cf. A107739.
