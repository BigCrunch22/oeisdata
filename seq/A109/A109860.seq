%C A109860 2 is the only prime that is not a member. Conjecture: There are finitely many composite terms.
%C A109860 The sequence contains infinitely many composites. Through n rows, there are ~ n^2/2 terms. The number of primes up to (n+1)^2 is ~ n^2/(2 log n), which is eventually quite a bit less. Most products of two nearby primes will be in the sequence. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Apr 14 2006
