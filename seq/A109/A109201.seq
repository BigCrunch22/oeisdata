%N A109201 Minimal value of k>0 such that n^6 + k^2 is a semiprime.
%C A109201 It seems that one or more primes nearly always occur before finding the first such semiprime for a given n. There seems to be a high correlation with the n^5 + k^2 sequence (A109200) [such as n=63] and it with the n^2 + k^2 sequence (A109197).
%F A109201 a(n) = minimal value of k>0 such that n^6 + k^2 is semiprime.
%e A109201 a(0) = 2 because 0^6 + 1^2 = 1 is not semiprime, but 0^6 + 2^2 = 4 = 2^2 is.
%e A109201 a(1) = 3 because 1^6 + 1^2 and 1^6 + 2^2 are not semiprime, but 1^6 + 3^2 = 10 = 2 * 5 is semiprime.
%e A109201 a(2) = 1 because 2^6 + 1^2 = 65 = 5 * 13 is semiprime.
%e A109201 a(69) = 25 because 69^6 + 25^2 = 107918163706 = 2 * 53959081853 and for no smaller k>0 is 69^6 + k^2 a semiprime.
%e A109201 a(100) = 7 because 100^6 + 7^2 = 1000000000049 = 6337 * 157803377 and for no smaller k>0 is 100^6 + k^2 a semiprime.
