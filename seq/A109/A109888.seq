%N A109888 Sequence with properties that a(1)=1, no prime appears in the sequence or the first differences and all other integers exactly once (in sequence or first differences).
%C A109888 Sequence and first differences are:
%C A109888 1.9.15..25..39..51.55..75..91...
%C A109888 .8.6..10..14..12..4..20..16.. etc.
%e A109888 Start with a(1)=1; what can we add to produce a(2)? Not 1 (already used), not 2 or 3 (primes), not 4 (produces 5, which is prime), not 6 (produces 7, which is prime) -- 8 is ok and produces 9 (1+8) which is not prime, so a(2) =9; what can we add to a(2) to produce a(3)? Not 1, 2 or 3 (see above), not 4 (produces 13, which is prime), not 5 (prime) -- 6 is ok and produces 15 (9+6), which is not prime, so a(3)=15; what can we add to a(3) to produce a(4)? Not 1, 2 and 3 (see above), not 4 (produces 19, which is prime), not 5 (prime), not 6 (already used), not 7 (prime), not 8 or 9 (already used) -- 10 is ok and produces 25 (15+10), which is not prime, so a(4)=25; etc.
