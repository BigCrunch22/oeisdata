%N A109859 Number of terms of A109858 with digit sum n.
%C A109859 Can someone find a formula for the n-th term?
%C A109859 At first a(2n) = a(2n+1) because the palindromes of sum 2n can be placed into one-to-one correspondence with the palindromes of sum 2n+1 by inserting a 1 in the middle (if the number of digits is even) or adding one to the middle digit (if the number of digits is odd). However once there exists a palindrome with middle digit 9, this strategy no longer works. - _Joshua Zucker_, May 05 2006
