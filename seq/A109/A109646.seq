%N A109646 Triangle, read by rows, of the number of different isotemporal classes of rotationally distinct diasters with n (rows) total peripheral edges with k (columns) peripheral edges on one side.
%C A109646 See A092481 for the definition of isotemporal class. A109622 is the sum of rows.

%F A109646 for k=0, a(n, k)=1 for k>0 and n!=k, a(n, k)=(n-k)k+(n-k)+k+1 for k>0 and n=k, a(n, k)=(1/2)(k^2+3k+2)
%e A109646 Row 0 has 1 element, a diaster with no peripheral edges - a singleton edge - for which there is only a single isotemporal class. Row 1 has 1 element, the diaster with a single peripheral edge - two edges sharing a single vertex - for which there is a single isotemporal class. Row 2 has 2 elements, corresponding to the diaster with a two peripheral edges on a single side and the diaster with a single peripheral edge on either side, with 1 and 3 isotemporal classes respectively.
