%N A109601 A puzzle sequence: you are asked to find the next three terms. I know nothing more about it.
%C A109601 William Maness, Oct 24 2011, observes that so far the terms are all odd numbers and the numbers of digits is alternately 2 and 3. Sequence is likely from a book of math puzzles for grade school.
