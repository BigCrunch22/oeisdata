%N A109035 Number of irreducible partitions into squares. A partition is irreducible if no subpartition with 2 or more parts sums to a square.
%C A109035 Sequence is unbounded, as can be seen by considering sums of 2 squares (thanks to _David L. Harden_). Obviously it contains infinitely many 1's, at square indices. At nonsquare indices, series appears to go to infinity, but this is conjecture and growth rate is entirely unknown. Also unknown is whether the sequence is onto the positive integers.
%e A109035 a(10)=1 for the partition [9,1]. [4^2,1^2], [4,1^6] and [1^10] are all excluded because they contain subpartitions [4^2,1] or [1^4] summing to a square.
