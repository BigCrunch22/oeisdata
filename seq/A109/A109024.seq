%N A109024 4-almost primes (A014613) whose digit reversal is different and also has 4 prime factors (with multiplicity).
%C A109024 This sequence is the k = 4 instance of the series which begins with k = 1, k = 2, k = 3 (A109023).

%e A109024 a(1) = 126 is in this sequence because 126 = 2 * 3^2 * 7 is a 4-almost prime and reverse(126) = 621 = 3^3 * 23 is also a 4-almost prime.
%e A109024 a(2) = 225 is in this sequence because 225 = 3^2 * 5^2 is a 4-almost prime and reverse(225) = 522 = 2 * 3^2 * 29 is also a 4-almost prime. That 225 and 522 are concatenated from entirely prime digits is a coincidence, as with 2223).
