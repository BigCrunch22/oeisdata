%N A109799 Primes p such that 2^p - 1 is a Chen prime.
%C A109799 For p in this sequence, 2^p - 1 is called a Mersenne-Chen prime.
%C A109799 Conjecture: 2^127 - 1 is the largest Mersenne-Chen prime.
%C A109799 Except for the initial term 2, this sequence is the intersection of A000043 and A000978 given by A107360. - _Max Alekseyev_, Oct 28 2008, Jan 28 2010
