%N A109871 Number of ways a number can be expressed as the difference of two palindromes, or -1 if this number if infinite.
%C A109871 2 = (10^k+1)-(10^k-1) where (10^k+1) and (10^k-1) are palindromes for all k. 11 = (2*10^k +2)-(2*10^k-9)where (2*10^k+2) and (2*10^k-9) are palindromes for all k. Hence a(2) = a(11)are denoted by -1. Note: terms should be checked for any errors.
%C A109871 The differences that occur infinitely many times are 2 and 11*10^k (k >= 0). - _David Wasserman_, Apr 03 2008
%e A109871 a(2) = a(11) = -1 as 2 and 11 can be so expressed infinitely many times.
%e A109871 a(22) = 9, 22 = 22-0, 33-11, 44-22, 55-33, 66-44, 77-55, 88-66, 99-77, 121-99.
%e A109871 a(22) = 10 because 22 = 22-0, 33-11, 44-22, 55-33, 66-44, 77-55, 88-66, 99-77, 121-99 and 1001-979.
