%N A109619 Smallest prime p such that 2n+p is the square of a prime, or 0 if no such prime exists.
%C A109619 Many of the zeros can be understood: Let p = q^2-2*n, for q prime.  q <= 3 only leads to positive p for n <= 4. For n > 4, q > 3 so q^2 mod 3 = 1, and if n = 2 mod 3 then p = 0 mod 3, so p is either 3 or a multiple of 3.  Thus for n > 4 with n = 2 mod 3, a(n) = 3 or 0, and instances of 3 should become increasingly rare at large n.  Not all zeros are of this form: when 2*n is a square, k^2, then (q^2-2*n)=(q-k)*(q+k) and p cannot be prime unless q-k=1. n=72=(12^2/2) is the first case for which a(n) = 0 and n is not congruent to 2 mod 3.  Possibly all zeros fall into one of these two categories (all those for n<=10^5 do). - _D. S. McNeil_, Nov 24 2010
%e A109619 For n=4, we find that 17+2*4=25=5^2 and no smaller prime than 17 works, so a(4)=17.
%e A109619 For n=5, the 2 mod 3 argument applies and a(5)=3 or 0; but 3+2*5=13 which is not a squared prime, so a(5)=0.
