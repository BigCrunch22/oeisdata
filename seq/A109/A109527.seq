%N A109527 Prague bus clock sequence.
%C A109527 See the sequence as a succession of quadruplets showing the time (in hours and minutes). The sequence starts at midnight (00:00) and ends at 22:51 showing all sound times seen in a lateral mirror (if the clock in the bus indicates 22:51 one will read 15:22 in a lateral window, which is a possible time of the day, thus the quadruplet 2251 belongs to the sequence; the quadruplet 0825 is not in the sequence as 08:25 produces 25:80 in the window). On such a digital clock the only digits which produce another "mirror" digit are 0 (->0), 1 (->1), 2 (->5), 5(->2) and 8(->8). "8" must be discarded in this sequence and "5" carefully used.
