%N A109843 Least multiple of n with digit reversal a prime, or 0 if no such multiple exists.
%C A109843 a(3k) = 0, k > 0.
%C A109843 A subsidiary sequence could be obtained by replacing a(3n) by the least multiple of n which on division by largest power of 3 that divides it gives a number whose digit reversal is prime.
%C A109843 Note also that a(77) = 0. - _Joshua Zucker_, May 04 2006
