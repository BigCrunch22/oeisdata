%N A109891 Least number that requires n steps to reach 0 by repeated application of f: x -> abs(x - reverse(x)).
%C A109891 Coincides with A072138 for the first 14 and many later terms.
%e A109891 f(16) = 61-16 = 45, f(45) = 54-45 = 9, f(9) = 9-9 = 0. For no k < 16 exactly three steps lead to 0, hence a(3) = 16.
%Y A109891 Cf. A072137, A072138, A072141.
