%N A109630 The winning position when playing the "eeny meeny miny moe" game with n players and eliminating every 8th player.
%C A109630 A version of the Josephus sieve - see for example A000960. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 26 2007
%C A109630 In this game, all the children start standing in front of a chair and the teacher will chant "eeny-meeny-miny-moe..." and eliminate every eighth player, who then has to sit down. The game continues until only one child remains standing. He or she is declared the winner.
%C A109630 The multiples of 8 never appear in this sequence because they are always wiped out in the first round.

%F A109630 For n > 5, if a(n-1) + 8 > n, then a(n) = a(n-1) + 8 - n; otherwise, a(n) = a(n-1) + 8.
%e A109630 For n = 4 the winner is the third child because:
%e A109630 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, X (the fourth is eliminated)
%e A109630 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, X (the second is eliminated)
%e A109630 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3, X (the first is eliminated, therefore #3 wins); thus a(4)=3.
