%N A109025 5-almost primes (A014613) whose digit reversal is different and also has 5 prime factors (with multiplicity). "Emirp Tsomla-5."
%C A109025 This sequence is the k = 5 instance of the series which begins with k = 1 (emirps), k = 2 (emirpimes), k = 3 (emirp tsomla-3 = A109023), k = 4 (emirp tsomla-4 = A109024).
%C A109025 The Mathematica code for this was written by Ray Chandler who extended this sequence. He also has more values.

%e A109025 a(2) = 1386 is in this sequence because 1386 = 2 * 3^2 * 7 * 11 is a 5-almost prime and reverse(1386) = 6831 = 3^3 * 11 * 23 is also a 5-almost prime.
%e A109025 5355 is in this sequence because 5355 = 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 17 and reverse(5355) = 5535 = 3^3 * 5 * 41, although it is mere coincidence that 5355 is concatenated from entirely prime digits.
