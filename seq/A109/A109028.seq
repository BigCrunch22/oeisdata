%N A109028 8-almost primes (A046310) whose digit reversal is different and also has 8 prime factors (with multiplicity). "Emirp Tsomla-8.".
%C A109028 This sequence is the k = 8 instance of the series which begins with k = 1 (emirps), k = 2 (emirpimes), k = 3 (emirp tsomla-3 = A109023), k = 4 (emirp tsomla-4 = A109024), k = 5 (emirp tsomla-5 = A109025), k = 6 (emirp tsomla-6 = A109026), k = 7 (emirp tsomla-7 = A109027).
%C A109028 The Mathematica code for this was written by Ray Chandler who extended this sequence. He also has more values.
