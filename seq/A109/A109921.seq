%N A109921 a(2n) = prime(n). a(2n+1) = sum of composite numbers between prime(n) and prime(n+1). We define a(1) = 1.
%C A109921 1 together with the sum of consecutive composites between primes interleaved with the primes. - _Omar E. Pol_, Oct 01 2012
%e A109921 Contribution from _Omar E. Pol_, Oct 06 2012 (Start):
%e A109921 a(1) = 1, by definition. Also 1 is the first nonprime.
%e A109921 a(2) = 2, the first prime.
%e A109921 a(3) = 0, the sum of composite numbers between 2 and 3.
%e A109921 a(4) = 3, the second prime.
%e A109921 a(5) = 4, the sum of the composite numbers between 3 and 5.
%e A109921 a(6) = 5, the third prime.
%e A109921 a(7) = 6, the sum of the composite numbers between 5 and 7.
%e A109921 a(8) = 7, the fourth prime.
%e A109921 a(9) = 27, the sum of the composite numbers between 7 and 11, since 8+9+10 = 27.
%e A109921 a(10) = 11, the fifth prime.
