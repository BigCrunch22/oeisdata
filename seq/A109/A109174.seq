%N A109174 Number of steps to reach 1 in the modified `3x+1'-type problem defined by: If a_n is even then a_(n+1) = a_n/2. If a_n is = 1 (mod 4) then a_(n+1) = 3a_n+1. If a_n is = 3 (mod 4) then a_(n+1) = 3a_n-1.
%C A109174 The sequence will reach 1 regardless of which natural number is chosen as a_0.
%e A109174 If a_0 = 3 then a_1 = 3*a_0-1 = 8, a_2 = a_1/2 = 4, a_3 = a_2/2 = 2, a_4 = a_3/2 = 1. And so the third term in the sequence is 4.
