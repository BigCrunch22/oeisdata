%N A109440 Even numbers k such that exactly half of the primes p with p <= k/2 give k-p also a prime.
%C A109440 Let k be an even integer. Let PrimeP be the set of prime partition points {p,q} such that p + q = k, p and q are prime and p <= q. Let CompP be the set of composite partition points {p,q} such that p + q = k, p is prime, q is composite and p <= q. Sequence gives value of k such that the size of the two sets PrimeP and CompP are equal.
%C A109440 Even numbers k such that 2*A045917(k/2) = A000720(k/2). - _Andrew Howroyd_, Jan 02 2020
%e A109440 The number k = 30 is included because the two sets PrimeP={{7,23},{11,19},{13,17}} and CompP={{2,28},{3,27},{5,25}} have the same number of elements.
