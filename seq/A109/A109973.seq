%N A109973 First repeating NA iterates. The NA (Noun-Adjective) function of a finite sequence s of nonnegative integers is the finite sequence 0a1b2c...mz, where a = #0's in s, b = #1's in s, ..., z = #m's in s, m = greatest term in s.
%C A109973 This is a concatenation of finite segments.  The first segment is 01122332, obtained by writing the NA iterates of 0 until repetition occurs: 0, 01, 0111, 0113, 01122031, 02132231, 01122332, after which 01122332 repeats.  It helps to speak your way through: write 0 and say 0 one time - that's 01; then say 0 one time and 1 one time - that's 0111; then say 0 one time and 1 3 times, and so on, until reaching the repeating segment 01122332.  This segment is a fixed point of the NA function.
%C A109973 The second segment is obtained by writing the NA iterates of 1 until repetition occurs: 1, 0011, 0212, 011122, 011322, 01122231, 01132331, 01132133, after which 01132133 repeats, so that the second segment is 01132133.
%C A109973 Third segment (from initial 2): 01132133.
%C A109973 Fourth segment (from initial 3): 0113223341.
%C A109973 Fifth segment (from initial 4): 011422324251.  Here, for the first time, the repetition does not occur immediately after the first occurrence.  Indeed, iteration never reaches a fixed point of the NA function.  Instead, the iterates oscillate between 011422324251 and 011324314251.
%C A109973 These observations prompt questions: (1) what initial segments generate fixed points?  (2) do segments eventually occur periodically, regardless of the choice of initial segment?
