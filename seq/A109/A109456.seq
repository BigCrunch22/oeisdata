%N A109456 Number of Boolean functions of n variables that are self-dual and regular.
%C A109456 Or, number of self-dual 2-monotonic Boolean functions of n or fewer variables.
%C A109456 Agrees with A001532 for n <= 8 but then diverges.
%C A109456 The value for n=10 was calculated with BDD techniques; all solutions are characterized by a binary decision diagram with 30011986 nodes.
%C A109456 The value for n=11 was calculated by Minfeng Wang in May 2012 (see [Hausmann & Rodriguez]). The news was published by J.-C. Hausmann (2015). - _Fabián Riquelme_, Mar 19 2018
%C A109456 For n from 1 to 9, a(n) agrees with the number of directed zero-sum games with n players in Table 1 of Krohn and Sudhölter. - _Peter Bala_, Dec 16 2021
