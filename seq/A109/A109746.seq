%N A109746 Number of distinct sequences of the type m^k mod n for n fixed, k>=1.
%C A109746 It appears that a(p)= p-1 (for prime p) and a(2p) = p-1 (for odd prime p), but this is only speculation. I (or someone else) need to calculate more values of a(n) to settle this conjecture.
%C A109746 From _Lars Blomberg_, Oct 27 2015: (Start)
%C A109746 It also appears that:
%C A109746 When all factors of n have multiplicity=1 then a(n)=lcm(all factors - 1).
%C A109746 When n=p^2 then a(n)=n-p+1.
%C A109746 When n=2^k, k>2 then a(n)=2^(k-2)+k-1.
%C A109746 These conjectures hold for n <= 10000. (End)

%F A109746 a(n) = A002322(n) + A051903(n) - 1 (conjectured). - _Ben Whitmore_, Jul 23 2020
%e A109746 m mod 4 = {0,1,2,3,0,1,2,3,...}; m^2 mod 4 = {0,1,0,1,...}; m^3 mod 4 = {0,1,0,3,0,1,0,3,...}; but m^4 mod 4 = {0,1,0,1} = m^2 mod 4; so for higher powers of m these sequences cycle and are not distinct, thus for mod 4 we have {0,1,2,3}, {0,1} and {0,1,0,3} as distinct, so a(4) = 3.
