%N A109135 Least number whose n-th power is exclusionary (or 0 if no such n exists). An exclusionary n-th power m^n is one made up of digits not appearing in m, which itself consists of distinct digits.
%C A109135 a(n)=0 for n=1(mod 4)=A016813.
%C A109135 a(4k+1) = 0. All other zeros are unproved and have been checked up to m = 1000. - _David Wasserman_, May 27 2008
