%N A109409 Coefficients of polynomials triangular sequence produced by removing primes from the odd numbers in A028338.
%C A109409 The row sums also appear to be new: b = Flatten[Join[{{1}}, Table[Apply[Plus, Abs[CoefficientList[Product[x + g[n], {n, 0, m}], x]]], {m, 0, 10}]]] {1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 20, 20, 20, 320, 320, 320, 7040} Since the row sum of A028338 is the double factorial A000165: this result seems to be a factorization of the double factorial numbers by relatively sparse nonprime odd numbers. It might be better to reverse the order of the coefficients to get the higher powers first.
