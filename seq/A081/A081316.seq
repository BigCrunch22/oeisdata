%N A081316 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers such that n occurs a(n)-1 times, starting at n=1.
%e A081316 a(1)=2 because a(1)=1 would create a contradiction (1 would have appeared twice in the two sequences, not once). a(1)=2 implies that 1 appears once in this sequence; the first term that can equal 1 without creating a contradiction is a(4).
%Y A081316 A081315 is the corresponding sequence for nonnegative integers, see also A001462.
