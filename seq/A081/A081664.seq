%N A081664 For the smallest q for which there exists a fraction p/q containing n in its decimal expansion, this sequence gives the smallest p.
%C A081664 Inspired by problem 14 on the 2003 American Invitational Mathematics Examination, which asked for a(251). There are some slightly different versions of this sequence. For example, you could consider 1/2 = .5 or 1/2 = .50000...; I chose the latter interpretation here.
