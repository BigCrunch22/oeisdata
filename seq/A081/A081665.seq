%N A081665 Smallest integer q for which there exists a fraction p/q containing n in its decimal expansion.
%C A081665 Inspired by problem 14 on the 2003 American Invitational Mathematics Examination, which asked for a(251). There are some slightly different versions of this sequence. For example, you could consider 1/2 = .5 or 1/2 = .50000...; I chose the latter interpretation here.
