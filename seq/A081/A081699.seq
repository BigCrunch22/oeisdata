%N A081699 k-tuple abundance record-holders.
%C A081699 A number n is k-tuply abundant if it is abundant and either k = 1 or s(n) is (k-1)-tuply abundant. Thus 24 is doubly abundant: its aliquot chain is 24->36->55->17->1. a(n+1) is defined as the smallest number that is more k-tuply abundant than a(n). 966 is 179-tuply abundant.
%C A081699 Lenstra shows that for any k, there is a k-tuply abundant number. Hence the sequence is infinite if and only if the Catalan-Dickson conjecture holds: for all n, the aliquot sequence n, s(n), s(s(n)), ... either terminates at 0 or is periodic. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jun 28 2021

%e A081699 a(1) = 12 because 12 is the first abundant number.
%e A081699 a(3) = 30 because 30 is the first number more k-tuply abundant than a(2).
