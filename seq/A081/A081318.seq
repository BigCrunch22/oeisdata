%N A081318 Integers n such that the reciprocal of the largest prime factor of 10^n-1 is not a repeating decimal fraction with a period of n.
%C A081318 For all but three of the terms through a(41)=274, the reciprocal of the largest prime factor of 10^a(n)-1 is a decimal fraction with a period of a(n)/2. Of the three exceptions, there are two (a(32)=231 and a(38)=264) where the period is a(n)/3, and one (a(19)=132) where the period is a(n)/4. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Jun 27 2010

%F A081318 Integers n such that A061075(n) is not equal to A005422(n).
%e A081318 30 is in the sequence because the factorization of 10^30-1 is 3^3*7*11*13*31*37*41*211*241*271*2161*9091*2906161 and 2906161 occurs already in 10^15-1=3^3*31*37*41*271*2906161 producing a decimal fraction with a period of 15, (1/2906161=0.000000344096559000000344096559000000344...)
