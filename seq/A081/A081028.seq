%N A081028 Numbers n such that n-th term of A080997 is prime; a(n) is ranking of n-th prime number among the positive integers in terms of centrality (cf. A080997 for explanation of this concept).
%C A081028 Let p(n) be the n-th prime. In order for the centrality rankings of all numbers from 1 to p(n) to be known, it is necessary for the numbers that occupy all of the ranking positions from 1 to a(n) to be determined.
%F A081028 Formula for centrality of n: A018804(n)/n^2 (see also A080997).
