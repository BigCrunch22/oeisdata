%N A081514 Triangle read by rows: row n = lexicographically earliest choice for n distinct divisors of A081512(n) = m whose sum is m.
%C A081514 A081512(n) = smallest number m which can be expressed as the sum of n of its distinct divisors, or 0 if no such number exists. (n=2 is the only time A081512(n) = 0.)
%C A081514 Look at all sets of n distinct divisors d_1, ..., d_n of m = A081512(n) such that d_1+...+d_n = m, and choose the lexicographically earliest solution.  That is row n of the current triangle.
%C A081514 The value of d_n in the lexicographically earliest solution is given in A081513.
