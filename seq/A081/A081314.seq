%N A081314 Order of symmetry groups of n points on 3-dimensional sphere with the volume enclosed by their convex hull maximized.
%C A081314 If more than one configuration with maximal volume exists for a given n, the one with the largest symmetry group is chosen. Berman and Hanes give optimality proofs for n<=8. Higher terms are only conjectures. An independent verification of the results by Hardin, Sloane and Smith has been performed by Pfoertner in 1992 for n<28. An archive of the results with improvements for n=23,24 added in 2003 is available at link. A conjectured continuation of the sequence starting with n=28 is: 12,6,2,6,120,2,4,4,2,20,4,12,24,12,20,4,8,2,2,2,4,1,24

%e A081314 a(12)=120 because the order of the point group of the icosahedron, which is also the best known arrangement for the maximal volume problem is 120. a(7)=20 because the double 7-pyramid proved optimal by Berman and Hanes has dihedral symmetry order 20.
%Y A081314 Number of distinct edges in convex hull: A081366. Symmetry groups for Tammes problem: A080865.
