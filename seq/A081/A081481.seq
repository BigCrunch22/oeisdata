%N A081481 Consider the mapping f(a/b) = (a^3 +b^3)/(a^2+b^2). Taking a =1, b = 2 to start with and carrying out this mapping repeatedly on each new (reduced) rational number gives the following sequence 1/2,9/5,427/53,39001680/92569,... Sequence contains the numerator.
%C A081481 The mapping f(a/b) = (a + b)/(a - b). Taking a = 2 b = 1 to start with and carrying out this mapping repeatedly on each new (reduced)rational number gives the periodic sequence 2/1,3/1,2/1,3/1,...
