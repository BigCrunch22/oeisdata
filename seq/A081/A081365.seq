%N A081365 Numbers whose name in American English is a word-palindrome, reading the same forward and backward.
%C A081365 The sequence considers hyphenated names (for non-multiples of 10 between 21 and 99) and treats those as single words, hence, "twenty-one thousand twenty-one" is a term. Indeed, all numbers of the form k*10^(3*i) + k for 1 <= k <= 99 and i > 0 are terms. - _Michael S. Branicky_, Jun 19 2024
