%N A081315 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers such that n occurs a(n)-1 times, starting at n=0.
%e A081315 a(2)=3 because 2 appears a total of 3 times in the two sequences: once in A001477, once as a(1) in this sequence and once as a(3). The number 2 cannot be chosen as a(2) because that would mark the third appearance of 2, creating a contradiction; neither a(2)=3 nor the subsequent a(3)=2 creates any contradiction, however.
%Y A081315 Sequence for positive integers is A081316, see also A001462.
