%N A081536 Let f(n) be smallest number k which is a sum of n distinct numbers whose LCM is a multiple of k. Sequence gives triangle read by rows in which n-th row consists of those n numbers (row 2 is 0, 0 by convention).
%C A081536 Row 2k+1 consists of the first 2k+1 numbers, and row 2k consists of the first 2k numbers iff 2k+1 is not a power of a prime. - _Charlie Neder_, Feb 03 2019
%F A081536 The first n-2 members of row n > 2 are {1, 2, ..., n-2}. If the maximal prime powers dividing A081535(n) are all less than n, the ending terms are {n-1, A081535(n)-n*(n-1)/2}. Otherwise, they are {a, b} where either a or b is the largest prime power dividing A081535(n) and a + b = A081535(n) - (n-1)*(n-2)/2. - _Charlie Neder_, Feb 03 2019
