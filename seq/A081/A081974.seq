%N A081974 a(1) = 1 and smallest number not occurring earlier such that the product of two neighboring terms is a distinct triangular number, where "distinct" means that a(n)*a(n+1) may not equal the product of any two previous consecutive terms.
%C A081974 Perhaps another re-arrangement of natural numbers.
%e A081974 5 and 4 are the neighbors of 9 giving the triangular numbers 45 and 36 respectively.
