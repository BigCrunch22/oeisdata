%N A081512 a(n) = smallest number which can be expressed as the sum of n of its distinct divisors, or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A081512 In other words, a(n) is the smallest number m such that m has n distinct divisors d_1, ..., d_n such that d_1+...+d_n = m. (The d_i do not need to be ALL the divisors of m.) For example, a(6) = m = 24, since the divisors of 24 are 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24, and 1+2+3+4+6+8=24.
%C A081512 a(2) = 0. All other entries are nonzero.
%C A081512 In the following triangle the n-th row gives examples of the n divisors a(1), ..., a(7); a(n) = sum of the n-th row:
%C A081512 1
%C A081512 - -
%C A081512 1 2 3
%C A081512 1 2 3 6
%C A081512 1 2 3 6 12
%C A081512 1 2 3 4 6 8
%C A081512 1 2 3 6 8 12 16
%C A081512 For a given values of a(n) = m, however, there may be more than one way to choose d_1, ..., d_n so that d_1+...+d_n = m.
%C A081512 For n=10, a(10)=120, for example, there are the following equally valid solutions:

%e A081512 24 is a sum of 6 of its divisors. Namely, 1+2+3+4+6+8=24. Furthermore, 24 is the smallest natural number with at least 6 divisors (not including itself), so it must be the smallest natural number that is a sum of 6 of its divisors.
