%N A367741 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive numbers such that, for n>3, a(n) has a common factor with a(n-2) but not with a(n-1) or n.
%C A367741 This is a variation of the Yellowstone permutation A098550 with an additional restriction that no term a(n) can have a common factor with n. For the sequence to be infinite a(n) must always have a prime factor that is not a factor of n+2. See the examples below.
%C A367741 As no term a(3*k), k>=1, can contain 3 as a factor, no term a(3*k+2) can be a power of 3 as it must share a factor with with a(3*k). Likewise as a(3*(k+1)) must share a factor with a(3*k+1), the later cannot be a power of 3. Therefore no term, other than a(1), can be a power of 3, although it is likely all other positive numbers appear in the sequence.
%C A367741 For the terms studied, other than the first three terms and a(40) = 23 and a(45) = 19, the primes appear in their natural order.

%e A367741 a(4) = 15 as a(2) = 3 which 15 shares a factor with, a(3) = 2 which 15 does not share a factor with, and 15 does not share a factor with n = 4. Also 15 has a prime factor (5) which is not a factor of 4+2 = 6. The later restriction eliminates 9 as a candidate for a(4).
