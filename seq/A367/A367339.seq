%N A367339 a(n) = A367338(n) - n, or -1 if A367338(n) = -1.
%C A367339 Construct the commas sequence as in A121805, but take first term to be n. Then a(n) is the two digit number surrounding the first comma, or -1 if there is no second term (and hence no comma).
%C A367339 a(n) (unless it -1) is called the comma-number of n.
%C A367339 As in A121805, if the term before the comma ends in 0, that 0 is ignored and the comma number is a single-digit number.

%e A367339 For n = 1, A121805 begins 1, 12, 35, 94, ..., and the first comma appears as 1,1, so a(1) = 11.
%e A367339 For n = 2, A139284 begins 2, 24, 71, 89, ... and the first comma appears as 2,2, so a(2) = 22.
%e A367339 For n = 36, the commas sequence starting at 36 is simply the one-term sequence [36], no second term exists, there is no comma, and so a(36) = -1.
%Y A367339 Cf. A121805, A367338, A367340, A367341.
