%N A367491 Lexicographically least increasing sequence, starting with 2, such that no two terms (possibly identical) sum to a Fibonacci number.
%C A367491 There is an 8-state Fibonacci automaton that accepts the Zeckendorf representation of n if and only if n belongs to the sequence.
%e A367491 6 is not in the sequence, since if it were, 6+2 = 8, a Fibonacci number.
%Y A367491 Cf. A005652, A005653. This sequence allows the same term to be used twice in the sum, whereas in the other two sequences, the terms must be distinct.
