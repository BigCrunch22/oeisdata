%N A367648 Primes p such that the multiplicative order of 3 modulo p is a power of 3.
%C A367648 Prime factors of numbers of the form 3^3^i - 1: p divides 3^3^i - 1 if and only if the multiplicative order of 3 modulo p is a power of 3 not exceeding 3^i.
%e A367648 13 is a term since the multiplicative order of 3 modulo 13 is 3 = 3^1, which means that 13 is a factor of 3^3^1 - 1.
%e A367648 109 is a term since the multiplicative order of 3 modulo 109 is 27 = 3^3, which means that 109 is a factor of 3^3^3 - 1.
