%N A367540 Number of discrete implications I : L_n^2 -> L_n defined on the finite chain L_n = {0,1,...n} which satisfy the consequent boundary, i.e., I(x,y) >= y for all x,y in L_n.
%C A367540 Number of discrete implications I : L_n^2 -> L_n defined on the finite chain L_n={0,1,...n} satisfying the consequent boundary, i.e., the number of binary functions I : L_n^2 -> L_n such that I is decreasing in the first argument, increasing in the second argument, I(0,0) = I(n,n) = n and I(n,0) = 0 (discrete implication), and I(x,y) >= y for all x,y in L_n (consequent boundary).
%C A367540 The proposed formula is recursive and implemented using dynamic programming using Python. Only the first 9 terms could be obtained. See GitHub link.
