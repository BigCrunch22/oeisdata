%N A367328 The x-coordinate of the point where x + y = n, x and y are integers and x/y is as close as possible to e.
%C A367328 a(n) is nondecreasing; lim_{n->oo} a(n) = oo.
%C A367328 Swapping the x and y coordinate of the sequence does not yield the sequence defined as the point where x + y = n, x and y are integers and x/y is as close as possible to 1/e even when excluding terms that would lead to a division by 0.
%F A367328 a(n) is always either ceiling(n*e/(1 + e)) or floor(n*e/(1 + e)) = A076538(n).
%e A367328 For n = 3, the possible points are (0,3), (1,2), (2,1) as any negative value would would be further from e than 0/3. The closest value to e out of these is 2/1 so a(3) = 2.
%Y A367328 Cf. A001113 (e), A367329 (y-coordinate), A007676.
