%N A367974 Numbers which contain the "Look and Say" description (cf. A045918) of all their prime factors, counted with multiplicity.
%C A367974 Overlapping of the "Look and Say" prime factor description strings is allowed. It is likely, although unproven, that 25 = 5*5 = "two 5's" = "25" is the only number that "perfectly" describes its own "Look and Say" factorization, i.e., there are no overlapping factor description strings, and all digits of the number are used in the factor description strings. It is unknown if the sequence is infinite.
%C A367974 There are many terms of the form 5^k, where k is 2, 9, 55, 62, 71, 82, 84, 86, 125, etc. - _Ivan N. Ianakiev_, Dec 07 2023

%e A367974 1 is a term since it has no prime factors.
%e A367974 25 is a term as 25 = 5*5, i.e., two 5's being "25", which appears in 25.
%e A367974 1024 is a term as 1024 = 2^10, i.e., ten 2's being "102", which appears in 1024.
%e A367974 346146025 is a term as 346146025 = 5^2 * 61^4, i.e., two 5's and four 61's being "25" and "461", respectively, both of which appear in 346146025.
%e A367974 1719341824 is a term as 1719341824 = 2^8 * 719 * 9341, i.e., eight 2's and one 719 and one 9341 being "82", "1719" and "19341" respectively, all of which appear in 1719341824. Note that only the final digit 4 is not used in the string descriptions.
