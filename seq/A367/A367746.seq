%N A367746 a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1. For n > 2, if a(n-1) is a novel term, a(n) = |a(n-1) - a(n-2) + 1|, else if a(n-1) is a repeat term, last seen at a(m), a(n) = n-m-1.
%C A367746 The definition is similar to those of A181391 and A341094.
%C A367746 a(n) < n for all n follows from the definition.
%C A367746 2 seems to be the most frequently occurring term (51470 times in the first 16*10^6 terms).
%C A367746 In general a zero term occurs in two distinct ways: (i). Subsequent to 1,k where 1 is a repeat term and k is novel, which leads to 1,k,k then 0; (ii). k, k-1 where k-1 is novel. The former seems to happen much more frequently than the latter.
%C A367746 Conjecture: all numbers eventually appear.
%C A367746 Open questions: Does every number which occurs, occur again? Why is 2 the most frequently occurring term?  Does 0 occur infinitely many times?

%e A367746 a(1,2) = 0,1 and since 1 is novel a(3) = |1-0+1| = 2.
%e A367746 Since a(3) = 2 is a novel term,  a(4) = |2-1+1| = 2.
%e A367746 a(3,4) = 2,2 implies a(5) = 0.
%e A367746 a(36,37) = 12,11 and since 11 is novel, a(38) = |11-12+1| =  0.
%e A367746 a(23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32) = 1,6,4,7,4,1,4,1,1,0 (1,4 are repeat terms, 7 is novel). This is an exceptional occurrence of 0 outside the two categories mentioned in Comments. It is not known if there are other exceptions.
