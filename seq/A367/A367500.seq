%N A367500 The number of digraphs on n unlabeled nodes with each indegree >=1 and each outdegree >=1.
%C A367500 Digraphs counted here must be loopless, but not necessarily connected.
%C A367500 The definition is not strictly saying that there is no (global) source or sink, because the graphs are counted without considering (strong or weak) connectivity.
%C A367500 (The weakly connected digraphs of this type start 1,0,1,5,89,5327,...)
