%N A367638 Sequence S of positive integers such that the successive digits d of S are the successive Levenshtein distances between two adjacent terms of S. When possible, S is always extended with the smallest positive integer not yet present.
%H A367638 Ã‰ric Angelini, <a href="https://cinquantesignes.blogspot.com/2023/11/a-sequence-with-vladimir-iosifovich-and.html">A sequence with Vladimir Iosifovich (and his wife)</a>, Personal blog, Nov 2023.
%e A367638 The sequence starts with 1, 2, 10, 11, 11, 12, 13, 3.
%e A367638 a(1) = 1 is indeed the Ld (Levenshtein distance) between a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 2;
%e A367638 a(2) = 2 is the Ld between a(2) = 2 and a(3) = 10;
%e A367638 a(3) = 10 whose first digit 1 is the Ld between a(3) = 10 and a(4) = 11;
%e A367638 a(3) = 10 whose second digit 0 is the Ld between a(4) = 11 and a(5) = 11;
%e A367638 a(4) = 11 whose first digit 1 is the Ld between a(5) = 11 and a(6) = 12;
%e A367638 a(4) = 11 whose second digit 1 is the Ld between a(6) = 12 and a(7) = 13;
%e A367638 a(5) = 11 whose first digit 1 is the Ld between a(7) = 13 and a(8) = 3; etc.
