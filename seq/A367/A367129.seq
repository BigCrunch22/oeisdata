%N A367129 a(1)=a(2)=1; thereafter a(n) is the diameter of the sequence's digraph, where jumps from location i to i+-a(i) are permitted (within 1..n-1).
%C A367129 The diameter of the sequence's digraph is the largest eccentricity of any vertex (location) in the graph. The eccentricity of a location i means the largest number of jumps in the shortest path from location i to any other location.

%e A367129 a(5)=3 because i=1 has the largest eccentricity of any location. i=1 takes 3 jumps to reach i=4 in the shortest path:
%e A367129   i    = 1  2  3  4
%e A367129   a(i) = 1, 1, 1, 2
%e A367129          1->1->1->2
%e A367129 Every other location has eccentricity 2, which makes 3 the largest eccentricity and thus the diameter of the sequence's digraph, so a(5)=3.
