%N A367711 a(1) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not yet appeared that has a common factor with A001414(a(n-1)), the sum of the primes dividing a(n-1), with repetition.
%C A367711 In the first 100000 terms the only fixed point is 9, and it is likely no more exist. In the same range the smallest missing numbers are 4073, 5039, 5261. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the integers >= 2.

%e A367711 a(10) = 8 as a(9) = 9 and A001414(9) = 6, and 8 is the smallest unused number that shares a factor with 6. This is the first term to differ from A365060.
