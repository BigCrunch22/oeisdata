%N A367711 a(1) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not yet appeared that has a common factor k > 1 with A001414(a(n-1)), the sum of the primes dividing a(n-1), with repetition.
%C A367711 In the first 100000 terms the only fixed point is 9, and it is likely no more exist. In the same range the smallest missing numbers are 4073, 5039, 5261. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the integers >= 2.
%C A367711 From _Michael De Vlieger_, Nov 28 2023: (Start)
%C A367711 In scatterplot, composites fall in a cototient trajectory just above the line a(n)/n, while primes fall into several trajectories well below the line a(n)/n. This is an effect of finding the next term a(n) such that gcd(a(n), a(n-1)) = 1.
%C A367711 The trajectories T of primes a(n) arrange according to a(n+1)/a(n) = m. Hence, for example, T(m), m = 2 includes {2, 5, 7, 13, 19, 31, 43, ...}, T(3) includes {3, 11, 17} and may be finite, T(4) includes {23, 41, 47, 71, 83, 101, ...}, but T(m) for m in {5, 16, 17, ...} does not appear in the first 2^20 terms. It is evident that the trajectories T(m) are nonlinear.
%C A367711 The smallest missing number in a(1..1048576) is prime(3912) = 36899, followed by primes with indices 3995, 4151, 4179, etc. The smallest missing composite is 1116967. (End)
