%N A367329 The y-coordinate of the point where x + y = n, x & y are integers and x/y is as close as possible to e.
%C A367329 a(n) is nondecreasing; lim_{n->oo} a(n) = oo.
%C A367329 Swapping the x and y coordinate of the sequence does not yield the sequence defined as the point where x + y = n, x and y are integers and x/y is as close as possible to 1/e even when excluding terms that would lead to a division by 0.
%e A367329 For n = 3, the possible points are (0,3), (1,2), (2,1), as any negative fraction would would be further from e than 0/3. The closest fraction to e out of these is 2/1 so a(3) = 1.
