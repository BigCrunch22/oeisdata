%N A367595 List the positive integers but erase commas between terms if the digits just before and just after the comma have opposite parity.
%C A367595 Erase a comma if the last digit of previous term and first digit of the following term have opposite parity.

%e A367595 1213 is in the sequence. We can check by looking at where 12 and 13 appear in the list of natural numbers {..., 11, 12, 13, 14, ...}. The digits that flank the comma in the pair (11,12) are {1,1}, which have the same parity, so we keep the comma between 11 and 12. This gives {..., <--11, 12-->, ...} [the <-- --> arrows indicate the possibility of more digits to the left and right. Note that 1011 is also a member.]. Checking the flanking digits in the pair (12,13), we see that {2,1} have opposite parity, so the comma is deleted there to give {..., <--11, 1213-->, ...}. We must keep checking additional pairs to the right until we find a comma. (13,14) has flanking digits {3,1} with the same parity, so no comma is deleted. Now we see that 1213 is a member, since {..., <--11, 1213, 14-->, ...}.
