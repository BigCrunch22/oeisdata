%N A367739 Table read by ascending antidiagonals: T(n,k) is the number of k-bit numbers m such that m*prime(n)# is the average of a twin prime pair, where prime(n)# is the n-th primorial A002110(n).
%C A367739 For each k except for k=2 (whose value in row 1 is already at the maximum possible for that column), the values in the column, as n increases, increase to a maximum before beginning to descend toward zero. This behavior of the numbers in a given column can be viewed as the net result of two competing effects as n increases.
%C A367739 First, each time n is incremented, the smallest prime that can be a proper divisor of one of the two nearest neighbors of a number m*prime(n)# (thus preventing one of those two nearest neighbors from being a prime) loses its ability to divide either of those neighbors. E.g., at n=1, the candidate numbers to be tested to determine whether they are the average of a twin prime pair are numbers of the form m*prime(1)# = m*2# = m*2, i.e., even numbers, and two out of every three consecutive even numbers are prevented from being the average of a twin prime pair because one of the even number's two neighbors (m*2 -+ 1) is a proper multiple of 3. E.g., at k=4, the 4-bit numbers m are 8 through 15, but of those, m = 8, 10, 11, 13, and 14 cannot yield m*2 as the average of a twin prime pair because m*2 - 1 or m*2 + 1 is a proper multiple of 3, hence not a prime. But when we move to n=2, the candidates to be tested to determine whether they are the average of a twin prime pair are now numbers of the form m*prime(2)# = m*3# = m*2*3 = m*6, and no number of the form m*6 that fails to be the average of a twin prime pair does so because it has a neighbor that is divisible by 3.
%C A367739 Second, each time n is incremented, the numbers to be tested to determine whether they are the average of a twin prime pair get larger by a factor of prime(n). E.g., at n=4, the candidates are numbers of the form m*prime(4)# = m*7# = m*2*3*5*7 = m*210, but at n=5, the candidates are numbers of the form m*prime(5)# = m*11# = m*2*3*5*7*11 = m*2310. For a given set of numbers m (e.g., for k=10, the numbers m=512..1023), the products m*2310 may be less likely to be the average of twin primes than the smaller products m*210 because the density of primes in the vicinity of a number x decreases as x increases.
%e A367739 T(5,4) = 2 because there are 2 4-bit numbers m such that m*2*3*5*7*11 = m*2310 is the average of a twin prime pair:
%e A367739   1011_2 * 2*3*5*7*11 = 11*2310 = 25410 (the average of (25409, 25411)) and
%e A367739   1111_2 * 2*3*5*7*11 = 15*2310 = 34650 (the average of (34649, 34651)).
