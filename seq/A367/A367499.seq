%N A367499 Lexicographically least increasing sequence of positive integers, beginning with 3, with the property that no sum of two distinct terms is a Tribonacci number.
%C A367499 This sequence is the complement of A367498.  In fact, this and A367498 together form the unique partition of the positive integers into two disjoint sets, each having the property that the sum of two distinct elements is never a Tribonacci number.
