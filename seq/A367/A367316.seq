%N A367316 Number of interval-closed sets in the root poset of type A(n).
%C A367316 An interval-closed set of a poset is a subset I such that if x and y are in I with x <= z <= y, then z is in I.
%C A367316 Interval-closed sets are also called convex subsets of a poset.
%C A367316 The root poset of a root system is the partial order on positive roots where a <= b if b-a is a nonnegative sum of simple roots.

%e A367316 For n = 0, the poset is empty, so there is only one subset.For n = 1, the poset has only one element, and both subsets are interval-closed.For n = 2, the poset has three elements, and rank 1. Every subset of a poset of rank at most 1 is interval-closed, and therefore there are a(2) = 8 interval-closed sets.For n = 3, the poset has six elements, and only 45 of the 64 subsets are interval-closed.
