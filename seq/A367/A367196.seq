%N A367196 Lexicographically earliest sequence such that for any distinct j, k, m that are the side lengths of a triangle, a(j), a(k), and a(m) are not the side lengths of a triangle.
%C A367196 In a triangle, the sum of any two side lengths is greater than that of the third, so that x + y > z. The empty triangle (or line) is not counted, which means that x + y cannot be equal to z. In practice, if we have two side lengths x and y, we can find their sum s and their difference d, which tells us that side z must fall in the range d < z < s to form a triangle.
%C A367196 For n>0, A002620(n+1) gives the number of combinations of three indices whose corresponding terms cannot be the side lengths of a triangle in this sequence.
%C A367196 It appears that the local maxima are the Fibonacci numbers A000045 (except for 1s).
%C A367196 The second-largest values in the log graph, falling roughly on a line, appear to be A001076 (half of the even Fibonacci numbers).
%C A367196 Generalizing the sequence to prohibit the side lengths of any n-gon at distinct n-gonal indices gives A011782.

%e A367196 a(3)=1 because the indices 1,2,3 could not be the side lengths of a triangle, so there is no restriction and the smallest number is chosen.
%e A367196 a(7) cannot be 1 because a(3)=1, a(5)=1, and a(7)=1 could be the side lengths of a triangle at indices which are also side lengths of a triangle.
%e A367196 a(7) cannot be 2 because a(4)=2, a(6)=3, and a(7)=2 are side lengths of a triangle at indices that forbid it.
%e A367196 a(7) cannot be 3 because a(5)=1, a(6)=3, and a(7)=3 also make a triangle at indices that forbid it.
%e A367196 a(7) cannot be 4 because a(4)=2, a(6)=3 and a(7)=4 form a triangle at unsuitable indices.
%e A367196 a(7) can be 5 without contradiction, so a(7)=5.
