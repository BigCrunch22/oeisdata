%N A367620 The lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of positive numbers in which each term is a comma-child of the previous term.
%C A367620 Discovered by _David W. Wilson_ in 2007 (see 2016 Angelini link).
%C A367620 The first choice point occurs for the term after a(412987860) = 19999999918, which has two comma-children.
%C A367620 We do not know which choice to take at that point. We do know by KÃ¶nig's Infinity Lemma that one or both forks will extend to infinity. The definition of this sequence requires that we choose the smallest fork that has an infinite continuation.
%C A367620 Update, Dec 22 2023: We now know that the start of this sequence is one of four candidates (all other possible starts having terminated). The shortest of the four possible starts has length
%C A367620    8278670191169895553395510925614764265575448369172463113087634743486440833078554
%C A367620 In other words, we know that there are only four possibilities for the initial prefix of that length.
