%N A367539 Sequence of magic constants related to distance magic graphs.
%C A367539 A positive integer k is called a magic constant if there is a simple graph G whose vertices are labeled using the numbers 1, 2, ..., |V(G)| in bijective fashion such that for each vertex v, Sum_{u in N(v)} f(u) is constant. For the first term of this sequence we use the graph P_3, a path on three vertices. Label the middle vertex 3 and other two vertices as 1 and 2 in any manner. In this setup the sums defined earlier are 3 for each vertex.
%C A367539 All positive integers except 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 16 are magic constants.
