%N A367848 Lengths >= 2 of symmetrical subsequences within the prime gaps sequence.
%C A367848 Points in the primes gap sequence (A001223) are taken successively at a term and halfway between terms.
%C A367848 The lengths here are of subsequences made of 2 or more symmetrically placed, consecutive prime gaps around such a point.
%C A367848 Some points only have a subsequence of length 0 or 1 around them and they are ignored.
%C A367848 Will all odd numbers appear in this sequence?
%C A367848 Do the terms have a long-term average?
%e A367848 The first lengths are as follows, around midpoints marked with ".",
