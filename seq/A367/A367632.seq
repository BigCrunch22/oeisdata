%N A367632 Numbers k with at least one pair of adjacent divisors i,j of k with i < j such that i' > j'. Here, n' denotes the arithmetic derivative of n.
%C A367632 Numbers whose list of arithmetic derivatives of its divisors has at least one descent (in terms of its increasing list of divisors).
%C A367632 First departs from A137428 at a(11) = 72.
%e A367632 72 is in the sequence. The divisors of 72 are {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72} and their corresponding derivatives are {0, 1, 1, 4, 5, 12, 6, 16, 21, 44, 60, 156}. Since 8 < 9, and 8' = 12 > 6 = 9', 72 is a member.
