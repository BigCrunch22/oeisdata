%N A367467 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of positive integers such that a(n + a(n)) is distinct for all n.
%C A367467 Consider each index i as a location from which one can jump a(i) terms forward. To find a(n) we have to check 2 conditions:
%C A367467 1. The value a(n) can be reached in one jump by at most one previous location.
%C A367467 2. Location n reaches a location in one jump that is not reached in one jump from a location before n.
%C A367467 Described in the above way, the sequence seems to be structured as follows:
%C A367467 A083051 appears to give the indices which cannot be reached from any earlier term; the terms at these indices are 1s and 2s.
%C A367467 A087057 appears to give the indices which can be reached from an earlier term; except for a(2), these terms are first occurrences.

%C A367467 Empirical observations:
%C A367467 It appears that this sequence consists of the natural numbers in ascending order interspersed by 1 and 2.
%C A367467 If we consider the distance between successive ones, we will observe a nonperiodic pattern: 9,7,17,17,7,10,7,17,7,10,... . It appears that there are only 7, 10 and 17 with the exception of 9 once.
%C A367467 If we consider the distance between successive twos, we will also observe an interesting nonperiodic pattern: 3,7,7,3,4,3,7,3,4,3,7,7,3,... . It appears that this pattern consists only of 3, 4 and 7. (End)

%F A367467 a(n) = A049472(n) = floor(n*(1 + 1/sqrt(2))) - n, if n is not in A083051.
%F A367467 a(A083051(n)) = A184119(n+1) - A083051(n).
%F A367467 a(a(A083051(n)) + A083051(n)) + a(A083051(n)) + A083051(n) = A328987(n) = floor((a(A083051(n)) + A083051(n))*(1 + 1/sqrt(2))) = floor(A184119(n+1)*(1 + 1/sqrt(2))). (End)

%e A367467 When we evaluate a(i+a(i)) with each index i, we get a distinct value. When i=1, for example, a(1+a(1))=a(1+1)=a(2)=1;  no other i gives 1 as the solution to a(i+a(i)). When i=4, a(4+a(4))=a(4+2)=a(6)=4, and 4 is likewise a solution unique to i=4.
