%N A367091 Length of runs of consecutive numbers in A367090, i.e., size of gaps in the set of sums of distinct powers of 3 and distinct powers of 4.
%C A367091 The numbers that occur in this sequence are, in order of first appearance: 2, 36, 23, 14, 1081, 20, ... It is not known which numbers will eventually appear and which numbers will never occur in this sequence.
%C A367091 The first 1's (which correspond to isolated numbers in A367090, or gaps that are a singleton) appear as a(131) = a(132) = 1.
%C A367091 This set exhibits an interesting self-similar, pseudo-symmetric structure. This is due to the Proposition given in A367090.

%e A367091 Sequence A367090 (= numbers that are not the sum of distinct powers of 3 or 4) starts (62, 63, 143, 144, 207, 208, 209, 210, ...), so the first two runs of consecutive terms are 2 = #{62, 63} and 2 = #{143, 144}, the next run is of length 36.
