%N A367128 a(1)=a(2)=1; thereafter a(n) is the radius of the sequence's digraph, where jumps from location i to i+-a(i) are permitted (within 1..n-1).
%C A367128 The radius of the sequence's digraph is the smallest eccentricity of any vertex (location) in the graph. The eccentricity of a location i means the largest number of jumps in the shortest path from location i to any other location.

%e A367128 To find a(5), we can look at the eccentricity of each location:
%e A367128   i            = 1     2     3     4
%e A367128   a(i)         = 1,    1,    1,    1
%e A367128                  1 <-> 1 <-> 1 <-> 1
%e A367128   eccentricity = 3     2     2     3
%e A367128 i=1 has eccentricity 3 because it requires up to 3 jumps to reach any other location (3 to i=4), and similarly i=4 has eccentricity 3 too.
%e A367128 i=2 and i=3 have eccentricity 2 as they require at most 2 jumps to reach anywhere.
%e A367128 The smallest eccentricity of any location is 2, which makes 2 the radius of the sequence's digraph, so a(5)=2.
