%N A367021 Numbers that can be written as both the sum of two or more consecutive nonprimes and the sum of two or more consecutive primes.
%C A367021 It seems that more than one consecutive number set from one kind or the other may exist for a term. Also, for some terms, an equal number of addends from each kind may correspond.
%e A367021 5 is a term because 5 = 1 + 4 = 2 + 3, which is the sum of two consecutive nonprimes and also the sum of two consecutive primes.
%e A367021 17 is a term because 17 = 8 + 9 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7, the sum of two consecutive nonprimes and also the sum of four consecutive primes.
