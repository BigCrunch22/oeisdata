%N A367174 a(n) = the maximum number of distinct tilings of a polyhex of size n using any combination of polyhex tiles of sizes 1 through n.
%C A367174 The sequence considers reflections and rotations as distinct tilings. The polyhexes being tiled and the tiles themselves may be with or without holes.
%e A367174 a(3) = 5 because the polyhex of size 3 that has each cell touching both the other cells can be tiled by (1) a polyhex of size 3, (2) 3 polyhexes of size 1, and (3) a polyhex of size 1 and a polyhex of size 2 in three distinct ways.
