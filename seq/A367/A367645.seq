%N A367645 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive numbers with the property that the sequence formed by the pairs of digits adjacent to the commas between the terms equals the magnitude of the successive differences between the terms.
%C A367645 The sequence is finite; after twelve terms 18 is reached which has no following term - see A367341.
%e A367645 a(6) = 78 as a(5) = 135, and |78 - 135| = 57 which can be formed from the last digit of 135 and the first digit of 78.
%e A367645 a(12) = 18 as a(11) = 109, and |18 - 109| = 91 which can be formed from the last digit of 109 and the first digit of 18. See A367341 for a proof that no following term can exist.
