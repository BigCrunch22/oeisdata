%N A367147 Index of matching grid point in the bijection between two infinite triangular grids with one grid rotated by Pi/6 around the common point (0,0), using an enumeration of the grid points by A307014 and A307016.
%C A367147 The methods used to achieve a distance-limited bijection of the points of two square grids (see A307110) are applied here to triangular grids. The two grids, which are rotated by 30 degrees = Pi/6 from each other, are assigned the colors red and blue to distinguish them, which are also used in the illustrations. The blue triangular grid is turned clockwise by 15 degrees = Pi/12, all points are lined up on parallel lines with inclination Pi/12 towards the vertical axis. These are called blue lines. The vertical distance between adjacent points is cos(Pi/12). The same is done for the red grid with a CCW rotation of Pi/12. The whole plane is divided into stripes with a width of cos(Pi/12) ~= 0.9659. Every blue line and every red line contains exactly one grid point of its color in each stripe. The blue and red lines alternately intersect the horizontal centerline of a stripe. The distance between two intersections of the same color is d = sqrt(3)/(2*cos(Pi/12)). The bijection maps the section of a blue line in a stripe to the section of the unique red line, that intersects the centerline less than d/2 away. The grid points on these two line sections are the partners of the tile bijection.
%C A367147 While the method described only finds a minimum of the maximum distance of approximately 0.9659 by assigning the bijection partners using tiles, applying the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm to the bipartite graph corresponding to a sufficiently large section of the two infinite grids achieves significantly lower maximum distances. We conjecture that an upper bound for the maximum distance is sqrt(2)/2~=0.7071. See the corresponding link.
%C A367147 A method that reduces the maximal occurring bijection distance to its conjectured minimum, and only requires local rearrangements, as described for the square grids in A307731, is currently not known in the present case of the triangular grids.
