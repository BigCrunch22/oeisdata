%N A373635 Number of free n-celled polyominoes to which two inequivalent cells can be adjoined such that the two resulting free (n+1)-celled polyominoes are identical.
%C A373635 Two cells that can be adjoined to an n-celled polyomino are equivalent if there is an isomorphism between the two resulting (n+1)-celled polyominoes that maps the adjoined cell of the first to the adjoined cell of the second.

%e A373635 The smallest example is the P pentomino shown below. The two free hexominoes obtained by adjoining one of the two cells marked "*" are identical, but there is no isomorphism between them that also maps the marked cell of the first to the marked cell of the second.
