%N A373537 Decimal expansion of the Euclidean length of the shortest minimum-link polygonal chains joining all the vertices of the cube [0,1]^3.
%C A373537 It has been proved that it is not possible to join the 8 vertices of a cube with a polygonal chain that has fewer than 6 edges (see Links, Optimal cycles enclosing all the nodes of a k-dimensional hypercube, Theorem 2.2).
%C A373537 Here we consider the additional constraint of minimizing the total (Euclidean) length of the minimum-link polygonal chains (which consist of exactly 6 line segments connected at their endpoints) that join all the vertices of the cube [0,1] X [0,1] X [0,1].
%C A373537 A solution to the above-stated problem is provided by the 6-link polygonal chain (0,0,1)-(0,0,0)-(1+(x+2+sqrt(2))/(2*sqrt(2)(x+sqrt(2))),1+(x+2+sqrt(2))/(2*sqrt(2)(x+sqrt(2))),0)-(1/2,1/2,1+x/sqrt(2))-(- (x+2+sqrt(2))/(2*sqrt(2)(x+sqrt(2))),1+(x+2+sqrt(2))/(2*sqrt(2)(x+sqrt(2))),0)-(1,0,0)-(1,0,1), where x = (1/2)*sqrt((2/3)^(2/3)*((9+sqrt(177)))^(1/3) - 4*(2/(27+3*sqrt(177)))^(1/3)) + (1/2)*sqrt(4*(2/(27+3*sqrt(177)))^(1/3) - (2/3)^(2/3)*(9+sqrt(177))^(1/3) + 4*sqrt(2/((2/3)^(2/3)*(9+sqrt(177))^(1/3) - 4*(2/(27+3*sqrt(177)))^(1/3)))) = 1.597920933550032074764705350780465558827883608091828573735862154752648...
%C A373537 The total (Euclidean) length of the mentioned polygonal chain is about 11.105251123 and this value cannot be beaten by any other 6-link polygonal chain covering all the vertices belonging to the set {0,1} X {0,1} X {0,1} (a nice proof was posted on MathOverflow on June 5, 2024 by a new user, DR.LL, whose profile was subsequently deleted for unknown reasons).
