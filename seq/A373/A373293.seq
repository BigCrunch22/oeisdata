%N A373293 Number of edge covers of F_{n,3}.
%C A373293 Label vertices of F_{n,3} with v1, ..., v_n, a, b, c, with b adjacent to both a and c. An edge cover is a subset of the edges so that each vertex is the endpoint of at least one edge. Each of the n vertices has 7 ways to connect to vertices a, b, c. Once we connect all v_i's, we then have 4 options for the edges ab and bc to exist or not, giving 4*7^m options. But not all of these will be an edge cover. For example, if all v_i's connected to a and b only, we have to add edge bc in the second step. So 5*3^m are removed. But we removed 3 cases where all v_i's connected to only a, or only b, or only c too many times.
