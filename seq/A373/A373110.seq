%N A373110 Number of distinct circles that can be constructed from the 4 vertices and the equally spaced 4*n points placed on the sides of a square when every pair of the 4 + 4*n points are connected by a circle and where the points lie at the ends of the circle's diameter.
%C A373110 A circle is constructed for every pair of the 4 + 4*n points, the two points lying at the ends of a diameter of the circle.
%C A373110 See A373106 and A373107 for images of the circles.
%F A373110 Conjectured:
%F A373110 For even n, a(n) = (14*n^2 + 21*n + 10)/2.
%F A373110 For odd n, a(n) = (14*n^2 + 21*n + 9)/2.
