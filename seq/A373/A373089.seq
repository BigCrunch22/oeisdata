%N A373089 Coefficients of the power series expansion at p=1 of the time constant C(-1,p) for last passage percolation on the complete directed acyclic graph, where the edges' weights are equal to 1 or -1 with respective probabilities p and 1-p.
%C A373089 C(-1,p) is also the speed of the front for an interacting particle system with 2 bins, which corresponds to the particular case of the max-growth system where the probability distribution has two atoms 1 and -1 with respective probabilities p and 1-p.
%C A373089 The first 6 coefficients of this sequence coincide with the first 6 coefficients of A321309.
