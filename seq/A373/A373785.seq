%N A373785 Decimal expansion of the area of the Spiral of Theodorus.
%C A373785 The length of the legs of the k-th triangle of the Spiral of Theodorus are 1 and sqrt(k), while the length of the hypotenuse is sqrt(k + 1). Theodorus stopped at the 16th triangle, whose hypotenuse measures sqrt(17), because from the next triangle his spiral began to overlap (see A072895).
%C A373785 The area of the k-th triangle is (1/2) * sqrt(k), so the area A of the spiral constructed by Theodorus is A = (1/2)*Sum_{k=1..16} sqrt(k) = 22.234598300071...
%C A373785 The perimeter of the spiral of Theodorus (up to the 16th triangle) is 17 + sqrt(17).
