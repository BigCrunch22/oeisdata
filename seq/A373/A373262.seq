%N A373262 Numbers k for which A276085(k) == -1 (mod 3), where A276085 is the primorial base log-function.
%C A373262 Numbers k such that the 2-adic valuation of k minus the 3-adic valuation of k is equal to -1 modulo 3.
%C A373262 When terms are multiplied by 2, forms a subsequence of A339746 (its even terms), and when multiplied by 3, forms a subsequence of A373261 (its multiples of 3).
%C A373262 More widely stated, the sequence lists one part of a 3-part partition of the positive integers with a symmetric relationship between the parts (further explained in the 2021 comment in A339746). - _Peter Munn_, Jul 19 2024
