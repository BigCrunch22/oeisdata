%N A373615 Positive integers that cannot be written as a sum of a practical number and an 11-gonal number.
%C A373615 Somu and Tran (2024) conjectured that there are finitely many such integers. It was also conjectured that 105712 is the largest such integer. This conjecture was checked up to 10^8.
