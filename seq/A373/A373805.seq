%N A373805 If a(n-1) is not a prime, then a(n) = 2*a(n-1) + S; otherwise set S = -S and a(n) = prine(n) + S; start with a(1) = S = 1.
%C A373805 The doubling and adding-or-subtracting 1 runs alternate between Riesel type (as in A374965) and Sierpinski type (as in A373801). The interest, as in both of those sequences, is whether the sequence will hit a Riesel or Sierpinski number. If that ever happens, from that point on the sequence will double and add +-1 for ever and no more primes will appear.
%C A373805 After 4000 terms, the doubling run that began at a(2380) = 21168 is still growing. If it does terminate, at a prime with fewer than 1000 digits, the b-files of A373806 and A373807 should be updated, and if possible, extended further.  On the other hand, if this run ends with a prime of more than 1000 digits, this should be recorded as a comment in all three of A373806-A373807.

%e A373805 We start with a(1) = S = 1. Since 1 is not a prime, a(2) = 2*1 + 1 = 3.
%e A373805 3 is a prime, so now S = -1 and a(3) = prime(3) - 1 = 5-1 = 4.
%e A373805 4 is not a prime, so a(4) = 2*4 - 1 = 7.
%e A373805 And so on.
