%N A373647 Positive integers that cannot be written as a sum of a practical number and a square.
%C A373647 Somu et al. (2023) proved that there are infinitely many such integers.
%C A373647 Somu and Tran (2024) proved a more general result, which states that infinitely many positive integers cannot be written as a sum of a practical number and an s-gonal number if s is congruent to 4 modulo 12.
