%N A373138 Numbers k such that A276085(k) is a multiple of 8, where A276085 is the primorial base log-function.
%C A373138 Because A276085 is completely additive, this is a multiplicative semigroup; if m and n are in the sequence then so is m*n.
%C A373138 The terms should be the integers in a multiplicative subgroup of the positive rationals. Denoting the k-th prime by p_k, a set of generators for this subgroup might be the union of {20, 81} with an infinite set constituted as follows: if p_k == 3 (mod 4) then p_k * p_{k+1} is in the set, if p_k == 1 (mod 4) then p_k^3 * p_{k+1} is in the set. - _Peter Munn_, Jul 15 2024
