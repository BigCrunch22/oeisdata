%N A373390 a(n) = n for n <= 3; for n > 3, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number that is coprime to a(n-1) but has a common factor with at least one of a(1)...a(n-2).
%C A373390 The sequence uses a similar criteria for selecting the next term as A098550 and A247942, but here all terms prior to a(n-1) can be checked for a common factor with a(n). This leads to the terms following a similar pattern to the EKG sequence A064413, i.e., the terms are concentrated along just three lines of different gradient, and the lower line consists only of primes. Primes do appear in the upper two lines but these become scarce as n increases, especially along the middle line. See the attached image for the first 1000 terms. For the first 100000 terms the primes appear in their natural order, implying that is likely true for all n.
%C A373390 The fixed points begin 1, 2, 3, 4, 18, 20, 22, 32, 98, and it is likely no more exist. Given that A098550 and A247942 are permutations of the positive integers it is almost certainly true that this sequence is also.

%H A373390 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A373390/a373390.png">Image of the first 1000 terms</a>. The primes are shown in red while terms with two, three, or four and more distinct prime factors are show as yellow, green and violet respectively. The white line is a(n) = n.
%e A373390 a(11) = 7 as 7 is coprime to a(10) = 6 while sharing a factor with a(8) = 14. This is the first term to differ from A098550.
%e A373390 a(38) = 77 as 77 is coprime to a(37) = 30 while sharing a factor with a(30) = 28. This is the first term to differ from A247942.
