%N A373829 Number of inefficient arrangements in A373182, where inefficient means that the maximum number of persons that a seating arrangement can hold is not achieved.
%C A373829 The maximum number of persons that can be seated in the arrangements in A373182 in n seats is ceiling(n/2).
%C A373829 The seatings here are maximal in the sense that no additional person can be seated without breaking the condition in A373182, but maximum seatings are excluded.
%C A373829 The ratio a(n)/A373182(n) -> 1 as n -> infinity (at a much slower initial rate for even n).
%F A373829 a(n) = A373182(n) - (ceiling((n+1)/2))!.
%e A373829 a(5)=6 are the following seatings, where _ denotes an empty seat. Seatings of 3 people are the maximum for n=5 and those are not included.
