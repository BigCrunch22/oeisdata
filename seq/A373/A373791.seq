%N A373791 a(n) = 0 if p = prime(n) is introduced in A373390 by 2*p, or 1 if p is introduced by 3*p.
%C A373791 It is conjectured (see A373790) that every prime p in A373390 is introduced by either 2*p or 3*p, and that exactly 11 primes (listed in A372078) are introduced by 3*p. This would imply that the present sequence is 0 after the 35th term.
