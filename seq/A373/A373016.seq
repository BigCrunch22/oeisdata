%N A373016 a(n) is the least positive integer k such that 3*n^2 + 2*n + k is a square.
%C A373016 The scatterplot shows an interesting crosshatch structure where all terms are at the intersection of ascending and descending hatches.
%C A373016 Terms on each hatch are quite well fitted by a polynomial of degree 2.
%C A373016 For terms on ascending hatches, the parity of the term indices does not change on a given hatch but alternates from one hatch to the next and on the same hatch, the parity of two consecutive terms alternates.
%C A373016 For terms on descending hatches, the parity of the indices of two consecutive terms alternates on the same hatch and that of terms does not change on the same hatch but alternates from one hatch to the next.
%C A373016 All squares exclusively are in ascending order on the same ascending hatch at n = 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, ... but some squares can be also found at the intersection of other hatches.
%C A373016 The first differences of the indices of the terms located on ascending and descending hatches are respectively equal to 4 and 3. For terms that are on the ascending and descending hatches, the differences of order 2 quickly become constant and equal to 2 and 4, respectively.
%C A373016 The fixed points begin 3, 48, 675, 9408, etc. They are all divisible by 3 and their parity seems to alternate. It appears that they are the positive terms of A007654.
%F A373016 a(n) is the smallest square greater than 3*n^2 + 2*n, minus 3*n^2 + 2*n. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, May 21 2024
%F A373016 1 <= a(n) <= floor(sqrt(12)*n) + 3. I believe both bounds are tight infinitely often. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, May 21 2024
%F A373016 a(n) = A080883(A045944(n)). - _Michel Marcus_, May 22 2024
%e A373016 a(1) = 4 because 3*1^2 + 2*1 = 5 and 5 + 1, 5 + 2, 5 + 3 are not squares, but 5 + 4 is. So, 4 is a term.
%e A373016 a(2) = 9 because 3*2^2 + 2*2 = 16 and 16 + 1, 16 + 2, 16 + 3, 16 + 4, 16 + 5, 16 + 6, 16 + 7, 16 + 8 are not squares, but 16 + 9 is. So, 9 is a term.
