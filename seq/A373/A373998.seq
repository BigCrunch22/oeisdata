%N A373998 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 5; for n > 4, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number that is coprime to a(n-1) and a(n-2) but has a common factor with at least one of a(1)...a(n-3).
%C A373998 For the terms studied, and similar to A373390 and A089088, the terms are concentrated along distinct lines of different gradient, four in this sequence, and like those sequences, the lowermost line is composed only of primes.
%C A373998 Note that in A089088, A373390, and this sequence, a(n) is coprime to zero, one and two previous terms, and the corresponding sequence terms are concentrated along two, three and four lines respectively.
%C A373998 The fixed points are 1, 2, 3, 8, 45, 51, and it is likely no more exist. For the terms studied the primes appear in their natural order. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A373998 a(7) = 25 as 25 is the smallest unused number that is coprime to a(5) = 4 and a(6) = 9 while sharing a factor with a(4) = 5.
