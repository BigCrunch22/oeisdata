%N A373999 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 5, a(5) = 7; for n > 5, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number that is coprime to a(n-1), a(n-2) and a(n-3) but has a common factor with at least one of a(1)...a(n-4).
%C A373999 Initially the terms agree with the observation noted in A373998 and are concentrated predominantly along five lines of different gradient, with the primes forming the lowermost line. However this pattern is disrupted by the second lowest line showing a repetitive discontinuous jump to lower values which also interrupts the third middle line. An examination of the terms shows this is due to the appearance of three consecutive terms which are not divisible by 2 or 3. This allows subsequent terms to be a low multiple of 2 and 3, forming numbers which are less than the most recently appearing prime values. Also of note is after approximately 85000 terms the upper two lines merge; it is assumed that the remaining four lines continue in the above pattern as n grows arbitrarily large, although this is unknown.
%C A373999 Other than the first three terms the fixed points in the first 100000 terms are 35, 63, 219, 231, 1407, 2967, 3003, 6555, 14007, 14031, 32103, 77343, although it is likely more exist. For the terms studied the primes appear in their natural order. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
