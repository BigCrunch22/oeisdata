%N A373646 Positive integers that cannot be written as a sum of a practical number and an 18-gonal number.
%C A373646 Somu and Tran (2024) conjectured that there are finitely many such integers. It was also conjectured that 8541224 is the largest such integer. This conjecture was checked up to 10^8.
