%N A373026 a(n) is the least positive integer k such that 3*n^2 + 2*n - k is a square.
%C A373026 The scatterplot shows an interesting structure where terms are on descending hatches.
%C A373026 Terms on each hatch are quite well fitted by a polynomial of degree 2.
%C A373026 The parity of the term indices alternates from one hatch to the next and that of two consecutive terms alternates on the same hatch.
%C A373026 For terms on a given hatch, the differences of order 2 quickly become constant and equal to 2.
%C A373026 The fixed points begin 1, 16, 225, 3136, etc. They appear to be all squares and to come from A098301.
%e A373026 a(1) = 1 because 3*1^2 + 2*1 = 5 and 5-1 is a square. So, 1 is a term.
%e A373026 a(2) = 7 because 3*2^2 + 2*2 = 16 and 16-1, 16-2, 16-3, 16-4, 16-5, 16-6 are not squares, but 16-7 is. So, 7 is a term.
