%N A373116 Fibonacci numbers whose digits product is a positive perfect power (A001597).
%C A373116 Since the product of the digits of Fibonacci(k) is required to be positive, Fibonacci(k) does not have zero as a digit. For this reason this list is probably finite, since it is conjectured that there are only finitely many Fibonacci numbers that do not contain the digit zero (see A076564). If the conjecture is true, the largest number possessing the property would be Fibonacci(85) = 259695496911122585 whose digit product is 194400^2.
%C A373116 Unlike A373049, here the product uses all the digits of Fibonacci(k).
%e A373116 196418 is a term, because Fibonacci(27) = 196418 and the product of its digits is 1*9*6*4*1*8 = 12^3.
