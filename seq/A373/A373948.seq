%N A373948 Run-compression encoded as a transformation of compositions in standard order.
%C A373948 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%C A373948 We define the (run-) compression of a sequence to be the anti-run obtained by reducing each run of repeated parts to a single part. Alternatively, compression removes all parts equal to the part immediately to their left. For example, (1,1,2,2,1) has compression (1,2,1).
%C A373948 For the present sequence, the a(n)-th composition in standard order is obtained by compressing the n-th composition in standard order.
