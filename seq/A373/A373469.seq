%N A373469 Least odd k such that C(2k, k) == 1 (mod A007775(n)), or 0 if no such k exists.
%C A373469 A007775 lists the odd numbers not divisible by 3 or 5. It seemed that these are exactly the odd numbers not in A086748 (= odd m such that C(2k,k) == 1 (mod m) has no odd solution k), i.e., the numbers in A086748 would exactly be the odd multiples of 3 and 5, but so far there was no proof or disproof for that. The present sequence gives an explicit proof, if it exists, for each x in A007775, that x is not in A086748.
%C A373469 It is highly possible that a(n) = 0 for n with m = A007775(n) divisible by three or more distinct primes, in which case values of k such that C(2k,k) coprime to m, let alone C(2k,k) == 1 (mod m), are very sparse and possibly finite. See A030979 for a similar problem. - _Max Alekseyev_, Jul 14 2024
