%N A373956 Greatest sum of run-compression of a permutation of the prime indices of n.
%C A373956 We define the run-compression of a sequence to be the anti-run obtained by reducing each run of repeated parts to a single part. Alternatively, run-compression removes all parts equal to the part immediately to their left. For example, (1,1,2,2,1) has run-compression (1,2,1).
%C A373956 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798.
%F A373956 a(n) = A056239(n) iff n belongs to A335433 (the separable case), complement A335448.
%e A373956 The prime indices of 24 are {1,1,1,2}, with permutations such as (1,1,2,1) whose run-compression sums to 4, so a(24) = 4.
%e A373956 The prime indices of 216 are {1,1,1,2,2,2}, with permutations such as (1,2,1,2,1,2) whose run-compression sums to 9, so a(216) = 9.
