%N A373790 The term that immediately precedes prime(n) in A373390.
%C A373790 In order for A373390 to contain a prime term, say a(i) = p, then there must be at least one earlier term which is a multiple of p, say a(j) = k*p.
%C A373790 Conjectures:
%C A373790 (C1): For each prime p > 3, there is exactly one multiple of p that appears before p itself. Call this multiple k*p. Note that we know (see the Comments in A373390) that every prime appears in A373390.  We will call this multiple k*p the term that "introduces" p.
%C A373790 (C2): For every prime p > 3, the introducing term k*p is always either 2*p or 3*p, and for all except the eleven primes listed in A372078 it is 2*p.
%C A373790 (C3): For every prime p > 3, the introducing term k*p occurs exactly 2 terms before p itself, with the single exception of A373390(11) = 7 which is introduced in A373390 three terms earlier, by A373390(8) = 14.
%C A373790 (C4): The primes appear in A373390 in their natural order. [This should follow from the proof that A373390 is a permutation of the positive integers.]

%e A373790 A373390(24) = 11 = prime(5), so a(5) = A373390(23) = 39.
