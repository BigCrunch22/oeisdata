%N A373010 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers such that no three terms a(j), a(j+k), a(j+2k) (for any j and k) form a progression of the form p, p-2*q, p-q, where q >= 0.
%C A373010 This sequence avoids one of the six permutations of a set of three integers in arithmetic progression. For example, the set {1,2,3} can be ordered as tuples (1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), and (3, 2, 1). In this sequence, we avoid (3,1,2) and other progressions of the form p, p-2*q, p-q, for all q >= 0.
