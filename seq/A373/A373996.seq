%N A373996 Zeros x2 of polynomial functions f(x) = 1/k*x*(x - x1)*(x - x2), which have three integer zeros 0, x1 and x2 (with 0 < x1 < x2) as well as two extreme points and one inflection point with integer x-coordinates (sorted in ascending order, first by the sum x1 + x2 and then by x1).
%C A373996 The corresponding values x1 are in A373995. The corresponding maximum values for k, for which the y-coordinates of the extrema and the inflection are integers, are in A373997.
%C A373996 These polynomial functions can be used in math lessons when discussing curves. Zeros, extreme points and inflection points can be determined without unnecessary calculation effort with fractions and roots.
%C A373996 Of course, these functions can be stretched in the y-direction by a factor 1/k without affecting the zeros, the extreme points and the inflection point, or shifted in the x-direction, whereby the zeros, the extreme points and the inflection point are also shifted.
%F A373996 x-coordinate of the 1. extreme point: x3 = (x1 + x2 + sqrt(x1^2 + x2^2 - x1*x2))/3.
%F A373996 x-coordinate of the 2. extreme point: x4 = (x1 + x2 - sqrt(x1^2 + x2^2 - x1*x2))/3.
%F A373996 x-coordinate of the inflection point: x5 = (x1 + x2)/3 = (x3 + x4)/2.
%F A373996 k = GCD(f(x3), f(x4), f(x5)).
%e A373996 24 is twice in the sequence, since the x-cordinates of the extreme points and of the inflection point of f(x) = 1/k*x*(x - 9)*(x - 24) are 4, 18 and 11 and of f(x) = 1/k*x*(x - 15)*(x - 24) are 6, 20 and 13.
