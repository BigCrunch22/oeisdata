%N A373837 Numbers k such that bigomega(k) and A276085(k) are both multiples of 3, where bigomega (A001222) and A276085 are fully additive with a(p) = 1 and a(p) = p#/p respectively.
%C A373837 Because A145784 and A339746 are both multiplicative semigroups (as A001222 and A276085 are completely additive), this is also: if m and n are in the sequence then so is m*n.
