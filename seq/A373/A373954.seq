%N A373954 Excess run-compression of standard compositions. Sum of all parts minus sum of compressed parts of the n-th integer composition in standard order.
%C A373954 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%C A373954 We define the (run-) compression of a sequence to be the anti-run obtained by reducing each run of repeated parts to a single part. Alternatively, compression removes all parts equal to the part immediately to their left. For example, (1,1,2,2,1) has compression (1,2,1).
