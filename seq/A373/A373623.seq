%N A373623 a(n) = n for n <= 3; for n > 3, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number that shares a factor with the most recently appearing even number if a(n-1) is odd, otherwise it shares a factor with the most recently appearing odd number if a(n-1) is even.
%C A373623 The terms studied are all concentrated along lines of different gradient; the prime numbers are all distributed on the lines with gradient < 1 while all other numbers are on the lines with gradient > 1, the highest concentration of terms appearing on a line with gradient ~ 1.04. The uppermost of these lines appear to consist entirely of numbers with two or three distinct prime factors. See the attached images. It is conjectured that this behavior is true for all n.
%C A373623 The primes do not appear in their natural order, with 13 appearing before 11 being the first example. The fixes points being 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 18, 38; it is likely no more exist.
%C A373623 In the first 200000 terms the longest run of consecutive even terms is eight, beginning at a(7681) = 8078, while the longest run of consecutive odd terms is seven, beginning at a(101234) = 105471. It in unknown if these runs can be of arbitrary length. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive numbers.
