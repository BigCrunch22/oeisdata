%N A373234 Relative of Hofstadter Q-sequence: a(n) = max(0, n+196) for n <= 0;  a(n) = a(n-a(n-1)) + a(n-a(n-2)) + a(n-a(n-3)) for n > 0.
%C A373234 Sequences like this are more naturally considered with the first nonzero term in position 1. But this sequence would then match A000027 for its first 196 terms.
%C A373234 This sequence has exactly 223 terms (of positive index).  a(223) = 0, so an attempt to calculate a(224) would refer to itself.
%C A373234 Without the convention that a(n) = 0 for n <= -196, this sequence would have exactly 24 terms (of positive index), since computing a(25) refers to a(-378).
%C A373234 If 196 in this sequence's definition is replaced by any larger number congruent to 0 mod 7, the behavior is essentially the same, though the quasilinear part (see Formula section) lasts longer.

%F A373234 If the index is between 67 and 195 (inclusive), then a(7n) = 7n+2, a(7n+1) = 7n+198, a(7n+2) = 7n+200, a(7n+3) = 7, a(7n+4) = 2n+437, a(7n+5) = n+385, a(7n+6) = 194.
