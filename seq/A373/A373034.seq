%N A373034 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of edge subsets E of the n-dimensional hypercube graph such that E contains a path between two given nodes at Hamming distance k, 0 <= k <= n.
%C A373034 T(n,k)/A061301(n) is the probability that two given nodes at Hamming distance k in the n-dimensional hypercube graph are still connected after each edge has been independently deleted with probability 1/2.
%C A373034 The bunkbed conjecture (the version where all edges, including the posts, have the same probability 1/2 of being retained) holds for the n-dimensional hypercube graph if and only if the (n+1)-st row is nonincreasing.
