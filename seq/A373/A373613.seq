%N A373613 Positive integers that cannot be written as a sum of a practical number and a decagonal number.
%C A373613 Somu and Tran (2024) conjectured that there are finitely many such integers. It was also conjectured that 13613213 is the largest such integer. This conjecture was checked up to 10^8.
