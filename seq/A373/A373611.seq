%N A373611 Positive integers that cannot be written as a sum of a practical number and a nonagonal number.
%C A373611 Somu and Tran (2024) conjectured that there are finitely many such integers. It was also conjectured that 325808 is the largest such integer. This conjecture was checked up to 10^8.
