%N A373108 Number of edges among all distinct circles that can be constructed from the 4 vertices and the equally spaced 4*n points placed on the sides of a square when every pair of the 4 + 4*n points are connected by a circle and where the points lie at the ends of the circle's diameter.
%C A373108 A circle is constructed for every pair of the 4 + 4*n points, the two points lying at the ends of a diameter of the circle.
%C A373108 See A373106 and A373107 for images of the circles.
%F A373108 a(n) = A373106(n) + A373107(n) - 1 by Euler's formula.
