%N A373633 Positive integers that cannot be written as a sum of a practical number and a 15-gonal number.
%C A373633 Somu and Tran (2024) conjectured that there are finitely many such integers. It was also conjectured that 1486748 is the largest such integer. This conjecture was checked up to 10^8.
