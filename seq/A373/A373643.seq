%e A373643 Let S = A126706, the sequence of k neither squarefree nor prime powers.
%e A373643 a(1..4) = 0 since S(1) = 12.
%e A373643 a(5) = 1 since (11, 12, 13) contains S(1) = 12.
%e A373643 a(6) = 0 since (13, 14, 15, 16, 17) contains no number in S.
%e A373643 a(7) = 1 since (17, 18, 19) contains S(2) = 18.
%e A373643 a(8) = 1 since (19, 20, 21, 22, 23) contains S(3) = 20.
%e A373643 a(9) = 2 since (23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29) contains S(4) = 24 and S(5) = 28, etc.
