%N A373546 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number that shares a factor with a(n-1) if a(n-1) is even otherwise is coprime to a(n-1) if a(n-1) is odd.
%C A373546 The sequence forms a repetitive pattern of three even numbers separated by 2 followed by three odd numbers separated by 2, the first odd number being 3 less than the third even number. One third of all terms are fixed points, and the primes appear in their natural order.
%e A373546 a(9) = 10 as a(8) = 8 is an even number and 10 is the smallest unused positive number to share a factor with 8.
