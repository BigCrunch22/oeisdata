%N A373467 Palindromes with exactly 7 (distinct) prime divisors.
%F A373467 Intersection of A002113 and A176655.
%e A373467 Obviously all terms must be palindromic; let us consider the prime factorization:
%e A373467 a(1) = 20522502 = 2 * 3^2 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 67 has exactly 7 distinct prime divisors, although the factor 3 appears twice in the factorization. (Without the second factor 3 the number would not be palindromic.)
%e A373467 a(2) = 21033012 = 2^2 * 3 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 103 has exactly 7 distinct prime divisors, although the factor 2 appears twice in the factorization. (Without the second factor 2 the number would not be palindromic.)
%e A373467 a(3) = 22444422 = 2 * 3 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 37 * 101 is the product of 7 distinct primes (cf. A123321), hence the first squarefree term of this sequence.
%o A373467 (PARI) A373467_upto(N, start=vecprod(primes(7)), num_fact=7)={ my(L=List()); while(N >= start = nxt_A002113(start), omega(start)==num_fact && listput(L, start)); L}
%Y A373467 Cf. A046333 (same with bigomega = 7: counting prime factors with multiplicity), A046397 (same but only squarefree terms), A373465 (same with omega = 5), A046396 (same with omega = 6).
%Y A373467 Cf. A002113 (palindromes), A176655 (omega(.) = 7), A123321 (products of 7 distinct primes).
