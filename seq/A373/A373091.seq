%N A373091 Coefficients of the power series expansion at p=1 of the time constant C(-3,p) for last passage percolation on the complete directed acyclic graph, where the edges' weights are equal to 1 or -3 with respective probabilities p and 1-p.
%C A373091 C(-3,p) is also the speed of the front for an interacting particle system with 4 bins, which corresponds to the particular case of the max-growth system where the probability distribution has two atoms 1 and -3 with respective probabilities p and 1-p.
%C A373091 The first 15 coefficients of this sequence coincide with the first 15 coefficients of A321309.
