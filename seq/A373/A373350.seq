%N A373350 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number such that omega(a(n)) does not equal omega(a(n-1)) or omega(a(n-2)).
%C A373350 The terms of the sequence are initially concentrated along three lines, each line containing terms with either one, two, or three-or-more distinct prime factors. See the attached images. The two lower lines, containing terms with one and two distinct prime factors, cross near n = 66, and then the upper two, containing terms with one and three-or-more distinct prime factors, cross near n = 326. At this point the upper line changes and contains terms with one distinct prime factor but also terms with more than three distinct prime factors. After a large gap the lower two lines, containing terms with two and three distinct prime factors, cross near n = 25308, and then finally, after an even longer gap, the upper two lines, containing all terms except those with three distinct prime factors, merge and become one line near n = 344310. It is likely all subsequent terms fall into one of the two remaining lines, although this is unknown.
%C A373350 A number with one distinct prime factor appears as a term for all n with n mod 3 = 2 up until n = 350, when a(350) = 510 = 2*3*5*17 is smaller than the next unused number with one distinct prime factor. Likewise a number with three distinct prime factors appears as a term for all n with n mod 3 = 1 up until n = 100 when a(100) = 210 = 2*3*5*7 is smaller than the next unused number with three distinct prime factors. However, rather surprisingly, a number with two distinct prime factors appears as a term for all n with n mod 3 = 0 all the way up until n = 344307, when a(344307) = 373215 = 3*5*139*179 is smaller than the next unused number with two distinct prime factors. This value of n corresponds to the start of the merging of the upper two lines near n = 344310 described above.
%C A373350 The fixed points begin 1, 2, 15, 18, 125, 137, 2737, 120051; it is likely no more exist. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
