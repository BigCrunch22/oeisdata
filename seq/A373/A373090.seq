%N A373090 Coefficients of the power series expansion at p=1 of the time constant C(-2,p) for last passage percolation on the complete directed acyclic graph, where the edges' weights are equal to 1 or -2 with respective probabilities p and 1-p.
%C A373090 C(-2,p) is also the speed of the front for an interacting particle system with 3 bins, which corresponds to the particular case of the max-growth system where the probability distribution has two atoms 1 and -2 with respective probabilities p and 1-p.
%C A373090 The first 10 coefficients of this sequence coincide with the first 10 coefficients of A321309.
