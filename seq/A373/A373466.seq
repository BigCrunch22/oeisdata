%N A373466 Palindromes with exactly 6 distinct prime divisors.
%C A373466 The term "exactly" clarifies that we don't mean "at least". But the prime divisors may occur to higher powers in the factorization, cf. Examples.
%C A373466 This is different from A046396 which excludes nonsquarefree terms, i.e., terms where one or more of the distinct prime factors occur to a power greater than 1, as it is possible here, cf. Examples.
%F A373466 Intersection of A002113 and A074969.
%e A373466 a(1) = 222222 = 2 * 3 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 37 has exactly 6 distinct prime divisors.
%e A373466 a(3) = 414414 = 2 * 3^2 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 23 has 6 distinct prime divisors, even though the factor 3 occurs twice in the factorization.
