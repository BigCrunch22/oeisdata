%N A373604 a(n) = 1 if the sum of even-indiced digits and the sum of odd-indiced digits in the primorial base representation (A049345) of 6*n are equal modulo 3, otherwise 0.
%C A373604 a(n) = 1 if the multiplicities of prime factors of A276086(6*n) [all by necessity > 3] that are even-indexed (A031215) and odd-indexed (A031368) are equal modulo 3, otherwise 0.
%C A373604 First n where a(n) = a(n-1) = 1 are 105, 210, 315, 420, 525, 630, ...

%e A373604 For n=3, we have A049345(3*6) = 300, thus the sum of digits in even positions (when the rightmost digit is considered to be in the position 0), which here is 3, and the sum of digits in odd positions, which here is 0, are equal modulo 3, and therefore a(3) = 1.
%e A373604 For n=6, A049345(6*6) = 1100, thus the sum of digits in even positions (1) and in odd positions (1) are equal modulo 3, and a(6) = 1.
%e A373604 For n=9, A049345(9*6) = 1400, thus the sum of digits in even positions (4) and in odd positions (1) are equal modulo 3, and a(9) = 1.
