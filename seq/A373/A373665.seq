%N A373665 Positive integers that cannot be written as a sum of a practical number and a 16-gonal number.
%C A373665 Somu and Tran (2024) proved that there are infinitely many such integers. More generally, infinitely many positive integers cannot be written as a sum of a practical number and an s-gonal number if s is congruent to 4 modulo 12.
