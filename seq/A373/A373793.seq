%N A373793 First differences of A373792, halved.
%C A373793 The offset is 38, because up to that point the terms are not integers.
%C A373793 It appears that in A373390 the primes up to and including 157 (which is A373390(335)) appear irregularly. The next prime is 163 = A373390(350). So there is a possibility that ignoring the first 347 or so terms of A373390 may make it easier to analyze.  A formula or other explanation for the present sequence would be of great help.
