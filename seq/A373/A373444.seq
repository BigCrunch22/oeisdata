%N A373444 Positive integers that cannot be written as a sum of a practical number and a heptagonal number.
%C A373444 Somu and Tran (2024) conjectured that there are finitely many such integers. It was also conjectured that 79445 is the largest such integer. This conjecture was checked up to 10^8.
