%N A373357 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 15; for n > 3, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number that is coprime to a(n-1), shares a factor with a(n-2), while omega(a(n)) does not equal omega(a(n-1)) or omega(a(n-2)).
%C A373357 The sequence uses the same rules for selecting the next term as the Yellowstone permutation A098550 but with the additional restriction that the number of distinct prime factors of a(n) must be different to both a(n-1) and a(n-2). The terms show complicated behavior, being concentrated along various curved and straight lines some of which cross and some of which only have points for various ranges of n. See the attached images.
%C A373357 The fixed points begin 1, 2, 32, 51, although it is possible more exist. The sequence is likely to be a permutation of the positive integers.
