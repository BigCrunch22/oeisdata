%N A373373 Numbers k for which both A001414(k) and A276085(k) are multiples of 3, where A001414 is the sum of prime factors with repetition and A276085 is the primorial base log-function.
%C A373373 As A001414 and A276085 are both fully additive, this sequence forms a multiplicative semigroup: if m and n are in the sequence, then so is m*n.
