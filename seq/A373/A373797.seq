%N A373797 a(n) = maximal k such that there exists a sequence S = [s_1, s_2, ..., s_k] with s_i distinct and in the range 1 <= s_i <= n such that if any s_i is divisible by a prime p, then p also divides exactly one of s_{i-1} and s_{i+1}.
%C A373797 This is a finite version of the "cup of coffee" sequence A280864.
%C A373797 An obvious upper bound is a(n) <= n-C, where C is the number of primes p <= n such that 2*p > n. For example a(4) <= 3, since we cannot make use of the prime 3.
%C A373797 Note that for a prime p <= n/2, the number of terms in S that are divisible by p must be even. So if floor(n/p) is odd for any p <= n/2, we have a(n) <= n-C-1.
%C A373797 When going from n=p-1 to n=p (where p is a prime), the new p cannot be used, so a(p) = a(p-1) for p prime.
%C A373797 We can obtain a sequence of lower bounds by taking S to consist of the first A280774(m) terms of A280864, for m = 1,2,3,...  This gives
%C A373797    a(m) >= max_{1 <= i <= A280774(m)} A280864(i).... (**)
%C A373797  For example, with m=4, we can take the first A280774(4) = 10 terms of A280864, that is, the sequence S = 1,2,4,3,6,8,5,10,12,9, to get a(12) >= 10.  In fact equality holds: a(12) = 10 (see EXAMPLES below).
%C A373797 It is possible that equality will always hold in (**). (**) gives a(4) >= 3, a(8) >= 6, a(12) >= 10, a(16) >= 13 (equality holds up to this point), then a(28) >= 23, a(45) >= 27, ...
%C A373797 From _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jul 27 2024 (Start)
%C A373797 a(24) = 19 so a(25) >= 19. Here is an argument that shows that a(25) = 20 is impossible. We can't use 13 17 19 23. There are 5 multiples of 5 we could use, 5 10 15 20 25, but we can only use 4 of them.  There are 3 multiples of 7 we could use, namely 7 14 21, but we can only use 2 of them. These two lists are disjoint. So a(25) >= 25 - 4 - 2 = 19.
%C A373797 I suspect that a(26) = 20, from 1 / 2 4 / 3 6 10 15 12 8 / 11 22 24 21 7 / 13 26 18 9 / 5 25 /.

%e A373797 Solutions for small n (note that the solutions are a long way from being unique):

%e A373797   12   10       1,2,4,3,6,8,5,10,12,9
%e A373797   14   11       1,2,4,3,6,10,5,7,14,12,9
%e A373797   16   13       1,2,4,3,6,8,5,10,12,9,7,14,16
%e A373797 As an example, let us verify that the prime-divisibility condition holds for the n=14 solution (we write Y to indicate divisibility):
%e A373797   S = 1,2,4,3,6,10,5,7,14,12,9
%e A373797   2?....Y.Y...Y..Y......Y..Y..
%e A373797   3?........Y.Y............Y.Y
%e A373797   5?.............Y.Y..........
%e A373797   7?.................Y..Y.....
%e A373797 The Y's occur in disjoint pairs, as required.
%e A373797 Also, a(18) = 14, from S = 1,8,16,3,6,14,7,5,15,18,4,9,12,2. (We cannot use 11, 13, and 17, and there are an odd number of multiples of 2 and of 5, so we must lose at least one more term - we can take care of this by sacrificing 10 - so 18-4 = 14 is optimal. This implies a(19) = 14 also.)
