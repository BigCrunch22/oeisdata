%N A373797 a(n) = maximal k such that there exists a sequence S = [s_1, s_2, ..., s_k] with s_i distinct and in the range 1 <= s_i <= n such that if any s_i is divisible by a prime p, then p also divides exactly one of s_{i-1} and s_{i+1}.
%C A373797 This is a finite version of the "cup of coffee" sequence A280864.
%C A373797 An obvious upper bound is a(n) <= n-C, where C is the number of primes p <= n such that 2*p > n. For example a(4) <= 3, since we cannot make use of the prime 3.
%C A373797 When going from n=p-1 to n=p (where p is a prime), the new p cannot be used, so a(p) = a(p-1).
%C A373797 We can obtain a sequence of lower bounds by taking S to consist of the first A280774(m) terms of A280864, for m = 1,2,3,...  This gives a(m) >= max_{1 <= i <= A280774(m)} A280864(i). For example, with m=4, we can take the first A280774(4) = 10 terms of A280864, that is, the sequence S = 1,2,4,3,6,8,5,10,12,9, to get a(12) >= 10.  In fact equality holds: a(12) = 10 (see EXAMPLES below). (It is possible that equality will always hold.)
