%N A373514 Number of simple difference sets of the Singer type (m^2 + m + 1, m + 1, 1) that are a superset of {0, 1, 3} with m = m(n) = A000961(n), for n >= 1.
%e A373514 For n=5, m=5, there are 2 Singer type planar difference sets of order 5 containing 0, 1, and 3: {0,1,3,8,12,18} and {0,1,3,10,14,26}. Thus a(5) = 2.
%e A373514 For n=11, m=16, there is only 1 such set: {0,1,3,7,15,31,63,90,116,127,136,181,194,204,233,238,255}. Thus a(11) = 1.
%Y A373514 Cf. A335866, A000961. Counts sets in A333852 with the property that 3 is also in the set.
