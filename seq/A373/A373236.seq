%N A373236 Relative of Hofstadter Q-sequence: a(n) = max(0, n+3201) for n <= 0;  a(n) = a(n-a(n-1)) + a(n-a(n-2)) + a(n-a(n-3)) for n > 0.
%C A373236 Sequences like this are more naturally considered with the first nonzero term in position 1. But this sequence would then match A000027 for its first 3201 terms.
%C A373236 This sequence has exactly 3725 terms (of positive index).  a(3725) = 0, so an attempt to calculate a(3726) would refer to itself.
%C A373236 Without the convention that a(n) = 0 for n <= -3201, this sequence would have exactly 24 terms (of positive index), since computing a(25) refers to a(-6388).
%C A373236 If 3201 in this sequence's definition is replaced by any larger number congruent to 2 mod 7, the behavior is essentially the same, though the quasilinear part (see Formula section) lasts longer.

%F A373236 If the index is between 67 and 3199 (inclusive), then a(7n) = 7n+2, a(7n+1) = 7n+3203, a(7n+2) = 7n+3205, a(7n+3) = 7, a(7n+4) = 2n+6447, a(7n+5) = n+6395, a(7n+6) = 3199.
