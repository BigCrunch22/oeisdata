%N A373732 a(n) = floor(4*n^2/sqrt(3)).
%C A373732 Maximum number of equilateral triangles with unit side, possibly cut into pieces, that can fit into a square of side n without overlapping.
%C A373732 The area of an equilateral triangle with unit side is sqrt(3)/4 (A120011), which gives the number a(n) of such triangles in a square of side n as at most floor(n^2/(sqrt(3)/4)).
%F A373732 a(n) = floor(4*n^2/sqrt(3)).
%e A373732 At most 9 unit equilateral triangles can fit into a square of side 2, so a(2) = 9.
%Y A373732 Cf. A120011.
