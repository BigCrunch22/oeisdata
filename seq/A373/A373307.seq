%N A373307 Binary digits of Pi selected by stepping forward d+1 places at digit d, i.e., by skipping the next d places.
%C A373307 Are the digits uniformly distributed?  Are all digit sequences uniformly distributed?
%F A373307 a(n) = the (n+a(1)+a(2)+...+a(n-1))-th digit in the binary expansion of Pi.
%e A373307 The sequence starts with the first digit of the binary expansion of Pi, which is 1. The next term is the digit 1+1 places after this, namely, 0, and so on.
%e A373307 The digits selected from Pi begin
