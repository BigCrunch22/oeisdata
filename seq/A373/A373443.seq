%N A373443 Positive integers that cannot be written as a sum of a practical number and a hexagonal number.
%C A373443 Somu and Tran (2024) conjectured that there are finitely many such integers. It was also conjectured that 1332329 is the largest such integer. This conjecture was checked up to 10^8.
