%N A373241 T(n,k) is the difference between the number of different parts and the number of different multiplicities in the k-th partition of n in graded reverse lexicographic ordering (A080577)
%C A373241 This difference is always non negative.
%C A373241 The number of zero values in each row is A098859.The number of ones in each row is A325244.The number of positive entries in each row is A336866.
%C A373241 The corresponding regular triangle for partitions of n of length k is A373242.
%C A373241 The sum of each row is A373243.
