%N A204814 Number of decompositions of 2n into an unordered sum of two Ramanujan primes.
%C A204814 Suggested by _John W. Nicholson_.
%C A204814 There are 95 zeros in the first 10000 terms. Are there more? Related to Goldbach's conjecture. - _T. D. Noe_, Jan 27 2012
%C A204814 There are no other zeros in the first 10^8 terms. a(n) > 0 for n from 1313 to 10^8. - _Donovan Johnson_, Jan 27 2012

%e A204814 a(29) = 3. 2*29 = 58 = 11+47 = 17+41 = 29+29 (11, 17, 29, 41 and 47 are all Ramanujan primes). 58 is the unordered sum of two Ramanujan primes in three ways.
