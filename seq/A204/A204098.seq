%N A204098 Numbers n such that there is a triangle with area 1 and rational sides, and one side is the positive integer n.
%C A204098 n is present in the sequence just in case the elliptic curve Y^2 = (n^4+4)*X^4 + 8*n^2*X^3 - 2*(n^4-4)*X^2 - 8*n^2*X + (n^4+4) has positive rank over the rationals. Note (X,Y)=(1,4) is a point on the curve.
%C A204098 Some entries in this sequence and some omissions from the sequence are based on standard conjectures about elliptic curves.
%e A204098 5 is in the sequence because the rational triangle with sides (a, b, c) = (4097/858, 5, 401/858) has area 1 and one side is 5.
