%N A224913 Number of different nonisomorphic antimatroids on n labeled items.
%C A224913 See link for software to generate the sequence. The next item (for n=8) should be roughly 2^63 and seems hopeless without more mathematics.
%C A224913 Antimatroids are a subset of greedoids, usually defined either in terms of set systems, as David Eppstein does in his tree searches, or in terms of formal languages. The two are equivalent, as discussed in Kempner and Levit.

%e A224913 The three antimatroids on the two items 0 and 1 are (a) {},{0},{0,1}, (b) {},{1},{0,1} and (c) {},{0},{1},{0,1}, out of which (a) and (b) are isomorphic, leaving (a)/(b) and (c) as two nonisomorphic antimatroids.
%Y A224913 Cf. A119770 (counts antimatroids, not taking symmetries into account).
