%N A224523 Let {f_n(k)} be the n-th sequence of Fibonacci-like numbers defined by recursion f_n(0) = 0, f_n(1) = 1 and, for k>=2, f_n(k) = f_n(k-1) + f_n(k-2) divided by maximal possible powers of primes >= prime(n). a(n) is length of the smallest period of {f_n(k)}, and a(n)=0, if {f_n(k)} is not eventually periodic.
%C A224523 Conjecture. For n>=1, a(n)>0.
%C A224523 If Conjecture is true, then we have an answer in affirmative on question in A078414.

%e A224523 Let n=9, prime(9)=23. Sequence {f_9(k)} begins 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55. Now 34 + 55 = 89 is prime >=23, so the following terms are 89/89 = 1,56,57. Further, since 56 + 57 = 113 is prime >=23, then the following term is 113/113 = 1 and, since 57 + 1 = 58=29*2, then the following term is 58/29 = 2. Now we have period {1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,1,56,57} with length 12. Thus a(9)=12.
