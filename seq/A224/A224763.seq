%N A224763 Define a sequence of rationals by S(1)=1; for n>=1, write S(1),...,S(n) as XY^k, Y nonempty, where the fractional exponent k is maximized, and set S(n+1)=k; sequence gives denominators of S(1), S(2), ...
%C A224763 k is the "fractional curling number" of S(1),...,S(n). The infinite sequence S(1), S(2), ... is a fractional analog of Gijswijt's sequence A090822.
%C A224763 For the first 1000 terms, 1 <= S(n) <= 2. Is this always true?
