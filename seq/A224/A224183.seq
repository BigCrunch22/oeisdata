%N A224183 Number of halving and tripling steps to reach the last number of the cycle in the Collatz (3x+1) problem for the negative integers (the initial term is not counted).
%C A224183 The Collatz problem with negative numbers is as follows: start with any number n = -1, -2, -3, ... If n is even, divide it by 2, otherwise multiply it by 3 and add 1. Do we always reach a last number of each cycle? It is conjectured that the answer is yes.
%C A224183 A majority of last numbers of each cycle is -1, but it is possible to obtain also -5, -10, -14, -20, -34,....
%H A224183 Michel Lagneau, <a href="/A224183/b224183.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..10000</a>
%e A224183 a(10) = 4 because the trajectory of -10 is -10 -> -5 -> -14 -> -7 -> -20 -> -10 and -10 is the last term of the cycle, hence 4 iterations.
