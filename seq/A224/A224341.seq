%N A224341 Apparently solves the identity: Find sequence A that represents the numbers of ordered compositions of n into the elements of the set {B}; and vice versa.
%C A224341 Represents the numbers of ordered compositions of n using the terms of A224342: (1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 18, 32, ...); such that the latter represents the numbers of ordered compositions of n using the terms of A224341.
%C A224341 It appears that given any sequence of real terms pulled out of a hat S(n); repeated iterates of S(n) -> characteristic function of S(n) -> INVERT transform of the latter -> next sequence, (repeat); will converge upon two alternating sequences A224341 and A224342 as a fixed limit, as to absolute values.
%F A224341 The sequences are obtained by taking iterates as described in the comments. There is no known generating function at the date of this submission.
%e A224341 Given the sequence (1, 0, 0, 0, ...), a few iterates using the rules rapidly converge upon A224341 and A224342.
