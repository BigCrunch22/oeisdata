%N A224481 Positive integers x such that x^2 - 34 is the average of a twin prime pair.
%C A224481 y = x^2 - 34 is one of a family of quadratics y = x^2 + c that produces averages of twin prime pairs. The first 24 negative numbers c that produce averages are congruent to either 0 or 2 (mod 6) (as calculated by maxima), and they differ by no more than 6. Other than that, I have not found an order to the sequence of negative numbers c. The first 11 positive numbers c that produce averages are apparently the beginning of all integers >= 2 that are equivalent to {2,0,2,0...} (mod 6).
%C A224481 If c=2, then the x that satisfy y = x^2 + c are A080149.
%C A224481 Apparently, there are infinitely many numbers c that produce twin prime averages. Here are some of them: (-84, -78, -76, -72, -70, -66, -64, -60, -58, -54, -52, -46, -42, -40, -36, -34, -30, -28, -22, -18, -16, -12, -6, -4, 2, 6, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 24, 26, 30, 32).
%C A224481 Dickson's conjecture implies that this sequence is infinite. Bateman-Horn-Stemmler gives conjectured growth. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Apr 10 2013

%e A224481 26 is in this sequence, because 26^2 - 34 = 642, which is the average of the twin prime pair (641, 643).
