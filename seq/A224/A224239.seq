%N A224239 Number of inequivalent ways to cut an n X n square into squares with integer sides.
%C A224239 Similar to A045846, but now we do not regard dissections which differ by a rotation and/or reflection as distinct.

%e A224239 For n=5, the illustrations (see links) show that the 77 solutions consist of:
%e A224239 4 dissections each with 1 image under the group of the square, for a total of 4,
%e A224239 2 dissections each with 2 images under the group of the square, totaling 4,
%e A224239 26 dissections each with 4 images under the group of the square, totaling 104, and
%e A224239 45 dissections each with 8 images under the group of the square, totaling 360,
%e A224239 for a grand total of 77 dissections with 472 images, agreeing with A045846(5) = 472.
%Y A224239 Main diagonal of A227690.
