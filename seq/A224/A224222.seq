%N A224222 a(0)=3; for n>0, a(n) is the smallest prime q not already in the sequence such that the n-th prime p(n) divides a(n-1)+q. If no such prime q exists, the sequence terminates.
%C A224222 a(20) does not exist, so the sequence terminates. A134204 is a similar sequence for which the termination question is unresolved.
%e A224222 After a(3)=13, to find a(4) we look for a prime q such that the fourth prime, 7, divides 13+q, and q=29 works, since 7 divides 13+29 = 42.
%e A224222 After a(19)=71 we look for a prime q such that p(20)=71 divides 71+q. The only candidate is q=71. Since it is already in the sequence, the sequence terminates.
