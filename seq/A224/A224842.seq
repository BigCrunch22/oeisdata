%N A224842 Decimal expansion of log((1+e)/2).
%C A224842 Positive matrices do not always behave like positive numbers: for instance 0 <= A <= B does not imply e^A <= e^B [e^A stands here for matrix exponential of A, and 0 <= A <= B means that A and B-A are positive matrices, a positive matrix being a matrix which has nonnegative entries]. The counterexample given by Paul Halmos is A = e^{{1/2, 1/2}, {1/2, 1/2}} = {{(1+e)/2, (e-1)/2}, {(e-1)/2, (1+e)/2}} and B = {{e^x, 0}, {0, e^y}}, with x < log((1+e)/2).
