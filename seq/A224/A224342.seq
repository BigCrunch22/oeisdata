%N A224342 Apparently solves the identity: find sequence B that represents the numbers of ordered compositions of n using the terms of A, and vice versa.
%C A224342 It appears that given any sequence of real numbers taken out of a hat, S(n); repeated iterates of the operation: S(n) -> characteristic function of S(n) -> INVERT transform of the latter -> new sequence, then (repeat), will converge upon two sequences A = A224341 and B = A224342 as a 2-cycle fixed limit.
%C A224342 Alternatively as a conjecture, A and B solve the unique identity as described in the heading as to ordered compositions with A = A224341 and B = A224342. The INVERT transform of the characteristic function of A = B, and the INVERT transform of the characteristic function of B = A.
%F A224342 Repeated trials of any sequence of real numbers pulled out of a hat will apparently converge upon A224341 and A224342 as a 2-cycle fixed limit (absolute values of terms).  There is no known generating function at the date of this submission.
%e A224342 Given the sequence (1, 0, 0, 0, ...) and following the iterative rules, the sequences converge upon A224341 and A224342 as an alternating fixed limit.
