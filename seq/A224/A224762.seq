%N A224762 Define a sequence of rationals by S(1)=1; for n>=1, write S(1),...,S(n) as XY^k, Y nonempty, where the fractional exponent k is maximized, and set S(n+1)=k; sequence gives numerators of S(1), S(2), ...
%C A224762 k is the "fractional curling number" of S(1),...,S(n). The infinite sequence S(1), S(2), ... is a fractional analog of Gijswijt's sequence A090822.
%C A224762 For the first 1000 terms, 1 <= S(n) <= 2. Is this always true?
%C A224762 The fractional curling number k of S = (S(1), S(2), ..., S(n)) is defined as follows. Write S = X Y Y ... Y Y' where X may be empty, Y is nonempty, there are say i copies of Y, and Y' is a prefix of Y. There may be many ways to do this. Choose the version in which the ratio k = (i|Y|+|Y'|)/|Y| is maximized; this k is the fractional curling number of S.
%C A224762 For example, if S = (S(1), ..., S(6)) = (1, 1, 2, 1, 3/2, 1), the best choice is to take X = 1,1,2, Y = 1,3/2, Y' = 1, giving k = (2+1)/2 = 3/2 = S(7).
