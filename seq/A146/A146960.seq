%N A146960 Odd squarefree numbers n such that the cyclotomic polynomial Phi(n,x) is not coefficient convex.
%C A146960 Gallot and Moree say that a cyclotomic polynomial is coefficient convex if the union of the coefficients is a range of consecutive integers. They prove that if n is ternary (the product of three distinct odd primes), then Phi(n,x) is coefficient convex. All numbers in this sequence have more than three odd prime factors.
