%N A146290 Triangle T(n,m) read by rows (n >= 1, 0 <= m <= A061394(n)), giving the number of divisors of A025487(n) with m distinct prime factors.
%C A146290 The formula used in obtaining the A025487(n)th row (see below) also gives the number of divisors of the k-th power of A025487(n).
%C A146290 Every row that appears in A146289 appears exactly once in the table. Rows appear in order of first appearance in A146289.
%C A146290 T(n,0)=1.

%e A146290 36's 9 divisors include 1 divisor with 0 distinct prime factors (1); 4 with 1 (2, 3, 4 and 9); and 4 with 2 (6, 12, 18 and 36). Since 36 = A025487(11), the 11th row of the table therefore reads (1, 4, 4). These are the positive coefficients of the polynomial equation 1 + 4k + 4k^2 = (1 + 2k)(1 + 2k), derived from the prime factorization of 36 (namely, 2^2*3^2).
%Y A146290 For the number of distinct prime factors of n, see A001221.
%Y A146290 Row sums equal A146288(n). T(n, 1)=A036041(n) for n>1. T(n, A061394(n))=A052306(n).
%Y A146290 Row A098719(n) of this table is identical to row n of A007318.
