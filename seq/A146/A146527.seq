%N A146527 a(n) = number of distinct composites, when each is represented in binary, that occur as substrings within the binary representation of n.
%C A146527 a(n) = 0 for n equal to only the positive integers 1,2,3,5,7,11,23 (sequence A048278).
%e A146527 20 in binary is 10100. The composites, when represented in binary, that can be found within 10100 are 4 = 100 in binary, 10 (decimal) = 1010 in binary and 20 itself = 10100 in binary. There are 3 of these composites, so a(20) = 3.
