%N A146524 a(n) is the largest nonnegative integer m such that 2*n*k+1 is prime for all k where 1<=k<=m. a(n) = 0 if 2n+1 is composite.
%e A146524 For n = 3: 2*3*1 +1 = 7, which is prime. 2*3*2 + 1 = 13, which is prime. 2*3*3 + 1 = 19, which is prime. But 2*3*4 + 1 = 25, which is composite. So a(3) = 3, because there are 3 primes in the arithmetic sequence before hitting a composite.
