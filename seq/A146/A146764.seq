%N A146764 Primes not in A075255.
%C A146764 It has been asked whether A146071 contains all primes. The answer is no: since A075255(n) > n/2-2 for nonprime n, any prime p that did not appear until the rank 2(p+2) is not in A075255. This is a sufficient condition for not being in A146071, but unless proved otherwise, there may be primes in A075255, i.e., not listed here, which nevertheless do not appear in A146071.
