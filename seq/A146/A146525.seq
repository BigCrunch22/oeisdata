%N A146525 a(n) is the largest nonnegative integer m such that 2*n*k-1 is prime for all k where 1<=k<=m. a(n) = 0 if 2n-1 is composite.
%e A146525 For n = 3: 2*3*1 -1 = 5, which is prime. 2*3*2 - 1 = 11, which is prime. 2*3*3 - 1 = 17, which is prime. 2*3*4 -1 = 23, which is prime. 2*3*5 -1 = 29, which is prime. But 2*3*6 - 1 = 35, which is composite. So a(3) = 5, because there are 5 primes in the arithmetic sequence before hitting a composite.
