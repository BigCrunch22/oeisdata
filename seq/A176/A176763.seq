%N A176763 Smallest power of 3 whose decimal expansion contains n.
%C A176763 This is to 3 as A030001 is to 2.
%F A176763 a(n) = MIN{A000244(i) such that n in decimal representation is a substring of A000244(i)}.
%e A176763 a(1) = 1 because 3^0 = 1 has "1" as a substring (not a proper substring, though).
%e A176763 a(2) = 27 because 3^3 = 27 has "2" as a substring.
%e A176763 a(10) = 10460353203 because 3^21 = 10460353203 is the smallest power of 3 whose decimal expansion contains "10" (in this case, "10" happens to be the left-hand or initial digits, but that is not generally true).
%Y A176763 Cf. A000244, A030000, A030001, A063565, A018856.
