%N A176803 a(n) = the smallest natural numbers m such that product of antiharmonic mean of the divisors of n and antiharmonic mean of the divisors of m are integers, a(n) = 0 if no such number exists.
%C A176803 Antiharmonic mean of the divisors of number n is rational number b(n) = A001157(n) / A000203(n) = A158274(n) / A158275(n). a(n) = 1 for infinitely many n. a(n) = 1 for numbers from A020487: a(A020487(n)) = 1. a(n) = 1 iff A158275(n) = 1. a(n) = 0 for infinitely many n. a(n) = 0 for even A158275(n).
%e A176803 For n = 10; b(10) = 65/9, a(n) = 100 because b(100) = 63; 65/9 * 63 = 455 (integer).
