%N A176498 Number of elements less than 1/2 in the Cross Set which is the subset of the set of distinct resistances that can be produced using n unit resistors in series and/or parallel.
%C A176498 This sequence arises in the decomposition of the sets A(n + 1) of equivalent resistances, when n equal resistors are combined in series/parallel, into series parallel and cross sets respectively. All the elements of the parallel set are strictly less than 1 and all those of the series set are strictly greater than 1. The cross set is expected to be dense around 1 with very few elements below 1/2. Hence it is relevant to count the elements below 1/2.
