%N A176039 Primitive elements of A071562.
%C A176039 Members of A071562 which cannot be expressed as the product of two smaller elements of that sequence.
%C A176039 This definition is made to include 1; it would make about as much sense to exclude it.
%C A176039 This sequence includes all numbers of the form a*p, where p/2 < a <= p, for p prime. It also includes all p*q*r, where p, q, and r are odd primes, and p*q/2 < r < p*q. Similar but increasingly complex conditions can be made for products of more primes.
%e A176039 4 is not in the sequence, because 4 = 2*2, and 2 is in A071562.
