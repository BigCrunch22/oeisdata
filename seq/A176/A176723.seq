%N A176723 Characteristic array for partitions which define multiset repetition classes.
%C A176723 For the definition of multisets see, e.g., Stanley, p. 15.
%C A176723 Partitions of natural numbers n are ordered according to Abramowitz-Stegun (A-St) order.
%C A176723 Partitions of n>=1 are written in the exponent form (1^e[1], 2^e[2], 3^e[3],..., n^e[n]) with e[j] nonnegative numbers, for j=1,2,...,n, sum(e[j],j=1..n)=m (number of parts), and sum(j*e[j],j=1..n)=n. The empty partition for n=0 defines the empty multiset. In A115621 the multiset/partition of positive exponents is called the signature of the partition.
%C A176723 The classes being represented are the classes with the same signature.
%C A176723 Definition of multiset repetition class defining partitions: Every m part partition of n which has positive nonincreasing exponents defines a representative of a multiset repetition class of order m (a special m-multiset); i.e., the exponents of such partitions satisfy e[1] >= e[2] >= ... >= e[M] >= 1 with largest part M. This will satisfy T(M) <= n where T(M) = A000217(M) is the sequence of triangular numbers; for n>=1 every sufficiently small positive M does occur.
%C A176723 Note that for each multiset repetition class the chosen defining partition (its representative) is the one with least n.
%C A176723 See below for some examples.

%F A176723 a(n,k)=1 if the k-th partition of n in A-St order (see above for the abbreviation A-St and a reference) is multiset defining and 0 else. The definition of a multiset repetition class defining partition is given above. See the examples below.

%e A176723 For n=6 the entry 1 at the 6th position stands for the partition (1^1,2^1,3^1)=(1,2,3) in A-St order.
%e A176723 The m=3 multiset corresponding to partition (1,2,3) coincides with the ordinary 3-set {1,2,3}.
%e A176723 Partition (1^4,2^1) = (1^4,2) (marking the next-to-last entry in row n=6) corresponds to the (m=5)-multiset {1,1,1,1,2}.
