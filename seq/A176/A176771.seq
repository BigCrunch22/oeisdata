%N A176771 Smallest power of 12 whose decimal expansion contains n.
%C A176771 This is to 12 as A176763 is to 3 and as A030001 is to 2.
%F A176771 a(n) = MIN{A001021(i) such that n in decimal representation is a substring of A001021(i)}.
%e A176771 a(1) = 1 because 12^0 = 1 has "1" as a substring (not a proper substring, though).
%e A176771 a(2) = 12 because 12^1 = 12 has "2" as a substring.
%e A176771 a(3) = 20736 because 12^4 = 20736 has "3" as a substring.
%Y A176771 Cf. A001018, A030001, A176763, A176764-A176773.
