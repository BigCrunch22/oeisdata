%N A176744 The squares A000290 and the integers which cannot be represented as a sum of two earlier terms of the sequence.
%e A176744 3 is the smallest number which is not a sum of 2 numbers of {0,1}. Therefore 3 in the sequence.
%e A176744 4 is a square, and included as such.
%e A176744 5 can be represented by 1+4 (both already in the sequence) and is not included; 6=3+3, 7=3+4, 8=4+4 are also sums of earlier terms: not included.
%e A176744 11 is the smallest number which is not a sum of 2 numbers of {0, 1, 3, 4, 9}. Therefore 11 in the sequence.
