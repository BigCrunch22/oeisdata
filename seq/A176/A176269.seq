%N A176269 Decimal expansion of the value of d that maximizes the area of a triangle whose angles form a harmonic progression in the ratio 1 : 1/(1-d) : 1/(1-2d), whose side length opposite the largest or smallest angle remains constant and for d in the interval [-oo, 1/2] where 1/(1-d) and 1/(1-2d) are always positive.
%C A176269 If the angles of a triangle form a harmonic progression in the ratio 1 : 1/(1-d) : 1/(1-2d) where d is the common difference between the denominators of the harmonic progression, then the angles are expressed as
%C A176269   Pi*(1-d)*(1-2d)/(2d^2-6d+3), Pi*(1-2d)/(2d^2-6d+3), Pi*(1-d)/(2d^2-6d+3).
%C A176269 When d = 0.3778323013... it uniquely maximizes the area of this triangle for a constant side length opposite the largest or smallest angle. This triangle has approximate internal angles 26.866 degrees, 43.181 degrees, 109.953 degrees.
