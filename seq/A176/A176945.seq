%N A176945 Semiprimes s such that r=(s^2+1)/2 is also a semiprime.
%C A176945 Semiprimes which are a leg of an integral right triangle whose hypotenuse is also semiprime. This is to A048161 as semiprimes A001358 are to primes A000040. All terms must be odd (else r is not an integer).
%F A176945 {s such that s = p_1 * q_1 for p_1, q_1 primes, and  r=(s^2+1)/2 = p_2 * q_2 for p_2, q_2 primes}.
%e A176945 a(1) = 21 because 21 = 3*7 is semiprime, and (21^2+1)/2 = 221 = 13 * 17 is semiprime.
%e A176945 a(2) = 33 because 33 = 3 * 11 is semiprime, and (33^2+1)/2 = 545 = 5 * 109 is semiprime.
%e A176945 a(3) = 55 because 55 = 5 * 11 is semiprime, and (55^2+1)/2 = 1513 = 17 * 89 is semiprime.
