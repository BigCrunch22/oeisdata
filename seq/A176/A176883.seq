%N A176883 Sum of distances of numbers between successive powers of 2 (beginning with 2^1) to previous numbers with same number of prime factors, repetitions included. See example.
%e A176883 On (2,3,4), between the powers of 2, 3 is one number beyond previous prime 2. So the sum is 1. On (4,5,6,7,8), 5 is 2 beyond 3, 6 is 2 beyond 4, 7 is 2 beyond 5, for a sum of 2+2+2=6. On (8,9,10,11,12, 13,14,15,16), the distances are 3,1,4,4,2,4,1 for a sum of 19. And so on.
