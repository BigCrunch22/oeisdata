%N A176117 Primes p such that T(p) is prime in Juricevic conjecture on classification of Lehmer triples.
%C A176117 Tsumura: In paper on a classification of Lehmer triples, Juricevic conjectured that there are infinitely many primes of special form. We disprove one of his conjectures and consider the other one. Let us consider T(p). Now T(p) is not composite for all primes p. For example, T(p) is prime for p = 2, 5, 809. (These are the only primes the author found.) Although we neither prove nor disprove Conjecture 1.1, we can show that there are infinitely many primes p such that T(p) is composite.
%C A176117 Primes p such that A110035(2p) is prime. The value after 809 is > 2741. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jul 22 2010
