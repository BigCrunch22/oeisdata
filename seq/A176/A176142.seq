%N A176142 Number of nonequivalent monoids of order n in which the action of the unit group on the maximal ideal is nontrivial.
%C A176142 Monoids are considered to be equivalent when they are isomorphic or anti-isomorphic (by reversal of the operator).
%C A176142 The invertible elements form the unit group of the monoid, all remaining elements form the maximal ideal.
