%N A176772 Smallest power of 13 whose decimal expansion contains n.
%C A176772 This is to 13 as A176763 is to 3 and as A030001 is to 2.
%F A176772 a(n) = MIN{A001022(i) such that n in decimal representation is a substring of A001022(i)}.
%e A176772 a(1) = 1 because 13^0 = 1 has "1" as a substring (not a proper substring, though).
%e A176772 a(2) = 2197 because 13^3 = 2197 has "2" as a substring.
%e A176772 a(3) = 13 because 13^1 = 13 has "3" as a substring.
%Y A176772 Cf. A001022, A030001, A176763, A176764-A176773.
