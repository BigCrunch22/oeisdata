%N A176494 Least m >= 1 for which |2^m - prime(n)| is prime.
%C A176494 a(n)=1 iff p_n is second of twin primes (A006512); for n > 4, a(n)=2 iff p_n is second of cousin primes (A046132). It is interesting to continue this sequence in order to find big jumps such as a(31)-a(30). Is it true that such jumps can be arbitrarily large, either (a) in the sense of differences a(n+1)-a(n), or (b) in the sense of ratios a(n+1)/a(n)?
%C A176494 Conjecture. For every odd prime p, the sequence {|2^n - p|} contains at least one prime. The record values of the sequence appear at n = 2, 10, 31, 68, 341, ... and are 3, 4, 47, 791, ... Note that up to now the value a(341) is not known. _Charles R Greathouse IV_ calculated the following two values: a(815)=16464, a(591)=58091 and noted that a(341) is much larger [private communication, May 27 2010]. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, May 29 2010
