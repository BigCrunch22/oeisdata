%N A176210 Triangle read by rows in which row n (n>=3) lists those partitions of n with every part > 2.
%C A176210 Each partition is listed in nonincreasing order.
%C A176210 The partitions in each row are listed in decreasing lexicographic order.
%C A176210 Also the numbers of vertices of the connected components of the 2-regular simple graphs on n vertices.
