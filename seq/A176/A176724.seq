%N A176724 Triangle for number of partitions which define multiset repetition classes.
%C A176724 For definitions, references, links and examples see the corresponding partition array A176723.
%C A176724 Row sums coincide with those of array A176723 for n>=1, and they are given by A007294.
%C A176724 If for n=0 a 1 is added (the empty partition defines the empty multiset class) the tabl structure will be lost.

%F A176724 a(n,m) is the number of m part partitions of n which define m-multiset repetition classes. Multiset repetition class defining is equivalent to the following constraint on the exponents of a partition (1^e[1],2^e[2],...,M^e[M]):
%F A176724   e[1] >= e[2]>=...>=e[M]>=1, i.e., positive nonincreasing with largest part M. This will satisfy T(M) <= n where T(M) = A000217(M) are the triangular numbers; for each n every sufficiently small positive M does occur.

%Y A176724 a(7,5)=1 because there is only one 5 part partition of 7 which is 5-multiset repetition class defining, namely (1^3,2^2) (see row n=7 of the partition array A176723). This defines the 5-multiset class representative {1,1,1,2,2}.
