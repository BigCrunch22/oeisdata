%N A176028 The digit leading in the digits-of-Pi race after n decimal digits.
%C A176028 That is, we count the frequency of each of the ten digits 0-9 in the first n digits of Pi and set a(n)=d, where d is the digit with the highest frequency. If there is a tie, we take the least digit. Surprisingly, in the first 10^8 digits, the digit 6 never has the lead, the digit 0 has the lead only 516 times, and the digit 4 has the lead over 71% of the time. Is this the behavior of a normal number?

%e A176028 The first 20 digits of Pi are 3.1415926535897932384. After the initial 3, it is clear that 1 has the lead until the 11th digit, when the third 5 occurs.
