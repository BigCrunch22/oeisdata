%N A152672 a(n) is the number of distinct tuples of up to k bit locations in L-bit words, in which, if bits are perturbed, the resulting change in unsigned L-bit value is n, for L=8 and k=7.
%e A152672 For n=5, a(5) = 16, i.e., there are 16 possible tuples of up to k bit positions in L-bit words, in which, if the bits corresponding to the tuple are perturbed, can lead to a change in the word's unsigned value by 5, for L=8 and k=7. For n=254, a(254) = 1, i.e., there is only one tuple of up to k bit positions in an L-bit word, for which, if the bits are perturbed, will lead to a change in the word's value by 254, for L=8 and k=7; this tuple corresponds to perturbing all but the least significant bit in a word of all zeros or all ones.
%Y A152672 For a given n, while a(n) in this sequence gives the number of distinct tuples of up to k bit positions that may be perturbed to yield a change in value of n, A152524 gives the number of ways (accounting for both positions and types of perturbations, i.e., whether 0->1 or 1->0) in which up to k bit positions in an L-bit word may be perturbed, to yield a change in the word's value, of n, for L=8 and k=7.
