%N A152519 Numbers k such that 2*A064413(k) = 3*k.
%C A152519 The EKG sequence A064413 has 3 critical lines.
%C A152519 Points which belong to the critical lines:
%C A152519 (1) A064413(k) = k see A152458,
%C A152519 (3/2) 2*A064413(k) = 3*k see this sequence,
%C A152519 (1/2) 2*A064413(k) = k contains only 2 numbers: {10, 14}.
%C A152519 Only 12 and 16 in this sequence are not of the form 2*prime.
%C A152519 Because points are concentrated on the plot of EKG sequence near these 3 critical lines, the number of points belonging to critical lines is surprisingly low.
%C A152519 Conjecture: Number of points on 3 critical lines of EKG sequence is finite (and complete?). - _Artur Jasinski_, Dec 08 2008
