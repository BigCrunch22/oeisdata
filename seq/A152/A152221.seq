%N A152221 a(n) = the largest integer k where the binary representations of both k and of k+1 occur as substrings in the binary representation of n. a(n) = 0 if n = 2^m -1, for m = any positive integer.
%C A152221 If n = 2^m -1, then there is no pair of consecutive positive integers that, when represented in binary, occur as substrings in the binary representation of n. For n = any positive integer not of the form 2^m -1, there is always at least one positive integer k such that the binary representations of both k and k+1 occur as substrings in the binary representation of n.
%e A152221 12 represented in binary is 1100. a(12) = 3 because the binary representation of 3 (which is 11) occurs in 1100 (like so: (11)00), the binary representation of 4 (which is 100) occurs in 1100 (like so: 1(100)) and no larger pair of consecutive integers occurs within 1100.
