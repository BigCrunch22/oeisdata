%N A152959 Number of correlation classes for pairs of different words in an alphabet of size 4.
%C A152959 Let b(m,q) be the number of correlation classes of pairs of different q-ary words of length m, per the definition of sequence A152139. Then here a(m)=b(m,4), the number of correlation classes of pairs of different words of length m in an alphabet of size 4. In other words, for m>1, a(m)=c(m*(m-1)+4), where c is given by A152139. A conjecture mentioned in the comments to A152139 translates here to b(m,q) = a(m) for all q > 4. For more details, see the comments in A152139.
