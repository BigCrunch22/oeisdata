%N A152149 Decimal expansion of the angle B in the doubly golden triangle ABC.
%C A152149 There is a unique (shape of) triangle ABC that is both side-golden and angle-golden. Its angles are B, C=t*B and A=pi-B-t*B, where t is the golden ratio. "Angle-golden" and "side-golden" refer to partitionings of ABC, each in a manner that matches the continued fraction [1,1,1,...] of t.  (The partitionings are analogous to the partitioning of the golden rectangle into squares by the removal of exactly 1 square at each stage.)
%C A152149 For doubly silver and doubly e-ratio triangles, see A188543 and A188544.
%C A152149 For the side partitioning and angle partitioning (i,e, constructions) which match arbitrary continued fractions (of sidelength ratios and angle ratios), see the 2007 reference.
