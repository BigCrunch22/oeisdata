%N A152077 Length of the trajectory of the map x->A003132(x) started at x=n^2 up to the end of its first period.
%C A152077 This accumulates the length of the "transient" or "pre-periodic" part of the trajectory started at n^2 plus the length of the first period.
%F A152077 a(n) = A099645(n^2)+A031176(n^2) .
%e A152077 a(5)=11 since the trajectory starting at x=5^2 is 25, 29, 85, 89, 145, 42, 20, 4, 16, 37, 58 the next term 89 is already there.
%e A152077 a(10)= 2 since the trajectory starting at x=10^2 is 100,1 and the next term is again the 1.
%e A152077 a(11)= 18 because the trajectory is 121, 6, 36, 45, 41, 17, 50, 25, 29, 85, 89, 145, 42, 20, 4, 16, 37, 58, the next 89 is already there.
%Y A152077 Cf. A031176, A160862.
