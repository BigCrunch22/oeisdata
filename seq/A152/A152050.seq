%N A152050 Smallest lower twin prime tp such that p + tp + 1 is prime. p ranges over the prime numbers.
%C A152050 Conjecture: For all primes p <= n there is always a lower twin prime L less than n such that p+L+1 is prime.
%e A152050 29 is the 9th odd prime. 29+3+1, 29+5+1 are not prime. 29+11+1 is prime, so a(9) = 11 the smallest lower twin prime satisfying the definition for prime 29.
