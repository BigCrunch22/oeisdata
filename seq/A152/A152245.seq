%N A152245 Primes p where |p-m| = 1, where m is any of the smallest positive integers with their number of divisors. (m belongs to sequence A007416.)
%e A152245 The smallest positive integer with 8 divisors is 24. 24 - 1 = 23 is prime. But 24 + 1 = 25 is composite. So 23 is in the sequence, while 25 is not.
