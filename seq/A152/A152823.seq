%N A152823 Largest divisor < n of n^2 + 1, a(1) = 1.
%C A152823 If a(2k) = 3, then 4k^2 + 1 = 3p with p prime. For odd n > 1, a(n) >= 2, with equality if (n^2+1)/2 is prime. Conversely, A147809(n) = 1 iff n^2 + 1 is a semiprime, which for odd n > 1 implies a(n) = 2.
%C A152823 a(1) = 1 by convention, which is compatible with the FORMULA (a(n) = 1 iff n^2 + 1 is prime) and also with a(n) = the floor(d/2)-th divisor of n^2+1, when d is its total number of divisors, cf. PROGRAM. - _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 11 2019
