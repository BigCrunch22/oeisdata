%e A152946 a(4)=1 because when forming an edge-magic injection of K_4 we must use at least the first 10 natural numbers {1,2,...,10} since K_4 has a total of 10 vertices and edges. However, this is not possible. But there is an edge-magic injection of K_4 using the set {1,2,...,11}\{4}, with largest label 11.
%e A152946 Hence the magic deficiency of K_4 is a(4)=11-10=1.
%Y A152946 See sequence A152682. The n-th term of the magic deficiency sequence equals the n-th term of sequence A152682 minus "n+{n choose 2}".
%Y A152946 (The number "n+{n choose 2}" is the total number of vertices and edges in K_n.)
%Y A152946 See also sequence A129413 which concerns the smallest value of the magic sum of an edge-magic injection of K_n.
