%N A152222 a(n) = the smallest positive integer m such that A152221(m) = n.
%e A152222 12 represented in binary is 1100. A152221(12) = 3 because the binary representation of 3 (which is 11) occurs in 1100 (like so: (11)00), the binary representation of 4 (which is 100) occurs in 1100 (like so: 1(100)) and no larger pair of consecutive integers occurs within 1100. Since no positive integer m, m < 12, is such that A152221(m) = 3, then a(3) = 12.
