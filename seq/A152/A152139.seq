%N A152139 Correlation classes of pairs of different words.
%C A152139 Let b(m,q) be the number of correlation classes of pairs of different q-ary words of length m.
%C A152139 Then a(m*(m-1)+q) = b(m,q), for q from 1 to 2*m.
%C A152139 A correlation class for a pair of different words is defined as an equivalence class of 2*2 correlation matrices, M=[XX XY; YX YY], where X and Y are different words of length m in an alphabet of size q, and the correlations XX, XY, YX, YY are binary words of length m as defined by Guibas and Odlyzko [Section 1].
%C A152139 The equivalence relation is given by equivalence under transpose of the matrix and equivalence under exchange of X and Y.
%C A152139 Rahmann and Rivals [Section 3.3] call the equivalence classes "types of correlation matrices".
%C A152139 Trivially, b(m,q) = b(m,2*m) for q > 2*m.
%C A152139 Given the first terms of the sequence above, an obvious conjecture is that b(m,q) = b(m,4) for all q > 4.
%C A152139 Conjecture that b(m,q) = b(m,4) for all q > 4, is now verified for m to and including 8. Also b(9,q)=b(9,4) for q=5,6,7,8 at least. - _Paul Leopardi_, Jun 14 2009

%F A152139 See the generating function for the "absence probability of both P and Q in a text of length m" given in Lemma 3.2 of Rahmann and Rivals.
%F A152139 This generating function uses the polynomial form of the correlation matrix and for a given length m and alphabet size q, each correlation class yields a distinct generating function.
%e A152139 Rahmann and Rivals [Table 1] have b(2,q) = 6 for q >= 4.
