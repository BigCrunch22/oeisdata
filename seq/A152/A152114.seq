%N A152114 Numbers a(n) are obtained by the application of an algorithm which is similar to sieve of Eratosthenes for A000045: retaining A000045(3)=2, we delete all multiples of 2, which are more than 2; retaining A000045(4)=3, we delete all multiples of 3, which are more than 3, etc.
%C A152114 Since, as known, A000045((m,n))=(A000045(m),A000045(n)), then the indices of a(n) as terms of A000045, i.e., 3,4,5,7,11,13,..., except of 4, are the consecutive odd primes.
%C A152114 Apparently a variant of A030426. [From _R. J. Mathar_, Nov 27 2008]
