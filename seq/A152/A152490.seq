%N A152490 Determinants of first 4x4 part of A051731 whose columns has been shifted with sequence A152489.
%C A152490 The idea is to shift the columns in A051731 one column one step at a time like the changing symbols in a slot machine. For example a(1)=1 is the unshifted version of A051731 and for a(4)=0, the last column has been shifted 3 steps upwards, which is the fourth value of the mobius function. Sequence contains equally many values of 1,-1 and 0.
%e A152490 The 3x3 array is shorter to write down:
%e A152490 By using indices similar to array A152489;
%e A152490 0,0,0; 0,0,1; 0,0,2; 0,1,0; 0,1,1; 0,1,2;
%e A152490 the columns in A051731 are shifted like in a slot machine;
%e A152490 1,0,0; 1,0,0; 1,0,1; 1,1,0; 1,1,0; 1,1,1;
%e A152490 1,1,0; 1,1,1; 1,1,0; 1,0,0; 1,0,1; 1,0,0;
%e A152490 1,0,1; 1,0,0; 1,0,0; 1,1,1; 1,1,0; 1,1,0;
%e A152490 and the determinants are then:
%e A152490 1; 0; -1; -1; 0; 1;
