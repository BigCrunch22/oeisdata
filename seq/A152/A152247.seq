%C A152247 From _Matthew Vandermast_, Nov 21 2009: (Start)
%C A152247 Odd analog of the EKG sequence. Cf. A064413.
%C A152247 In contrast to A064413, there are at least 2 different patterns by which primes > a(2) are introduced into the sequence. 5 is the first of many primes p that are immediately preceded in the sequence by 3p and immediately followed by 5p. For p = 7, 19, or 31, p is immediately preceded by 5p and immediately followed by 3p. (End)
%C A152247 In fact, based on the first 10000 terms, it appears that apart from the three exceptions 7, 19, and 31, primes p are always preceded by 3*p and followed by 5*p. The graph is very similar to the graph of the EKG sequence. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Oct 29 2020
