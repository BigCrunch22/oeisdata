%N A152138 a(n) is the smallest N such that the {n,n+1}-leaper graph with 2n+1 rows and N columns has a Hamiltonian cycle.
%C A152138 An {r,s}-leaper graph is a chessboard-like graph, with two vertices adjacent when an {r,s}-leaper can leap from one to the other. When r=1 and s=2 we have an ordinary knight's move; in general, an {r,s}-leaper goes from (x,y) to (x +- r, y +- s) or to (x +- s, y +- r). The theory of these graphs is developed in the paper ``Leaper Graphs'', which discusses the values of a(1) through a(7) and gives a quadratic lower bound.
%C A152138 This problem turns out to be an excellent benchmark for the special case of TSP solvers where the intercity distances are just 0 and infinity.
%C A152138 The values of a(2) and a(3) are due to George Jelliss; I found a(4) and a(5); and Michael Juenger found a(6) and a(7).
%C A152138 Michael Juenger has found that A152138(10)=212 and A152138(11)=254. As noted earlier, this means that he should be credited for establishing the values of a(6) thru a(11) in this sequence. (Added Jun 24 2010)

%e A152138 We have a(1)=10 because a 3 X 10 chessboard was shown to be Hamiltonian by Bergholt in 1918, while there clearly are no Hamiltonian cycles on a 3 X 8 or 3 X 6 or 3 X 4 or 3 X 2 or 3 X odd.
