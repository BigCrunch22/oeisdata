%N A152127 Sum of cousin primes < 10^n.
%C A152127 "According to the first Hardy-Littlewood conjecture, the cousin primes have the same asymptotic density as the twin primes." See link MathWorld. The (sum of cousin prime pairs < 10^n)/4 ~ number of cousin primes < 10^2n.

%F A152127 Cousin primes are prime pairs that differ by 4. The convention here is to count a cousin pair as long as the first cousin of the pair is less than or equal to the specified bound which in this sequence is 10^n.
%e A152127 (3,7) and (7,11) are the cousin primes < 10. These add up to 28 the first entry in the sequence.
