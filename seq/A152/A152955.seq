%N A152955 Odd squarefree numbers n such that the cyclotomic polynomial Phi(n,x) has height 1.
%C A152955 The height of a polynomial is the maximum of the absolute value of its coefficients. Polynomials of height 1 are also called flat polynomials. This sequence includes prime (first order) and semiprime (second order) n, as well as third-order (A117223), fourth-order (A117318) and higher-order n.
