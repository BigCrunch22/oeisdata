%N A152524 a(n) is the number of L-bit words in which, if up to k bits are perturbed, the resulting change in unsigned L-bit value is n, for L=8 and k=7.
%F A152524 a(n) = 511 + (-1)^n - 2*n.
%F A152524 G.f.: -4*(-127 + 128*n^2)/((n+1)*(n-1)^2).
%e A152524 For n=5, a(5) = 500, i.e., there are 500 possible L-bit words in which up to k bits can be perturbed, leading to a change in the word's unsigned value by 5, for L=8 and k=7.
%e A152524 For n=254, a(254) = 4, for L=8 and k=7.
%e A152524 For n=255, a(255) = 0, i.e., there is no L-bit word in which up to k bit positions can be perturbed to lead to a change in the unsigned value of the word by 255, for L=8 and k=7.
