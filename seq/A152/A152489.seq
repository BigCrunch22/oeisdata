%N A152489 Finite rectangular array (24x4) used in A152490.
%C A152489 Indexing sequence used to shift the columns in A051731 like the changing symbols in a slot machine. There is one possible position for the first column, two for the second column, three for the third column and so on. Hence the length of this array is factorial(4)=24. The determinant of A051731 whose fourth column has been shifted 3 steps upwards, by using the fourth row from this array (0,0,0,3), is the fourth value of the mobius function.
