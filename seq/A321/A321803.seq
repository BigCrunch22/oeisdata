%N A321803 Keep only consecutive identical decimal digits of n; write 0 if all digits disappear.
%C A321803 Consecutive identical digits of n are kept. Leading zeros are erased unless the result is 0. If all digits are erased, we write 0 for the result (A321804 is another version, which uses -1 for the empty string).
%C A321803 More than the usual number of terms are shown in order to reach some interesting examples. Agrees with A321797 for n < 121.
%C A321803 Differs from A321538 for the first time at n = 11011. - _Chai Wah Wu_, Nov 29 2018
%e A321803 123321 becomes 33, 1123 becomes 11, 112331 becomes 1133, and 100223 becomes 22 (as we don't accept leading zeros). Note that 12321 disappears immediately and we get 0.
