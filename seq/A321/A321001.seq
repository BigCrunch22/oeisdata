%N A321001 Primes which contain the fax number of the beast (667).
%C A321001 Since the so-called beastly primes (containing the digit string 666) were mentioned recently in a Numberphile video (see link), I guess it is now OK to include these numbers (which are based on the old convention that your fax number was one more than your telephone number) in the OEIS.
%C A321001 Note that there is no analog of A232448, because 1 0^k 667 0^k 1 is always divisible by 3 and is never prime.
