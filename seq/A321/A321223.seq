%N A321223 a(n) is the number of recursively self-conjugate partitions of n.
%C A321223 A recursively self-conjugate partition L has a conjugate L* = L. Further, elimination of the Durfee square and leg (conjugate with the arm) to leave the arm L_1. L_1 likewise has conjugate L_1* = L_1. We continue taking the arm, eliminating the new Durfee square and leg in this manner until the entire partition is processed and all arms are self-conjugate.
%C A321223 We can define a recursively self-conjugate partition L by placing a series S of squares s_k in position k, whose side-lengths decrease as k increases, in the following manner. We place the first square in the upper left corner, then set 2^(k - 1) squares s_k in all places wherein we have bounds by axis or previous square to the left and top. Thereby we can abbreviate all recursively self-conjugate partitions L by S(L). For example, (5,4,4,4,1) = {4,1}, and (10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1) = {5,3,1,1}. (See Keith 2011 page 9 Fig. 3.)
%C A321223 A190900 = positions of 0 in a(n).
%C A321223 Observation: the graph of this sequence separates into two distinct bands for n greater than approximately 10,000. Values of a(n) for n mod 3 = 0 or 1 tend to be greater than a(n) for n mod 3 = 2. Even within the upper band, we have the mean a(n) for n mod 3 = 0 distinct from the mean a(n) for n mod 3 = 1.

%e A321223 a(2) = 0 since neither (2) nor (1,1) is recursively symmetrical.
%e A321223 a(6) = 1 since the partition (3,2,1) of 6 is recursively symmetrical. S(3,2,1) = {2,1}.
%e A321223 a(27) = 2 since both (6,6,6,3,3,3) and (6,5,5,5,5,1) are recursively self-conjugate. S(6,6,6,3,3,3) = {3,3}; S(6,5,5,5,5,1) = {5,1}.
%e A321223 a(103) = 3 since there are 3 recursively self-conjugate partitions of 103: (13,13,13,10,10,10,7,6,6,6,3,3,3), (13,12,12,12,12,8,7,6,5,5,5,5,1), and (13,12,12,10,9,9,9,9,9,4,3,3,1). These can be stated in terms of recursive squares as {7,3,3}, {7,5,1}, and {9,3,1} respectively.
