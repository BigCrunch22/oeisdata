%N A321909 a(n) is the least base b > 1 in which the additive persistence of n is <= 1.
%C A321909 Equivalently, a(n) is the least base b > 1 in which the sum of digits of n is < b.
%C A321909 The sequence is well defined as, for any n > 0, the additive persistence of n is 0 in base n + 1.
%C A321909 This sequence is unbounded.

%e A321909 - in base 2, 42 has additive persistence 3: "101010" -> "11" -> "10" -> "1",
