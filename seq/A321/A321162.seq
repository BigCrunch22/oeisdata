%N A321162 Maximum number of unbordered conjugates for a binary word of length n.
%C A321162 Two words are conjugate if one is a cyclic shift of the other, such as "enlist" and "listen".  A word w is bordered if it has a nonempty prefix that is also a suffix (and not equal to w), such as the word "entanglement".   Harju and Nowotka show that for length-n binary words, at most n/2 unbordered conjugates are possible.

%e A321162 For n = 10, the word 0000101101 has 10 distinct conjugates, but only 4 of them are unbordered: {0000101101, 1011010000, 1101000010, 0100001011}.  This is maximum for n = 10.
