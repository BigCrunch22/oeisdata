%N A321411 Number of non-isomorphic self-dual multiset partitions of weight n with no singletons, with aperiodic parts whose sizes are relatively prime.
%C A321411 A multiset is aperiodic if its multiplicities are relatively prime.
%C A321411 Also the number of nonnegative integer symmetric matrices up to row and column permutations with sum of elements equal to n and no zero rows or columns, with relatively prime row sums (or column sums) and no row or column having a common divisor > 1 or summing to 1.
%C A321411 The dual of a multiset partition has, for each vertex, one part consisting of the indices (or positions) of the parts containing that vertex, counted with multiplicity. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,2}} is {{1},{1,2,2}}.
%C A321411 The weight of a multiset partition is the sum of sizes of its parts. Weight is generally not the same as number of vertices.
%e A321411 Non-isomorphic representatives of the a(5) = 1 through a(9) = 16 multiset partitions:
