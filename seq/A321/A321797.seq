%N A321797 Delete the decimal digits of n that appear exactly once; write 0 if all digits disappear.
%C A321797 A companion sequence to A320486.
%C A321797 Digits that appear exactly once in n are erased. Leading zeros are erased unless the result is 0. If all digits are erased, we write 0 for the result (A321800 is another version, which uses -1 for the empty string).
%C A321797 More than the usual number of terms are shown in order to reach some interesting examples.

%e A321797 12321 becomes 1221, 1123 becomes 11, 11231 becomes 111, and 100223 becomes 22 (as we don't accept leading zeros). Note that 12345 disappears immediately and we get 0.
