%N A321612 Numbers k such that all k - t are triangular numbers where t is a triangular number in range k/2 <= t < k.
%C A321612 The following is a quotation from Hage-Hassan in his paper (see Link below). "The (concept of) right and left symmetry is fundamental in physics. This incites us to ask whether this symmetry is in (the) primes. Find the numbers n with a + a' = n. a, a' are primes and {a} are all the primes with: n/2 <= a < n and n = 2,3, ..."
%C A321612 This sequence is analogous to A320447. Instead of the sequence of primes it uses the sequence of triangular numbers (A000217). It is conjectured that the sequence is finite and full.

%e A321612 a(9) = 31, because the triangular numbers in the range 16 <= p < 31 are {21}. Also the complementary set {10} has all its members triangular numbers. This is the 9th occurrence of such a number.
