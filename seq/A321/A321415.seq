%N A321415 Number of n element multisets of the 2n-th roots of unity with zero sum.
%C A321415 Equivalently, the number of closed convex paths of length n whose steps are the 2n-th roots of unity up to translation. For even n, there will be n paths of zero area consisting of n/2 steps in one direction followed by n/2 steps in the opposite direction.
%C A321415 Compared with A262181, this sequence counts all rotations distinctly and also for even n includes n/2 flat polygons as described above.
%C A321415 For prime n, a(n) is always 2. For odd prime the two solutions are the one consisting of all n-th roots of unity and the other consisting of their negated values.
%F A321415 a(p) = 2 for prime p.
%e A321415 a(4) = 12 because there are 3 basic shapes illustrated below which with rotations of multiples of 45 degrees give 4 + 2 + 4 = 10 distinct convex paths.
