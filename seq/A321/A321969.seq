%N A321969 Distinct weight enumerators for binary self-dual codes of length 2n.
%C A321969 All binary self-dual codes must have even length.  This is due to the fact that all binary self-dual codes contain the "all 1's codeword".  If a binary self-dual code could have odd length, the dot product of the "all 1's codeword" with itself would be equal to 1. A dot product of 1 would imply it is not orthogonal to itself and so the code could not be self-dual.

%e A321969 For n=1 there is only a(1) = 1 distinct weight enumerator for the length 2 binary self-dual codes. Up to permutation equivalence there is only 1 length 2 binary self-dual code.
%e A321969 For n=18 there are a(18)=3504 distinct weight enumerators.  There are 519492 binary self-dual codes of length 36. However there are only 3504 distinct weight enumerators among the 519492 binary self-dual codes.
