%N A321531 a(n) is the maximum number of distinct directions between n non-attacking rooks on an n X n chessboard.
%C A321531 Directions are determined up to scaling and dihedral action of the square, as in (m,k)-riders. For example, the moves (1,2) and (2,-4) are considered to have the same direction.
%e A321531 For n = 5, a 5 X 5 board with a(5) = 6 distinct directions is
