%N A321413 Number of non-isomorphic self-dual multiset partitions of weight n with no singletons and relatively prime part sizes.
%C A321413 Also the number of nonnegative integer symmetric matrices up to row and column permutations with sum of elements equal to n and no zero rows or columns, with relatively prime row sums (or column sums) and no row (or column) summing to 1.
%C A321413 The dual of a multiset partition has, for each vertex, one part consisting of the indices (or positions) of the parts containing that vertex, counted with multiplicity. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,2}} is {{1},{1,2,2}}.
%C A321413 The weight of a multiset partition is the sum of sizes of its parts. Weight is generally not the same as number of vertices.
%e A321413 Non-isomorphic representatives of the a(5) = 3, a(7) = 14, and a(8) = 13 multiset partitions:
