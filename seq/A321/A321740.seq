%N A321740 Number of representations of n as a truncated triangular number.
%C A321740 A truncated triangular number is a figurate number, the number of dots in a hexagonal diagram where the side lengths alternate between two values. This sequence gives the number of ways that a number can be represented in this form.
%C A321740 In a sense this sequence is a hexagonal analog of A038548, which asks the same question for rectangular numbers, and A001227 for trapezoidal numbers.
%C A321740 These sequences usually turn out to count divisors of a particular form, of a number simply related to n, but such a formulation is not yet known in this case.
%C A321740 Indices for which this sequence is nonzero are at A008912; this sequence is 2 or greater at the indices given in A319602.
%e A321740 a(36) = 2 because 36 can be achieved with hexagons of sides (1,9,1,9,1,9) and (3,5,3,5,3,5).
%Y A321740 Cf. A008912, A008867, A319602, A322491, A322492.
