%N A321252 (Conjecturally) the lexicographically earliest infinite sequence over {0,1,2,3} avoiding abelian squares.
%C A321252 An abelian square is a nonempty string where the second half is a rearrangement of the first half, like the English word "reappear". To "avoid" an abelian square means to have no contiguous block of that form. Although an easy compactness argument, combined with a result of Keränen (1992) shows that the lexicographically earliest infinite string avoiding abelian squares over the alphabet {0,1,2,3} must exist, the terms provided are only conjecturally part of the described sequence, because we have no proof currently that this particular string can be extended infinitely far to the right.
