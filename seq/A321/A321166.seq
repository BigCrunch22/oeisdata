%N A321166 Maximum number of overlap-free conjugates of a length-n binary word.
%C A321166 Two words are conjugates if one is a cyclic shift of the other. A word is overlap-free if it contains no block of the form axaxa, where a is a single letter and x is a (possibly empty) block.

%e A321166 The word w = 01001011010 has 4 overlap-free conjugates:  namely, w itself and {10010110100, 00101101001, 01011010010}. This is maximal for n = 11.
