%N A321945 Number of binary self-dual codes of length 2n having an automorphism group size that is a prime power.
%C A321945 Codes are vector spaces with a metric defined on them.  Specifically, the metric is the hamming distance between two vectors.  Vectors of a code are called codewords.
%C A321945 A code is usually represented by a generating matrix.  The row space of the generating matrix is the code itself.
%C A321945 Self-dual codes are codes such all codewords are pairwise orthogonal to each other.
%C A321945 Two codes are called permutation equivalent if one code can be obtained by permuting the coordinates (columns) of the other code.
%C A321945 The automorphism group of a code is the set of permutations of the coordinates (columns) that result in the same identical code.
%C A321945 There are codes with a trivial automorphism group of size 1.  This sequence does not count those codes.
