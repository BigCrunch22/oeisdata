%N A321334 n such that all n - s are squarefree numbers where s is a squarefree number in range n/2 <= s < n.
%C A321334 The following is a quotation from Hage-Hassan in his paper (see Link below). "The (concept of) right and left symmetry is fundamental in physics. This incites us to ask whether this symmetry is in (the) primes. Find the numbers n with a + a' = n. a, a' are primes and {a} are all the primes with: n/2 <= a < n and n = 2,3, ..."
%C A321334 This sequence is analogous to A320447. Instead of the sequence of primes it uses the sequence of squarefree numbers (A005117). It is conjectured that the sequence is finite and full.

%e A321334 a(10)=16, because the squarefree numbers s in the range 8 <= s < 16 are {10, 11, 13, 14, 15}. Also the complementary set {6, 5, 3, 2, 1} has all its members practical numbers. This is the 10th occurrence of such a number.
