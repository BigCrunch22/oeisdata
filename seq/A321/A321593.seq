%N A321593 Smallest number of vertices supporting a graph with exactly n Hamiltonian paths.
%C A321593 The reverse of a path is counted as the same path. a(n) is well-defined as the cycle graph C_n has n paths.
%C A321593 a(n) >= A249905(n) - 1, since the number of Hamiltonian paths in G is the same as the number of Hamiltonian cycles in H, where H is G with a new vertex connected to all vertices in G.

%e A321593 a(12) = 4 since K_4 has 12 Hamiltonian paths, and no graph on less than 4 vertices has 12 Hamiltonian paths.
%Y A321593 The corresponding sequence for Hamiltonian cycles is A249905.
