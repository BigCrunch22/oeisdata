%N A278237 a(n) = A046523(A263273(n)).
%C A278237 This sequence works as a "sentinel" for A263273 by matching to any sequence that is obtained as f(A263273(n)), where f(n) is any function that depends only on the prime signature of n (see the index entry for "sequences computed from exponents in ..."). As of Nov 11 2016 no such sequences were present in the database, although a prefix of A050361 at first seemed to match. Note that A050361 really matches with A046523.
