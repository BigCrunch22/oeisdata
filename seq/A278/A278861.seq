%N A278861 Start with a(1)=0; thereafter, between two successive digits "3" there are 0, then 1, then 2, then 3, ... other digits.
%C A278861 The sequence starts with a(1) = 0 and is always extended with the smallest integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction.

%e A278861 There are 0 digit between "3" and "30"; there is 1 digit between the "3" of "30" and the "3" of "31" (this is the "0" of "30"); there are 2 digits between the "3" of "31" and the "3" of "32" (they are the "1" of "31" and "4" of "4"); there are 3 digits between the "3" of "32" and the "3" of "34" (they are the "2" of "32", the "5" of "5" and the "6" of "6"); etc.
