%N A278234 Filter-sequence for factorial base (digit slopes): Least number with the same prime signature as A275734(n).
%C A278234 This sequence can be used for filtering certain factorial base (A007623) related sequences, because it matches only with any such sequence b that can be computed as b(n) = f(A275734(n)), where f(n) is any function that depends only on the prime signature of n (some of these are listed under the index entry for "sequences computed from exponents in ...").
%C A278234 Matching in this context means that the sequence a matches with the sequence b iff for all i, j: a(i) = a(j) => b(i) = b(j). In other words, iff the sequence b partitions the natural numbers to the same or coarser equivalence classes (as/than the sequence a) by the distinct values it obtains.
