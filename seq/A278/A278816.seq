%N A278816 Numbers that can be produced from their own digits by applying one or more of the eight operations {+, -, *, /, sqrt(), ^, !, concat11()}, with no operation used more than once, where "concat11()" means the operation of concatenating two single digits.
%C A278816 Extending the sequence will soon become impractical without a program to check every possible way to apply one or more of the eight operations. - Editors, Dec 03 2016
