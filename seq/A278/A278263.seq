%N A278263 Least number with the same prime signature as the n-th term of EKG-sequence: a(n) = A046523(A064413(n)).
%C A278263 This sequence works as a "sentinel" for EKG-sequence by matching to any sequence that is obtained as f(A064413(n)), where f(n) is any function that depends only on the prime signature of n (see the index entry for "sequences computed from exponents in ..."). The last line in Crossrefs section lists such sequences that were present in the database as of Nov 11 2016.
%C A278263 Terms and b-file computed from b-file of A064413 provided by _Zak Seidov_.
