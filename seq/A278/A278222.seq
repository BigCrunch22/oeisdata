%N A278222 The least number with the same prime signature as A005940(n+1).
%C A278222 This sequence can be used for filtering certain base-2 related sequences, because it matches only with any such sequence b that can be computed as b(n) = f(A005940(n+1)), where f(n) is any function that depends only on the prime signature of n (some of these are listed under the index entry for "sequences computed from exponents in ...").
%C A278222 Matching in this context means that the sequence a matches with the sequence b iff for all i, j: a(i) = a(j) => b(i) = b(j). In other words, iff the sequence b partitions the natural numbers to the same or coarser equivalence classes (as/than the sequence a) by the distinct values it obtains.
%C A278222 Because the Doudna map n -> A005940(1+n) is an isomorphism from "unary-binary encoding of factorization" (see A156552) to the ordinary representation of the prime factorization of n, it follows that the equivalence classes of this sequence match with any such sequence b, where b(n) is computed from the lengths of 1-runs in the binary representation of n and the order of those 1-runs does not matter. Particularly, this holds for any sequence that is obtained as a "Run Length Transform", i.e., where b(n) = Product S(i), for some function S, where i runs through the lengths of runs of 1's in the binary expansion of n. See for example A227349.
%C A278222 However, this sequence itself is not a run length transform of any sequence (which can be seen for example from the fact that A046523 is not multiplicative).
%C A278222 Furthermore, this matches not only with sequences involving products of S(i), but with any sequence obtained with any commutative function applied cumulatively, like e.g., A000120 (binary weight, obtained in this case as Sum identity(i)), and A069010 (number of runs of 1's in binary representation of n, obtained as Sum signum(i)).
