%N A278236 Filter-sequence for factorial base (digit values): least number with the same prime signature as A276076(n).
%C A278236 This sequence can be used for filtering certain factorial base related sequences, because it matches only with any such sequence b that can be computed as b(n) = f(A276076(n)), where f(n) is any function that depends only on the prime signature of n (some of these are listed under the index entry for "sequences computed from exponents in ...").
%C A278236 Matching in this context means that the sequence a matches with the sequence b iff for all i, j: a(i) = a(j) => b(i) = b(j). In other words, iff the sequence b partitions the natural numbers to the same or coarser equivalence classes (as/than the sequence a) by the distinct values it obtains.
%C A278236 Any such sequence should match where the result is computed from the nonzero digits (that may also be > 9) in the factorial base representation of n, but does not depend on their order. Some of these are listed on the last line of the Crossrefs section.
%C A278236 Note that as A275735 is present in that list it means that the sequences matching to its filter-sequence A278235 form a subset of the sequences matching to this sequence. Also, for A275735 there is a stronger condition that for any i, j: a(i) = a(j) <=> A275735(i) = A275735(j), which if true, would imply that there is an injective function f such that f(A275735(n)) = A278236(n), and indeed, this function seems to be A181821.
