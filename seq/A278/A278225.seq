%N A278225 Filter-sequence for factorial base (cycles in A060117/A060118-permutations): Least number with the same prime signature as A275725.
%C A278225 This sequence can be used for filtering certain sequences related to cycle-structures in finite permutations as ordered by lists A060117 / A060118 (and thus also related to factorial base representation, A007623) because it matches only with any such sequence b that can be computed as b(n) = f(A275725(n)), where f(n) is any function that depends only on the prime signature of n (some of these are listed under the index entry for "sequences computed from exponents in ...").
%C A278225 Matching in this context means that the sequence a matches with the sequence b iff for all i, j: a(i) = a(j) => b(i) = b(j). In other words, iff the sequence b partitions the natural numbers to the same or coarser equivalence classes (as/than the sequence a) by the distinct values it obtains.
