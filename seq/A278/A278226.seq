%N A278226 Filter-sequence for primorial base: least number with the same prime signature as A276086(n).
%C A278226 This sequence can be used for filtering certain primorial base related sequences, because it matches only with any such sequence b that can be computed as b(n) = f(A276086(n)), where f(n) is any function that depends only on the prime signature of n (some of these are listed under the index entry for "sequences computed from exponents in ...").
%C A278226 Matching in this context means that the sequence a matches with the sequence b iff for all i, j: a(i) = a(j) => b(i) = b(j). In other words, iff the sequence b partitions the natural numbers to the same or coarser equivalence classes (as/than the sequence a) by the distinct values it obtains.
%C A278226 Any such sequence should match where the result is computed from the nonzero digits (that may also be > 9) in the primorial base representation of n, but does not depend on their order. Some of these are listed on the last line of the Crossrefs section.
