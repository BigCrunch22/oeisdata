%N A278791 Number of complex cubic fields with discriminant >= -10^n.
%C A278791 Belabas invented an algorithm to identify all cubic fields with a discriminant bounded by X in essentially linear time, and computed the above values up to a(11).
%C A278791 The number of complex cubic fields with discriminant >= -X is asymptotic to X/(4*zeta(3)) = (0.207976...)*X. The second order term was conjectured by Roberts to be a known constant times X^{5/6}, and this was subsequently proved by Bhargava et al.
