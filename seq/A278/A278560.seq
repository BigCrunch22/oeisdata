%N A278560 Numbers of the form x^2 + y^2 + z^2 with x + 3*y + 5*z a square, where x, y and z are nonnegative integers.
%C A278560 This is motivated by the author's 1-3-5-Conjecture which states that any nonnegative integer can be expressed as the sum of a square and a term of the current sequence.
%C A278560 Clearly, any term times a fourth power is also a term of this sequence. By the Gauss-Legendre theorem on sums of three squares, no term has the form 4^k*(8m+7) with k and m nonnegative integers.

%e A278560 a(4) = 3 since 3 = 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 with 1 + 3*1 + 5*1 = 3^2.
%e A278560 a(5) = 8 since 8 = 0^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 with 0 + 3*2 + 5*2 = 4^2.
