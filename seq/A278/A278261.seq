%N A278261 a(n) = A046523(A273671(n)).
%C A278261 This sequence works as a "sentinel" for A273671 by matching to any sequence that is obtained as f(A273671(n)), where f(n) is any function that depends only on the prime signature of n (see the index entry for "sequences computed from exponents in ..."). The only other sequence that as of Nov 11 2016 seems to match is A106347, although more terms of the latter would be needed to better ascertain whether the connection is spurious or genuine.
