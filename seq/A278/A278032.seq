%N A278032 a(n) is the smallest positive integer not already in the sequence such that Sum_{i=1..n} binary_weight(a(i)) is prime.
%C A278032 A binary analog of A269415.
%C A278032 Clearly 1 is the only term of odd weight that can appear, and if it is true (which is not presently known) that there infinitely many prime gaps of 2, 4, 6, 8, etc. then every number of even weight will appear.
