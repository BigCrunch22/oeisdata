%N A278986 Array read by antidiagonals downwards: T(b,n) = number of words of length n over an alphabet of size b that are in standard order and which have the property that at least one letter is repeated.
%C A278986 We study words made of letters from an alphabet of size b, where b >= 1. We assume the letters are labeled {1,2,3,...,b}. There are b^n possible words of length n.
%C A278986 We say that a word is in "standard order" if it has the property that whenever a letter i appears, the letter i-1 has already appeared in the word.  This implies that all words begin with the letter 1.

%F A278986 The number of words of length n over an alphabet of size b that are in standard order and in which at least one symbol is repeated is Sum_{j = 1..b} Stirling2(n,j), except we must subtract 1 if and only if n <= b.
%F A278986 So this array is obtained from the array in A278984 by subtracting 1 from the first b entries in row b, for b = 1,2,3,...
