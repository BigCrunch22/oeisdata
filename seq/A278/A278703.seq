%N A278703 Divide a full period sine wave into n equally spaced points along the x-axis, labeled 1 through n, from left to right. Rank the points according to their sine value and read by rows.
%C A278703 Inspired by A276669.
%C A278703 Two other sequences in the same vein could be constructed, one with points from 0 to n-1 and the other with points from 0 to n. The latter would only insert a zero before n.
%C A278703 Column 1 appears to be A037915 and the last column appears to be A002265.

%e A278703 Row 3: The first point is (Pi/2, 1), the second point is (Pi,0) and the third point is (3*Pi/2, -1). Sorting by the Y value and reading the points by their index, we have 3, 2, 1.
%e A278703 Row 4: The first point is at (2*Pi/5, sqrt(5/8 + sqrt(5)/8)), point two is at (4*Pi/5, sqrt(5/8 - sqrt(5)/8)), point three is at (6*Pi/5, -sqrt(5/8 - sqrt(5)/8)) and point four is at (8*Pi/5, -sqrt(5/8 + sqrt(5)/8)). Sorting the point labels by their Y values in increasing order, we have 4, 3, 2, 1.
