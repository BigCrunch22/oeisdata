%N A278619 Hexagonal spiral constructed on the nodes of the triangular net in which each new term is the sum of its two largest neighbors in the structure.
%C A278619 To evaluate a(n) consider only the two largest neighbors of a(n) that are present in the spiral when a(n) should be a new term in the spiral.
%C A278619 For the same idea but for an right triangle see A278645; for a square spiral see A278180.
%C A278619 It appears that the same idea for an isosceles triangle and also for a square array gives A030237.

%e A278619 a(16) = 36 because the sum of its two largest neighbors is 31 + 5 = 36.
%e A278619 a(17) = 42 because the sum of its two largest neighbors is 36 + 6 = 42.
%e A278619 a(18) = 49 because the sum of its two largest neighbors is 42 + 7 = 49.
%e A278619 a(19) = 56 because the sum of its two largest neighbors is 49 + 7 = 56.
