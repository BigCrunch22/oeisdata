%N A278825 Bishop's moves in chess: possible difference between origin and destination square when the squares are numbered sequentially, row by row.
%C A278825 Let the squares of a standard (8 X 8) chessboard be numbered sequentially from 1 to 64, row by row (e.g., a1 = 1, b1 = 2, ..., a2 = 9, ..., h8 = 64). Let X be the number of a square a bishop stands on, and Y the number of a square to which it can move. Then this sequence lists all possible values of Y-X.
%C A278825 The terms are to some extent independent of the precise numbering scheme. For example, one could also use number = row + 8 * column, where row and column range from 1 to 8 (thus the numbers from 9 to 72), or from 0 to 7 (with squares numbered from 0 to 63). However, the board must be numbered such that moving up or down or left or right one square will always yield a difference of +- 8 or +- 1. (All directions mentioned here correspond to a standard vertical diagram with White starting at the bottom and Black starting on the top.)
%e A278825 If a bishop moves two squares to the upper left, e.g., from c1 to a3, this yields a difference Y - X = 2*(-1+8) = 14.
