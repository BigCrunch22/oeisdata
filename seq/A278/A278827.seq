%N A278827 Queen's moves in chess: possible difference between origin and destination square when the squares are numbered sequentially, row by row.
%C A278827 Let the squares of a standard (8 X 8) chessboard be numbered sequentially from 1 to 64, row by row (e.g., a1 = 1, b1 = 2, ..., a2 = 9, ..., h8 = 64). Let X be the number of a square a queen stands on, and Y the number of a square to which it can move. Then this sequence lists all possible values of Y-X.
%C A278827 The terms are to some extent independent of the precise numbering scheme. For example, one could also use number = row + 8 * column, where row and column range from 1 to 8 (thus the numbers from 9 to 72), or from 0 to 7 (with squares numbered from 0 to 63). However, the board must be numbered such that moving up or down or left or right one square will always yield a difference of +- 8 or +- 1. (All directions mentioned here correspond to a standard vertical diagram with White starting at the bottom and Black starting on the top.)
%F A278827 Equal to A278825 union A278826 (Bishop's and Rook's moves).
%e A278827 If a queen moves two squares to the left, e.g., from h8 to f8, this yields a difference Y - X = -2.
%e A278827 If a queen moves three squares up, e.g., from h1 to h4, this yields a difference Y - X = 3*8 = 24.
