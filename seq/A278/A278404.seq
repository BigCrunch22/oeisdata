%N A278404 Greater number in the least prime-semiprime gap of size n.
%C A278404 A prime-semiprime gap of n is defined as the difference between p & q, p being either a prime, A000040, or a semiprime, A001358, and q being the next greater prime or semiprime, see examples.
%C A278404 The corresponding numbers at the start of the prime-semiprime gaps, i.e., a(n)-n, are in A278351.

%e A278404 a(1) = 3 since there is a gap of 1 between 2 and 3, both of which are primes.
%e A278404 a(2) = 9 since there is a gap of 2 between 7 and 9, the first is a prime and the second is a semiprime.
%e A278404 a(3) = 29 since there is a gap of 3 between 26, a semiprime, and 29, a prime.
%e A278404 a(6) = 247 because the first prime-semiprime gap of size 6 is between 241 and 247.
%Y A278404 Cf. A037143, A275013, A275014, A275108, A278351.
