%N A278007 Lexicographically first sequence of primes (with no duplicates) whose absolute first differences are nonprime (with no duplicates).
%C A278007 The sequence starts with a(1) = 2 and is always extended with the smallest integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction.
%C A278007 The equivalent sequence where nonprimes and primes exchange their roles is A277997.

%e A278007 After a(1) = 2, we cannot have a(2) = 1 as 1 is not a prime number; a(2) = 3 is OK as the absolute difference |2-3| = 1 is a nonprime; the next term a(3) cannot be 5 as the absolute difference |3-5| = 2 is a prime (and we don't want primes in the absolute differences); a(3) = 7 is OK as the absolute difference |3-7| = 4 is a nonprime not yet present in the absolute differences; the next term a(4) cannot be 5 as the absolute difference |7-5| = 2 is a prime; the next term a(4) cannot be 11 as the absolute difference |7-11| = 4 is already in the absolute differences, a(4) = 13 is OK as the absolute difference |7-13| = 6 is a nonprime not yet present in the absolute differences; the next term a(5) is now 5 as |13-5| = 8 is a nonprime not yet present in the absolute differences; the next term a(6) cannot be 11, the smallest available prime, as the absolute difference |5-11| = 6 is a nonprime already present in the absolute differences; a(6) = 17 is OK as |5-17| = 12 is a nonprime not yet present in the absolute differences; the next term a(7) cannot be 11, 19, 23 or 29 for one of the above reasons, but a(7) = 31 is OK as |17-31| = 14 is a nonprime not yet present in the absolute differences; etc.
