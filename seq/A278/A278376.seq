%N A278376 The cumulative sum of the first successive a(n) digits is always odd.
%C A278376 The sequence starts with a(1) = 1 and is always extended with the smallest positive integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction.
%C A278376 This is the lexicographically first sequence with this property.
%C A278376 Amazingly, after 2000 terms, the sequence is strictly increasing except on four occasions: ..., 6, 3, ... / ..., 20, 9, ... / ..., 27, 26, ... / ..., 83, 82, ...

%e A278376 a(1) = 1 and the cumulative sum of the 1st digit is indeed odd (1 = 1);
%e A278376 a(2) = 2 and the cumulative sum of the first 2 digits is odd, too (1+2 = 3);
%e A278376 a(3) cannot be 3 as the cumul. sum of the first 3 digits would be even (1+2+3 = 6);
%e A278376 a(3) = 4 works: the cumul. sum of the first 4 digits is odd (1+2+4+6 = 13);
%e A278376 a(4) cannot be 3 o 5 as those cumul. sums would be even (1+2+4+3 = 10) and (1+2+4+5 = 12);
%e A278376 a(4) = 6 works: the cumul. sum of the first 6 digits is odd (1+2+4+6+3+7 = 23);
%e A278376 a(5) = 3  as the cumul. sum of the first 3 digits is now odd (1+2+4 = 7);
%e A278376 ...
%e A278376 a(8) = 20 and the cumul. sum of the first 20 digits is odd (1+2+4+6+3+7+8+2+0+9+1+1+1+3+1+5+1+7+2+1 = 65);
%e A278376 a(9) = 9 and the cumul. sum of the first 9 digits is odd (1+2+4+6+3+7+8+2+0 = 33);
%e A278376 etc.
%Y A278376 Cf. A278437 (the "twin" sequence where "odd" is replaced by "even" in the definition).
