%N A278828 King's moves in chess: possible difference between origin and destination square when the squares are numbered sequentially row by row.
%C A278828 Let the squares of a standard (8 X 8) chessboard be numbered sequentially from 1 to 64, row by row (e.g., a1 = 1, b1 = 2, ..., a2 = 9, ..., h8 = 64). Let X be the number of a square a king stands on, and Y the number of a square to which it can move. Then this sequence lists all possible values of Y-X.
%C A278828 The terms are independent of the precise numbering scheme, provided that the numbers of the four possible neighbors of a square differ by +- 1 in one direction and +- 8 in the other direction. For example, one could also use number = row + 8 * column, where row and column range from 1 to 8, or from 0 to 7.
%e A278828 Moving one row up yields a difference Y - X = +8. Moving one square diagonally down and right yields a difference Y - X = +1 - 8 = -7.
%Y A278828 Cf. A278824 - A278827, A278829 (analog for Knights, ..., Queens and Pawns).
%Y A278828 This is a subsequence of A278827: Queen's moves.
