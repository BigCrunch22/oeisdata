%N A278209 a(n) is the smallest number k such that {p(1), p(2), ..., p(k)} contains each residue class mod n, where p(m) is the m-th partition number A000041(m).
%C A278209 It has been conjectured that for each r and n, there is some k such that p(k) = r mod n; on that conjecture, this sequence is defined for all n.
%C A278209 If congruence classes of p(m) were chosen uniformly at random, the expected value of this sequence would be ~ n log n.
