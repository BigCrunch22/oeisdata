%N A278248 Least number with the same prime signature as the n-th number in Perrin sequence: a(n) = A046523(A001608(n)), a(1) = 0.
%C A278248 This sequence works as a "sentinel" for Perrin sequence by matching to any other sequence that is obtained as f(A001608(n)), where f(n) is any function that depends only on the prime signature of n (see the index entry for "sequences computed from exponents in ..."). As of Nov 11 2016 no such sequences were present in the database.
