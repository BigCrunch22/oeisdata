%U A278967 16777217
%N A278967 Least number k which is (1) a multiple of the n-th prime and (2) of minimal Hamming weight.
%C A278967 Apart from the first term, all terms are odd.
%e A278967 2 = 2^1 has Hamming weight 1 and so a(1) = 2.
%e A278967 3 = 2^1 + 2^0 has Hamming weight 2, and any multiple of 3 has a Hamming weight at least as high, so a(2) = 3.
%e A278967 5 = 2^2 + 2^0 has Hamming weight 2 and so similarly a(3) = 5.
%e A278967 7 = 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 has Hamming weight 3, and all powers of 2 are 1, 2, or 4 mod 7, and so all multiples of 7 have Hamming weight at least 3, so a(4) = 7.
%e A278967 11 = 2^3 + 2^1 + 2^0 has Hamming weight 3 but 33 = 2^5 + 2^0 has Hamming weight 2 so a(5) = 33.
