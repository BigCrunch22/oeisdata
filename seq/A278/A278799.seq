%N A278799 Prime numbers that can be written as concatenation of two nonprimes in decimal representation.
%C A278799 This is not A066738 as we concatenate exactly two nonprimes here.
%C A278799 A121609 is the dual sequence where "prime" and "nonprime" are switched in the definition.

%e A278799 11 (prime) is the concatenation of "1" (nonprime) and "1" (nonprime); the next prime term cannot be 13 as "3" is a concatenated prime; the next prime term cannot be 17 as "7" is a concatenated prime; the next prime term is 19 as "1" and "9" are both nonprimes; the next prime term cannot be less than 41 because all terms < 41 and > 19 start with either a "2" or a "3", which are primes; etc.
