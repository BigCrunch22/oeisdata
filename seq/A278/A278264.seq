%N A278264 Least number with the same prime signature as the n-th term in the inverse of EKG-sequence: a(n) = A046523(A064664(n)).
%C A278264 This sequence works as a "sentinel" for the inverse of EKG-sequence by matching to any other sequence that is obtained as f(A064664(n)), where f(n) is any function that depends only on the prime signature of n (see the index entry for "sequences computed from exponents in ..."). As of Nov 11 2016 no such sequences were present in the database.
%C A278264 Terms and b-file computed from b-file of A064664 provided by _T. D. Noe_ and _Ray Chandler_.
