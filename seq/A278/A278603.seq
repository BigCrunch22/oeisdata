%N A278603 A prime mountain: peaks and valleys beyond the origin correspond to prime abscissa (see Comments for precise definition).
%C A278603 We start with a(0)=0 and a(1)=1, and then the sequence is extended according to these rules:
%C A278603 (1) |a(n+1) - a(n)| = 1 for any n>1,
%C A278603 (2) a(n+1) = a(n-1) iff n is prime.
%C A278603 Is this sequence ultimately positive or ultimately negative or will it change sign indefinitely?
%C A278603 From _Ryan Bresler_, Jan 04 2021: (Start)
%C A278603 This sequence will contain every integer on "at least one side" of the origin, i.e., it will not have a finite range.
%C A278603 Suppose this sequence has both a finite minimum, R1, and a finite maximum, R2. Since prime gaps become arbitrarily large, we will eventually reach a prime gap g, such that g > R2 - R1. We can see that this prime gap will cause at least one term of this sequence to be outside the interval [R1, R2]. This contradiction shows that all integers on at least one side of the origin will be terms of the sequence.

%e A278603 a(2) is either a(1) + 1 = 2 or a(1) - 1 = 0.
%e A278603 As 1 is not prime, a(2) = a(1+1) != a(1-1) = 0.
%e A278603 Hence, a(2) = 2.
%e A278603 As 2 is prime, a(3) = a(2+1) = a(2-1) = a(1) = 1.
%e A278603 As 3 is prime, a(4) = a(3+1) = a(3-1) = a(2) = 2.
%e A278603 a(5) is either a(4)+1 = 3 or a(4)-1 = 1.
%e A278603 As 4 is not prime, a(5) = a(4+1) != a(4-1) = 1.
%e A278603 Hence, a(5) = 3.
