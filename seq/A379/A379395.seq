%N A379395 Maximum number of fundamentally different graceful labelings for a simple graph of n nodes.
%C A379395 The difference between "fundamentally different graceful labelings" of a graph and "graceful labelings" of a graph is that the latter is the former multiplied by twice the number of automorphisms. (The extra factor of 2 comes from complementation.)
