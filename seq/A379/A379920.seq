%N A379920 a(n)=n for n<=3. for n>3 a(n) is the least novel squarefree number sharing a divisor with a(n-2) but not with a(n-1).
%C A379920 Squarefree version of the Yellowstone permutation A005117.
%C A379920 Conjectured to be a permutation of A005117, with primes in order.
%e A379920 Given a(2,3)=2,3 a(4)=10, the smallest novel squarefree number sharing a divisor(2) with a(2) and prime to a(3)=3. Likewise a(5()=21. Then a(6)=5, the smallest novel squarefree number sharing a divisor(5) with a(4)=10,and prime to a(5)=21.
