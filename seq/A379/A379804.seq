%N A379804 By definition, |A379803(k)| is twice a perfect square, say 2*b(k)^2. The values of b(k) appear to be the consecutive natural numbers 1, 2, 3, ... except that the numbers in the present sequence are omitted.
%C A379804 The sequence {b(k): k >= 1} begins 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20, ..., and as can be seen, 14, 15, and 18 are missing.
%C A379804 Conjecture: The values of b(k) are distinct. (This is true for the first 209 values.)
%Y A379804 Cf. A377091, A379066, A379788-A379794, A379802, A379803.
