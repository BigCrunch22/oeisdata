%N A379548 a(1) = 1. For n > 1, a(n) is the earliest novel squarefree number divisible by the smallest prime which does not divide a(n-1).
%C A379548 Squarefree version of A351495, conjectured to be a permutation of the squarefree numbers, A005117.
%e A379548 a(1)=1 implies a(2)=2, the smallest novel squarefree number divisible by 2, the least non divisor prime of 1. Likewise a(3)=3. a(4) must be the smallest squarefree multiple of 2, the least non divisor prime of 3, so a(4) cannot be 4, it must be 6 which is squarefree.
