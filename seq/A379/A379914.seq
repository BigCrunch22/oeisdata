%N A379914 Length of longest sequence over {0,1,...,n-1} containing no two consecutive blocks with the same average.
%C A379914 Sequence S = UABV does not satisfy the desired property if nonempty blocks A and B have the same average (where U, V, or both may be empty). For example, 4,1,3,5,0,6,2,9 does not have the desired property, because it can be written as (4)(1,3,5)(0,6)(2,9) and the two consecutive blocks (1,3,5) and (0,6) have the same average 3.
%C A379914 The Gerver-Ramsey theorem implies that for each n, such a sequence is of bounded length; see Theorem 2 in the paper of Brown.
