%N A379985 Numbers k such that k^2 is of the form b^2 + (4*c)^2 where b*c is squarefree.
%C A379985 It is known that the sum of squares of two odd numbers cannot be a square number, and when the sum of square of two numbers is the square of an odd number, the even one among the two numbers has to be multiple of 4. Thus the Mathematica program will not miss any entries.
%C A379985 a(n) == 1 (mod 4).
%C A379985 Numbers 4x^2 + y^2 where x, y are coprime odd numbers such that x, y, 2x+y, 2x-y are squarefree. - _Yifan Xie_, Jan 09 2025
%e A379985 5 is a term since 5^2 = 3^2 + (4*1)^2 and 3*1 is squarefree.
%e A379985 149 is a term since 149^2 = 51^2 + (4*35)^2 and 51*35 = 3*5*7*17 is squarefree.
