%N A379652 a(1) = 2. For n > 1, a(n) = smallest prime factor of c=2*a(n-1)+1 that is not in {a(1), ..., a(n-1)}; if all prime factors of c are in {a(1), ..., a(n-1)}, then we try the next value of c, which is 2*c+1; and so on.
%C A379652 The following are some statistics about how many terms of the sequence are required, so that the first k primes are included:
%C A379652 - The first 1,000 terms include the first 15 primes.
%C A379652 - The first 10,000 terms include the first 29 primes.
%C A379652 - The first 100,000 terms include the first 44 primes.
%C A379652 - The first 1,000,000 terms include the first 69 primes.
%C A379652 - The first 10,000,000 terms include the first 98 primes.
%C A379652 - The first 100,000,000 terms include the first 120 primes.
%C A379652 Conjecture: this sequence is a permutation of the primes.
%e A379652 a(6) is 19 because the prime factors of c=2*a(5)+1 (i.e., 95) are 5 and 19, and 5 already appears in the sequence as a(2).
%e A379652 a(9) is 31 because the prime factors of c=2*a(8)+1 (i.e., 15) are 3 and 5 which already appear in the sequence as a(7) and a(2). The next value of c (i.e., 2*c+1) is 31, which is prime and does not already appear in the sequence.
