%N A379750 First prime of cousin prime pairs which differ, in their binary representation, by a single bit.
%C A379750 The first prime of a cousin prime pair is a prime p for which p+4 is also prime.
%C A379750 The only way for p and p+4 to differ at a single bit position is when p has a 0 bit at its "4" position, so p == {0,1,2,3} (mod 8), and so this sequence is the intersection of A023200 and A047471.
%e A379750 3 is a term since it's a cousin prime with 7 and their respective binary representations 011 and 111 differ at a single bit position.
%e A379750 13 is not a term since, although it's a cousin prime with 17, their respective binary representations 1101 and 10001 differ at more than a single bit position.
