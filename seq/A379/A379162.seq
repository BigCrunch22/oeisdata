%N A379162 Ulam numbers that are sphenics.
%C A379162 Ulam numbers: a(1) = 1; a(2) = 2; for n>2, a(n) = least number > a(n-1) which is a unique sum of two distinct earlier terms.
%e A379162 102 is a term because 102=2*3*17 is the product of 3 distinct primes and 102 is an Ulam number.
%e A379162 114 is a term because 114=2*3*19 is the product of 3 distinct primes and 114 is an Ulam number.
%e A379162 273 is a term because 273=3*7*13 is the product of 3 distinct primes and 273 is an Ulam number.
