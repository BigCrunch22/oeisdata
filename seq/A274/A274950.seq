%N A274950 Trajectory of 0 under the morphism 0 -> 0001101, 1 -> 0011001.
%C A274950 In some bar codes, the 0's and 1's on the left represent digits according to the following code:
%C A274950 0 = 0001101,
%C A274950 1 = 0011001,
%C A274950 2 = 0010011,
%C A274950 ...,
%C A274950 9 = 0001011.
%C A274950 This sequence could then be loosely described as its own bar code.
%C A274950 (This assumes the sequence has no "guard digits" at the start, is infinite, and only uses the "left half" coding.)

%e A274950 Start with 0 -> 0001101, so we have 0001101. The second digit is 0, so we concatenate 0001101 which gives 00011010001101. The third digit is 0, so we concatenate 0001101 again which gives 000110100011010001101. The fourth digit is 1 so we concatenate 0011001 to get 0001101000110100011010011001, etc. - _David A.
