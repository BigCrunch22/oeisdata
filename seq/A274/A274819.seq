%N A274819 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = total number of regions in all arrangements of n circles in the affine plane forming k regions, excluding the regions that do not belong to the circles.
%C A274819 In other words: not counting the regions between circles.
%C A274819 Consider the arrangements of n circles described in A250001.
%F A274819 T(n,k) = k*A274777(n,k).
%e A274819 Triangle begins:
%e A274819 1;
%e A274819 0, 4,  3;
%e A274819 0, 0, 12, 16, 10, 6, 21;
%e A274819 0, 0,  0, ...
%e A274819 ...
%e A274819 For n = 3 and k = 5 there are 2 arrangements of 3 circles in the affine plane forming 5 regions, excluding the regions that do not belong to the circles, so T(3,5) = 2*5 = 10.
%e A274819 For n = 3 and k = 6 there is only one arrangement of 3 circles in the affine plane forming 6 regions, excluding the regions that do not belong to the circles, so T(3,6) = 1*6 = 6.
%e A274819 Of course, there is a right triangle of all zeros starting from the second row.
%Y A274819 Row sums give A274823(n).
%Y A274819 First differs from A274818 at a(10).
%Y A274819 Cf. A250001, A274777.
