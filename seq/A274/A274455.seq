%N A274455 Sequence (or tree) generated by these rules: 1 is in S, and if x is in S, then x -1 and 2*x are in S, and duplicates are deleted as they occur.
%C A274455 Every integer occurs exactly once.  The rules for this tree become identical to those for A232559 when "x + 1" is substituted for "x - 1".
%C A274455 For n > 3, the n-th generation has F(n) nodes, of which F(n-1) are positive and F(n-2) are negative, where F = A000045, the Fibonacci numbers.

%e A274455 Generation g(1) consists of the seed, 1; generation g(2) consists of 0 and 2 from which 0 begets -1 and 0, but this 0 is a duplicate and is removed, while 2 begets 1 and 4, with 1 removed, so that g(3) = {-1,4}.  Thereafter, g(4) = {-2,3,8}, g(5) = {-3,-4,6,7,16}, etc.
