%N A274021 Least positive x < n-1 such that x^y == -1 (mod n) for some y > 1, or 0 if no such x exist.
%C A274021 Indices of nonzero terms are listed in A126949 (in this sense the present sequence can be seen as characteristic function of A126949), indices of zeros (except for n=1) are given in A178751. Without the restriction x < n-1, one would have a(n) = n-1 instead of the zeros, since (n-1)^3 = (-1)^3 = -1 (mod n) for all n.
