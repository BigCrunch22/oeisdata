%N A274170 Christoffel words as binary numbers.
%C A274170 The Christoffel word of slope b/a is defined as follows:
%C A274170 Start at (0,0) in the 2-dimensional integer lattice and move up if possible, otherwise right, always keeping below or on the line y = b*x/a. Write down x for a horizontal move and y for a vertical move. The first move is necessarily horizontal, so the sequence always begins with x. Stop when you get to (a,b). The word then has length a+b and contains a copies of x and b of y (see Berstel et al., p. 6, Fig. 2). The symbols x and y are arbitrary: we replace x with 1 and y with 0 and treat the resulting word as a binary number. The sequence is in increasing order of decimal equivalents. The Christoffel word with least decimal equivalent is 10 with decimal equivalent 2.

%e A274170 The Christoffel word of slope 4/7 is xxyxxyxxyxy which becomes 11011011010 with decimal equivalent 1754.
