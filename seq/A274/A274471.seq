%N A274471 Numbers missing from A134419 despite satisfying the necessary congruence conditions (see comments).
%C A274471 A134419 consists of those n where x^2 - n*y^2 = n(n-1)(n+1)/3 has integer solutions for x and y. There are easily verified necessary congruence conditions for that to occur:
%C A274471   (defining x||y to mean x|y and x and y/x are coprime)
%C A274471   if 3^e||n with e>0, then e is odd and (n/3^e)=2 (mod 3);
%C A274471   if p^e||n with p=5 or 7 (mod 12), then e is even;
%C A274471   if 3^e||(n+1) with e>0, then e is odd;
%C A274471   if p^e||(n+1) with p=3 (mod 4) and p>3, then e is even.
%C A274471 However, these conditions are not sufficient. This sequence consists of the numbers n satisfying the congruence conditions but for which the Pellian equation has no integer solutions.
%C A274471 If n = k^2*m where m is squarefree, then a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for n to occur in this sequence is that the narrow class group of quadratic forms of discriminant 4*m has more than one class per genus, or equivalently that the narrow class group is not an elementary 2-group.
