%N A274240 Numbers n such that there is a smaller positive number j == n (mod 7) such that j*n is a square.
%C A274240 Or numbers n >= 16 having a divisor t^2 > 1, where t=k/m, 1 <= m < k, such that n == n/t^2 (mod 7).
%C A274240 Or positive numbers n such that if n == 0 (mod 7), then n is divisible by 7^3 or by the square of some other prime; otherwise n is divisible by k^2, such that there is a k_1, 0 < k_1 < k such that k_1^2 == k^2 (mod 7) (or, according to the comment in A130290, n is divisible by some k^2 >= 16).
%C A274240 For a generalization, see the seqfan list from Jun 13 (correction Jun 14) 2016.
%e A274240 25 is a member, since 4 == 25 (mod 7) and 4*25 is a square.
%e A274240 32 is a member, since 18 == 32 (mod 7) and 18*32 is a square.
