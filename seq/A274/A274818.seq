%N A274818 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = total number of regions in all arrangements of n circles in the affine plane forming k regions, including the regions that do not belong to the circles.
%C A274818 Consider the arrangements of n circles described in A250001.
%F A274818 T(n,k) = k*A274776(n,k).
%e A274818 Triangle begins:
%e A274818 1;
%e A274818 0, 4,  3;
%e A274818 0, 0, 12, 16, 10, 0, 28;
%e A274818 0, 0,  0, ...
%e A274818 ...
%e A274818 For n = 3 and k = 5 there are 2 arrangements of 3 circles in the affine plane forming 5 regions, including the regions that do not belong to the circles, so T(3,5) = 2*5 = 10.
%e A274818 For n = 3 and k = 6 there are no arrangements of 3 circles in the affine plane forming 6 regions, including the regions that do not belong to the circles, so T(3,6) = 0*5 = 0.
%e A274818 Of course, there is a right triangle of all zeros starting from the second row.
%Y A274818 Row sums give A274822.
%Y A274818 First differs from A274819 at a(10).
%Y A274818 Cf. A250001, A274776.
