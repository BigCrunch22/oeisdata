%N A274009 1's distance from a number in its binary expansion.
%C A274009 To generate the value for n, write out n's decimal expansion.  Then, write out 1's decimal expansion (0000000000....001).  Compute how many times you need to change 0 to a 1 or a 1 to a 0 in order to switch from one number to the other.
%C A274009 The value for 2^x is always 2.  The value for 2^x +1 is always 1.  The value for 2^x -1 is always x-1 when x > 0. To get to 2^x, you need to drop the 1 at the beginning and add the 1 in the 2^x place value.
%C A274009 For 2^x + 1, you need to add the 1 in the 2^n place value, but you keep the 1 in the 1s place value.  Thus you are only adding or getting rid of 1 digit.
%C A274009 For 2^x -1, it will have x digits, and all of them will be 1's.  You already have 1 in the 1's place value, so there are n-1 digits left over.
