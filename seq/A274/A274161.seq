%N A274161 Numbers n such that in the edge-delete game on the path P_{n} the first player does not have a winning strategy.
%C A274161 The edge-delete game on the graph G is as follows: Two players alternate turns, permanently deleting one edge from G on each turn. The game ends when a vertex is isolated in what remains of G. The player whose deletion created the isolated vertex loses the game.
%C A274161 Here P_{n} refers to the path with n vertices, not n edges.
%C A274161 a(n)-1 gives the zeros in the nim-sequence of octal game .4, see A002187. - _Zachary Winkeler_, Jul 10 2016

%e A274161 The number 7 is included because a path on 7 vertices has no winning strategy for player 1 (P1). Consider the edges labeled 1 through 6, left to right along the path. Without loss of generality, P1's first turn is 1, 2, or 3. P1 cannot delete 1 (an immediate loss). If P1 deletes 2, P2 deletes 4 or 5 to force an immediate loss on P1's next turn. If P1 deletes 3, P2 deletes 5 to force the loss.
