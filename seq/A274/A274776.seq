%N A274776 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = number of arrangements of n circles in the affine plane forming k regions, including the regions that do not belong to the circles.
%C A274776 Consider the arrangements of n circles described in A250001.
%C A274776 Note that the sum of the 4th row must be equal to A250001(4) = 173.
%F A274776 T(n,k) = A274818(n,k)/k.
%e A274776 Triangle begins:
%e A274776 1;
%e A274776 0, 2, 1;
%e A274776 0, 0, 4, 4, 2, 0, 4;
%e A274776 0, 0, 0, ...
%e A274776 ...
%e A274776 For n = 3 and k = 5 there are 2 arrangements of 3 circles in the affine plane forming 5 regions, including the regions that do not belong to the circles, so T(3,5) = 2.
%e A274776 For n = 3 and k = 6 there are no arrangements of 3 circles in the affine plane forming 6 regions, including the regions that do not belong to the circles, so T(3,6) = 0.
%e A274776 Of course, there is a right triangle of all zeros starting from the second row.
%Y A274776 Sum of n-th row = A250001(n).
%Y A274776 First differs from A274777 at a(10).
%Y A274776 Cf. A250001, A249752, A252158, A261070, A274818, A274822.
