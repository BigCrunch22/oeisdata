%N A274127 Numbers n for which 9 is a nontrivial quadratic residue mod n but 9 has only trivial quadratic residues +/- 3 mod each of the proper divisors of n.
%C A274127 This sequence is a subsequence of A273543; for m,k > 0, a(m) * k is in A273543. All terms of A273543 are of that form. In other words, these are the primitive terms of A273543.

%e A274127 x^2 == 9 (mod 16) has solutions 3, 5, 11 and 13, so x^2 == 9 (mod 16 * k) have these solutions, and possibly more as well. Only solutions to the equation x^2 == 9 (mod n) are shown where no proper divisor of n has nontrivial solutions. So 32 isn't shown as 16 has nontrivial solutions as well and is a proper divisor of 32.
