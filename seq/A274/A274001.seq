%N A274001 Even numbers with a unique resolution as the sum of two primes, each of which has a twin.
%C A274001 The sequence is infinite only if the number of twin primes is infinite.
%C A274001 Note that not all even integers can be written as the sum of two twins (e.g. 94, 96, 98,...).
%e A274001 6 = 3 + 3 is an element since (3,5) are twins, as is 8 = 5 + 3.
%e A274001 10 = 7 + 3 = 5 + 5 is not an element, since it is not uniquely resolved, even though the two resolutions both involve primes with twins.
