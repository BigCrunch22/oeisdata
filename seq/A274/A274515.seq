%N A274515 a(n) is the number of times that the value of ternary n when read as hyperbinary occurs in the set of hyperbinary representations.
%C A274515 Stern's diatomic sequence A002487 counts the ways (n+1) can be represented if one allows 2's to be included in (n)'s binary representation (its "hyperbinary representations" in the terminology of A002487). A065361 maps ternary ordering onto these hyperbinary representations.

%F A274515 a(n) = A002487(A065361(n) + 1).
%e A274515 5 in ternary is 12, which when read in hyperbinary is equal to 4. 6 in ternary is 20, which when read in hyperbinary is equal to 4. 9 in ternary is 100, which when read in hyperbinary is equal to 4. Since these are the only ways to represent 4 in hyperbinary, a(5) = a(6) = a(9) = 3.
