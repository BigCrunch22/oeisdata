%N A274226 Numbers that have a unique representation as a sum of three nonzero squares, and furthermore in this representation the squares are distinct.
%C A274226 The numbers in this sequence can be expressed as a sum of 3 positive squares in exactly one way, and those 3 squares are distinct. This is different from A025339.

%e A274226 14 is a term because it can be expressed in just one way as a sum of 3 squares (1^2+2^2+3^2) and the 3 squares are different.
%e A274226 38 is not a term, because, even if it can be expressed as a sum of 3 distinct squares in just one way (2^2+3^2+5^2), it can also be expressed as a sum of 3 non-distinct squares (1^2+1^2+6^2). This makes 38 a member of A004432 and A025339.
