%N A274263 Integer part of the ratio of consecutive prime gaps.
%C A274263 It seems that the distribution of the ratios of consecutive prime gaps exhibits a quite symmetric pattern, in the sense that the relative frequency of each ratio is similar to that of the inverse of that ratio (at least for the first 2*10^5 primes). This is more clearly seen by mean of a histogram of the logarithm of the ratios which is nearly symmetric and nearly centered around zero (see link).
