%N A274057 Even numbers n that cannot be written as the difference of two primes, each of which is one of a pair of twin primes, and one of which is < n.
%C A274057 There are no more terms less than 10^5.
%C A274057 There are no more terms less than 10^8. Probably there are no more terms; a CramÃ©r model predicts that the chance of more terms existing is less than 1 in 10^2000. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jun 17 2016
