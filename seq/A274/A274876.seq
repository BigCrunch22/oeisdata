%N A274876 The number of ways (2n)^2 is expressible as (p+1)(q+1) where p and q are distinct primes.
%C A274876 No odd number squared is expressible as (p+1)(q+1) where p and q are distinct primes, since q must be odd and therefore (q+1) is even.

%e A274876 a(1) = 0 since 2 is not expressible as (p+1)(q+1); same for a(2); a(3) = 1 since 6^2 = 36 = (2+1)(11+1); a(6) = 3 since 12^2 = 144 = (2+1)(47+1) = (5+1)(23+1) = (7+1)(17+1); a(9) = 2 since 18^2 = 324 = (2+1)(107+1) = (5+1)(53+1); etc.
