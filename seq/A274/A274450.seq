%N A274450 Largest number of antipower periods possible for a binary string of length n.
%C A274450 An antiperiod of a length-n string x is a divisor l of n such that if you factor x as the concatenation of (n/l) blocks of length l, then all these blocks are distinct.
%C A274450 It seems very likely that this sequence is sum{d|n} [n/d <= 2^d] where [...] is the Iverson bracket that is 1 if the condition is true and 0 otherwise, but I don't have a proof yet.
