%N A274213 Meta recurrence: a(0) = 1, a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3, a(n) = a(n - a(n-3)) + 3 for n > 2.
%C A274213 The sequence is constructed by starting with 3*m copies of 3*(m+1), followed by 3*m+1, 3*m+2, 3*m+3, as m varies from 0, 1, 2, ... It is straightforward to check that this construction satisfies the recurrence relation.
%C A274213 The construction shows that the sequence is well defined, every positive integer is in the sequence, and every integer not a proper multiple of 3 appears only once. If t is a multiple of 3, then t appears t-2 times.
%C A274213 In general, the meta recurrence a(n) = a(n-a(n-k))+k with initial conditions a(i) = i+1 for i = 0,...,k-1 has a simple solution and can be constructed starting with k*m copies of k*(m+1), followed by k*m+1, k*m+2, ..., k*(m+1), as m varies from 0, 1, 2, ... This sequence is well defined, every positive integer is in the sequence, and every integer not a proper multiple of k appears once. If t is a multiple of k, then t appears t-k+1 times.
