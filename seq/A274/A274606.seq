%N A274606 Pick any two successive integers in the sequence; there is a larger one (L) and a smaller one (S); the last digit of L is the remainder of L/S.
%C A274606 The sequence starts with a(1)=1 and is always extended with the smallest integer not yet in the sequence and not leading to a contradiction.
%C A274606 This sequence is probably a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A274606 After 10000 terms, the smallest integer not yet present in the sequence is 913 and the largest one present is 1144810.

%e A274606 The sequence starts with 1,10,2,11,5,12,60,3,30,6,31,15,32,160,... and indeed, 10/1 has 0 as remainder [the last digit of "10", which is the biggest term of the pair (1,10)]; 10/2 has 0 as remainder (again, the last digit of "10"); 11/2 has 1 as remainder; 11/5 has 1 as remainder; 12/5 has 2 as remainder; 60/12 has 0 as remainder; etc.
