%N A274779 Numbers whose square is the sum of two positive triangular numbers in exactly one way.
%C A274779 Obviously, A000217(n) + A000217(n+1) = n*(n+1)/2 + (n+1)*(n+2)/2 = (n+1)^2. So every square that is greater than 1 is the sum of two positive consecutive triangular numbers. This sequence focuses on the squares that have only this trivial solution.

%e A274779 3 is a term because 3^2 is the sum of two positive triangular numbers in exactly 1 way that is: 3^2 = 3 + 6.
