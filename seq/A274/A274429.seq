%N A274429 Numbers that are a product of two distinct Fibonacci numbers >1 or two distinct Lucas numbers > 0 (excluding 2).
%C A274429 Let U = {F(i)F(j), 2 < i < j}, where F = A000045 (Fibonacci numbers), and V = {L(i)L(j), 0 < i < j}, where L = A000032 (Lucas numbers).  The sets U and V are disjoint, and their union, arranged as a sequence in increasing order, is A274429.  (Unlike A274426, here all the Lucas numbers except 1 are included.)
%C A274429 Writing u for a Fibonacci product and v for a Lucas product, the numbers in A274429 are represented by the infinite word vvuvuvvuuvvuuvvvuuuvvvuuuvvvv...  This is the concatenation of v and the words (v^k)(u^k)(v^k)(u^k) for k >= 1.  Thus, there are runs of Fibonacci products of every finite length and runs of Lucas products of every finite length.
