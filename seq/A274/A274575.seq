%N A274575 For m=1,2,3,... write all the 2^m binary vectors of length m in increasing order, and replace each vector with (number of 1's) - (number of 0's). Start with an initial 0 for the empty vector.
%C A274575 This is the sequence of To-And-Fro positions: Positions of all backward-forward combinations in lexicographical order when assigning -1 to a backward move and +1 to a forward move and starting at 0.
%C A274575 -a(n) are the slopes of the different segments, from left to right, of the successive steps in the construction of the Takagi (a.k.a. Blancmange) function. - _Javier MÃºgica_, Dec 31 2017
