%N A274058 Relative of Hofstadter Q-sequence: a(n) = max(0, n+32478) for n <= 0; a(n) = a(n-a(n-1)) + a(n-a(n-2)) + a(n-a(n-3)) for n > 0.
%C A274058 Sequences like this are more naturally considered with the first nonzero term in position 1. But this sequence would then match A000027 for its first 32478 terms.
%C A274058 This sequence has exactly 37025 terms (of positive index).  a(37025) = 0, so an attempt to calculate a(37026) would refer to itself.
%C A274058 Without the convention that a(n) = 0 for n <= -32478, this sequence would have exactly 24 terms (of positive index), since computing a(25) refers to a(-64942).
%C A274058 If 32478 in this sequence's definition is replaced by any larger number congruent to 5 mod 7, the behavior is essentially the same, though the quasilinear part (see Formula section) lasts longer.

%F A274058 If the index is between 67 and 32479 (inclusive), then a(7n) = 7n+2, a(7n+1) = 7n+32480, a(7n+2) = 7n+32482, a(7n+3) = 7, a(7n+4) = 2n+65001, a(7n+5) = n+64949, a(7n+6) = 32476.
