%N A380151 Classification sequence for the Stolarsky array A035506.
%C A380151 The "classification sequence" of a Stolarsky interspersion is defined to be the second column minus the floor of the first column times tau = (1+sqrt(5))/2.
%H A380151 Clark Kimberling, <a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/FQ/Scanned/32-4/kimberling.pdf">The first column of a Stolarsky interspersion</a>, Fib. Quart. 32 (1994), 301-315.
%F A380151 a(n) = A035487(n) - floor(tau*A007064(n)).
%F A380151 a(n) = 1 if {gamma+tau*n} < 1/2, and 0 otherwise, where {...} denotes fractional part and gamma = (3-tau)/2. Kimberling (1994, p. 314) asked for a "convenient" formula for a(n) and this is it.  Proved with the theorem-prover Walnut.
%Y A380151 Cf. A007064, A035487, A035506.
