%N A380372 Characteristic function of A082851.
%C A380372 This sequence is the limit S(infinity) of replications starting S(0) = {} and then S(k) = {S(k-1), S(k-1), 0,0,â€¦,0,1} where the 0,...,0,1 run is k terms long (k-1 0's followed by a 1).
%C A380372 Runs of terms 0,...,0,1 have lengths A082850.
%e A380372 The S construction of for instance S(3), which is terms a(1) to a(11), is
