%e A380539 For n = 1, the least prime not dividing it is 2, and the second least prime not dividing is 3, thus a(1) = 3.
%e A380539 For n = 3, the least nondividing prime is 2, the second least nondividing prime is 5, thus a(3) = 5.
%e A380539 For n = 6 = 2*3, the least nondividing prime is 5, and the second least nondividing prime is 7, thus a(6) = 7.
