%N A380868 Number of distinct solutions {n1, n2, n3, n4} to the problem of forming a rectangle with sides made of linked rods of length 1, ..., n.
%C A380868 A solution to the problem is given by n1 > n2 > n3 > n4 >= 0 such that T(n) = 2*(A+B) with side lengths A = T(n1) - T(n2) = T(n3) - T(n4) and B = T(n2) - T(n3), where T = A000217.
%C A380868 When n4 = 0, this means that the rods of length 1 and n meet in a corner. When there are two consecutive n_k's (e.g. n1 = 7, n2 = 6 for n = 8) this means that one side is made of one single rod, of length equal to the larger of the two n_k's
%C A380868 Nonzero terms are at indices listed in A380867.
%C A380868 Conjectures: (1) All terms are triangular numbers. [D. Mondot, cf. link to SeqFan post.] (2) All triangular numbers do appear.
%C A380868 Note that these numbers don't appear for the first time in order of increasing size, for example the first n with 45 solutions is 935, while a(440) = 55 and a(539) = 66. [D. Mondot, cf. link to SeqFan post.]

%e A380868 The only solution for n = 8 is depicted in A380867.
%e A380868 a(n = 20) = 3 is the first case where we have several distinct solutions,
%e A380868  {5, 11, 15, 18}, {0, 11, 14, 18} and {0, 5, 14, 15}, The corresponding triangular numbers, whose differences give the side lengths, are {15, 66, 120, 171}, {0, 66, 105, 171} and {0, 15, 105, 120}.
