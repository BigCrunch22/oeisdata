%N A380530 Positions of records in A380528.
%C A380530 Questions: Are all terms squarefree after 4, and do all terms end (in base ten) with digit 6 from the fifth term onward? Is the sequence infinite? Are there any terms with more than four prime factors? See also the conjecture given in A380475, and A380476.
%C A380530 For n = 1..10, A380528(a(n)) = A008578(n). If a(11) exists, it is > 2^30.
