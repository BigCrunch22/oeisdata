%N A380328 2-dense numbers that are squarefree.
%C A380328 This sequence is a subsequence of primitive practical numbers because the sequence of 2-dense numbers is a subsequence of practical numbers and all squarefree practical numbers are by definition primitive practical numbers.
%C A380328 Similar to and a subsequence of A265501.
%F A380328 Intersection of A005117 and A174973.
%e A380328 a(5) = 42 and its prime factorization is 2*3*7 and squarefree. Also the proper divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 21, 42 they are 2-dense and therefore 42 is practical as well as being primitive practical.
