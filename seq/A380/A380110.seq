%N A380110 a(n) is the number of configurations of a generalization of the nine dots problem for an n X n grid, where all dots must be connected using straight lines and certain constraints are followed.
%C A380110 The generalization of the nine dots problem involves extending the classic puzzle to more dots or different configurations. This requires new strategies or insights to connect all the dots with straight lines while adhering to similar constraints.
%C A380110 Rules for the generalization of the nine dots problem:
%C A380110 1. All dots must be connected together.
%C A380110 2. No curved lines are allowed, only straight lines are to be used.
%C A380110 3. Number of lines allowed is n*n where n is the number of dots in a vertical row.
%C A380110 4. Symmetries or rotations are considered the same when counting the number of unique configurations.
%C A380110 5. No folding or bending of the grid and the paper and all solutions should be on a grid which is on a 2 dimensional flat plain.
