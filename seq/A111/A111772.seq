%N A111772 Number of non-isomorphic Average systems with n elements. An Average system has one binary operation "avg" and satisfies the three axioms avg(A,A)=A, avg(A,B)=avg(B,A), avg(avg(A,B),avg(C,D)) = avg(avg(A,C),avg(B,D)).
%C A111772 Axiom 1 is idempotence; axiom 2 is commutativity. The only unfamiliar axiom is the third one, mid-quarter-swap, a kind of tree-editing axiom. Together with commutativity, it allows free permutation of nodes at each specific level of a binary tree representing an expression.
%C A111772 The Average axioms are also satisfied by lower semilattices, a.k.a., idempotent commutative semigroups, by finite Abelian groups with an odd number of elements and by hybrids of these two types.

%e A111772 n is the size of the system.
%e A111772 Systems is the count of non-isomorphic systems of that size.
%e A111772 Tables is the total number of tables, with no culling for isomorphism.
%e A111772 Group orders is the number of systems with each size of automorphism group.
%e A111772 For example, there are 314 non-isomorphic Average systems with 7 elements.
%e A111772 85 of those systems have the trivial automorphism group (only the identity),
%e A111772 and each system gives rise to 7! = 5040 distinct tables. There's one
%e A111772 system with an automorphism group of 720 elements, which gives rise to only
%e A111772 5040/720 = 7 different tables. The total number of possible 7-element tables
%e A111772 is 7^49, of which roughly 7^7 satisfy the Average rules.
%e A111772 We have the obvious identities 314 = 85 + 122 + 32 + ... + 1 + 2 + 1 and 819330 = 5040 * (85/1 + 122/2 + 32/4 + ... + 1/72 + 2/120 + 1/720).
