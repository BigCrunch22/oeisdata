%N A111039 Start with the positive integers, and at the n-th step, remove every (a(n)+1)-st term from the list of numbers remaining, for n = 1, 2, 3, ...
%C A111039 A variation on lucky numbers A000959: To get these, remove at the n-th step every a(n)-th remaining number, except for n = 1, where at the 1st step the even numbers are removed (as here).
%e A111039 Start with A = [1, 2, 3, 4, ...]. For n = 1 (the 1st step), we have a(1)+1 = 1+1 = 2, so we remove every 2nd number. Then only the list A' of odd numbers remains.
%e A111039 For n = 2 (the 2nd step), we have a(2)+1 = 3+1 = 4, so we remove every 4th number from the list A', it remains A'' = [1,3,5,  9,11,13,  17,19,21, 25,...].
%e A111039 For n = 3 (the 3rd step), we have a(3) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6, so we remove every 6th number from the above list A'' of remaining numbers. It remains A''' = [1,3,5,9,11,  17,19,21,25,27, 31,...].
%e A111039 For n = 4 (the 4th step), we have a(4)+1 = 9+1 = 10, and we remove every 10th number from the list A'''. And so on.
%e A111039 a(4) = 9, not 7 because 7 was removed during the 2nd iteration with the rest of the (a(2)+1)th numbers (15, 23, 31, 39, etc.) in the sequence remaining after the 1st iteration.
