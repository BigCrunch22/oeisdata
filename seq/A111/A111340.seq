%N A111340 Related to frieze patterns.
%C A111340 The n-th term is the number of positive integer tables a(i,n) (with i running from 1 to n+3 and n running from minus infinity to infinity) subject to the boundary conditions a(i,n) = 0 when i = 1 or i = n+3 and a(i,n) = 1 when i = 2 or i = n+2 and the internal condition a(i,n-1) a(i,n+1) = a(i-1,n) a(i+1,n) + a(i,n) when i is strictly between 2 and n+2.
%C A111340 It is not known as of this writing whether any or all of the terms of the sequence beyond 868 are finite. If the final term "a(i,n)" in the internal condition is replaced by "1", then what we are looking is just a frieze pattern a la Conway and Coxeter (or rather two interlaced frieze patterns that do not interact at all).
%C A111340 According to the lecture notes by S. Morier-Genoud (see paragraph "2-frieze of positive integers"), a(5) is conjectured to be 26952, and it is proved that there are no more finite terms. - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Nov 01 2022
