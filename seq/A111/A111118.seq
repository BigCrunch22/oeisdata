%N A111118 a(1) = 1; skipping over integers occurring earlier in the sequence, count down c(n) (c(n) = n-th composite) from a(n) to get a(n+1). If this is <= 0, instead count up from a(n) c(n) positions (skipping already occurring integers) to get a(n+1).
%C A111118 If we did not skip earlier occurring integers when counting, we would instead have sequence A100298.
%e A111118 The first 4 terms of the sequence can be plotted on the number line as:
%e A111118 1,2,*,*,5,*,*,*,*,*,11,*,*.
%e A111118 Now a(4) is 2. Counting c(4) = 9 down from 2 gets a negative integer. So we instead count up 9 positions, skipping the 5 and 11 as we count, to arrive at 13 (which is at the rightmost * of the number line above).
%Y A111118 Cf. A100298, A110080, A002808.
