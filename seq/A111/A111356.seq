%N A111356 Numbers n such that the number of numbers "unrelated to n" is itself unrelated to n.
%F A111356 {a(n)} = {n: A045763(n) is not [a divisor of n] and is not [relatively prime to n] and is not 0}. {a(n)} = {n: n + 1 - d(n) - phi(n) is not [a divisor of n] and is not [relatively prime to n]}. where d is the number of divisors of n and phi is Euler's totient function. I am defining 0 to be not unrelated to n.
%e A111356 The first value to be neither 0 (excluded from definition) nor 1 (always a divisor of n) is 10, for which A045763(10) = 3; but 3 is relatively prime to 10, hence not unrelated to 10, so 10 is not in this sequence. The second value to be neither 0 (excluded from definition) nor 1 (always a divisor of n) is 12, for which A045763(12) = 3; but 3 is a divisor of 12, hence not unrelated to 12, so 12 is not in this sequence.
%e A111356 a(1) = 21 because A045763(21) = 6, which is unrelated to 21 (shares the divisor 3).
%e A111356 a(2) = 24 because A045763(24) = 9, which is unrelated to 24 (shares the divisor 3).
