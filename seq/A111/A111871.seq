%N A111871 Prime gaps q-p with n-th record merit referred to in A111870.
%C A111871 The prime gaps q-p (corresponding to a(n)=p in A111870) have increasing record merit (q-p)/log(p). However, the prime gaps themselves are almost always monotonically increasing (with very high probability), but not always! And we do have an exception in the list above: a(14)=148 < a(13)=154! (But see next comment!)
%C A111871 Because the erroneous A111870(13) = 4652353 term was removed, a(13) = 154 was removed. This sequence is therefore monotonically increasing. - _John W. Nicholson_, Nov 18 2013

%F A111871 a(n) = A277552(n) - A111870(n). - _Bobby Jacobs_, Nov 13 2016
%e A111871 A111870(4) = 113 and the next larger prime is 127, so 127 - A111870(4) = a(4) = 14.
%Y A111871 For the primes p corresponding to the prime gaps q-p with n-th record merit, see A111870.
