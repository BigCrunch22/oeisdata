%N A111095 n = Sum_{b} c_b*b! in the factorial base rewritten by c_b-fold repetition of b, b=1,2,3,....
%C A111095 The integer n has a unique "greedy" representation in the factorial base as n = Sum_{b>=1} c_b*b!, see A007623.
%C A111095 The number of coefficients c_b is A084558(n).
%C A111095 The current sequence starts from an empty string, scans the coefficients c_b in the order b=1,2,3,..., i.e., reads A007623(n) from the least to the most significant position, and appends b c_b times to the string. The resulting string is shown in the sequence as a standard decimal number a(n).

%e A111095 a(39) = 12334 with A007623(39) = 1211, because 1! + 2! + 3! + 3! + 4! = 1 + 2 + 6 + 6 + 24 = 39
