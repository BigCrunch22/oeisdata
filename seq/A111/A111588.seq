%N A111588 Crazy Dice: number of ways to design a pair of n-sided dice with positive integers on their faces, so that the sums when they are tossed occur with the same probabilities as if a pair of standard n-sided dice were tossed.
%C A111588 It is not required that the two dice be identical, it is not required that the entries be bounded by n and we do not ask that the entries be distinct from one another on each cube.
%C A111588 We pretend for the purpose of this sequence that regular n-sided dice exist for all n.
%C A111588 In other words, how many (unordered) pairs of polynomials B(x) = x^b_1 + x^b_2 + ... + x^b_n, C(x) = x^c_1 + x^c_2 + ... + x^c_n, are there with all exponents positive integers, such that B(x)*C(x) = (x+x^2+x^3+...+x^n)^2?
%C A111588 a(n) = 1 means that the only way two n-sided dice can have the same probability distribution as two normal n-sided dice (each side numbered 1 through n) is if they are normal. a(6) = 2 corresponds to normal dice and Sicherman dice (one labeled 1,2,2,3,3,4 and the other 1,3,4,5,6,8). - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jan 19 2017
%C A111588 Records are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, 33, 57, 140, 348, 583, 956, 2036, 2393, 3050, ... and they seem to occur at positions given by A033833. - _Antti Karttunen_, Aug 28 2017

%e A111588 The first nontrivial example is for n=4: {1,2,2,3} and {1,3,3,5} together have the same sum probabilities as a pair of {1,2,3,4}. That is, (x + 2x^2 + x^3)(x + 2x^3 + x^5)=(x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4)^2.
