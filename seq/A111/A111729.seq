%N A111729 Historical progression of years from the song "In The Year 2525" by Denny Zager and Rick Evans.
%C A111729 Sequence is potentially cyclic. #1 Billboard hit 1969. Last "2525" added because first verse repeats at the end. Note that it also begins to transition into the second verse again after this in some editions, causing "3535" to be faintly audible. The lyrics of the song also imply the sequence is theoretically cyclic and recurring, with the final 2525 being the beginning of the second iteration.

%F A111729 for n < 6 or n=8, a(n) = 101*(10n+15). For n=6 or 7, a(n) is irregular, and is equal to 101*(10n+15) with the exception that the final two digits are fixed at 10. Assuming the cyclic sequence, for n > 8, a(n) = f(n mod 8), with the exception that when n mod 8 = 0, take a(n) = n(8) = 9595.
%e A111729 The opening lyric is "In the year 2525/if man is still alive/if woman can survive/they may find..." hence a(1)=2525.
