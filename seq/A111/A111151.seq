%N A111151 Numbers not of the form a^2 + b^3 + c^4 + d^5 for a,b,c,d >= 0.
%C A111151 It is conjectured that this list is complete.
%C A111151 Comments from Richard C. Schroeppel: (Start)
%C A111151 "I can't put my hand on the book, but I think Vaughn has shown that every sufficiently large number is of the form a^2+b^3+c^5.
%C A111151 The key is that the sum 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5 = 31/30 > 1, so the expected number of representations for a number N is, on average, K * N^1/30.
%C A111151 K is some mess of gamma(fractions). [It's also necessary to check that there's no modular exclusion.] I once tried to estimate how large an N was "sufficiently large" and if I remember correctly got around 10^60.
%C A111151 The results for a^2+b^3+c^4+d^5 and a^2+b^3+c^4+d^5+e^6 would follow immediately, although proving an upper bound is a big question. I'm not even sure if Vaughn's proof is constructive.
%C A111151 _Christopher Landauer_ worked on the 2...6 problem long long ago; I think his program got up to a million or so.
%C A111151 There was a paper in Math. Comp. about five years ago, about the problem of 4 cubes. Beeler & I tried to find the empirical last-unrepresentable number, but couldn't reach it. The Math. Comp. paper found a likely candidate. It was around 10^13 or 14." (End)
