%N A111157 Numbers n such that sequence A_n in this database does not contain a prime.
%C A111157 That is, the complete sequence A_n, not just the terms that are shown in the entry, does not contain a prime or the negative of a prime. The only exception to this is for sequences with keyword "dead", when only the visible terms are to be considered.
%C A111157 No other terms below 287. Is 287 a member? This requires proof.
%C A111157 I've checked A000287 up to a(25000) and can report that I found no prime. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Jun 23 2014
