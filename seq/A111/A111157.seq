%N A111157 Numbers k such that sequence A_k in this database does not contain a prime.
%C A111157 That is, the complete sequence A_k, not just the terms that are shown in the entry, does not contain a prime or the negative of a prime. The only exception to this is for sequences with keyword "dead", when only the visible terms are to be considered.
%C A111157 No other terms below 287. Is 287 a member? This requires proof.
%C A111157 I've checked A000287 up to a(25000) and can report that I found no prime. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Jun 23 2014
%C A111157 A search of every term of A000287 of form a(2^k-2) has yielded no primes up to a(2^24-2). It shouldn't have any odd terms outside this subsequence, and assuming that its terms' factors are otherwise random, it has a 2.15*10^-8 probability of containing any prime at all. After A000287, the next difficult sequence is A000373, which should contain infinitely many primes, but has none within its first 10000 terms. - _Matthew House_, Nov 02 2024
