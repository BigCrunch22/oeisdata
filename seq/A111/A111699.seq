%N A111699 a(1)=1. Skipping over integers occurring earlier in the sequence, count down b(n) (b(n)= number of earlier terms of {a(k)} which are coprime to n) from a(n-1) to get a(n). If this is <= 0, instead count up from a(n-1) b(n) positions (skipping already occurring integers) to get a(n).

%e A111699 The first 6 terms of the sequence can be plotted on the number line as:
%e A111699 1,2,3,4,*,*,7,8,*,*,*,*,*.
%e A111699 Now a(6) is 7. Counting b(7) = 5 (because all earlier terms but the 7 are coprime to 7) down from 7 gets a negative integer. So we instead count up 5 positions, skipping the 8 as we count, to arrive at 13 (which is at the rightmost * of the number line above).
