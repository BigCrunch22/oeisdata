%N A111771 Construct a grid containing the numbers from 1 to 110, laid out as shown below. If you start at 1 and go right 1, then down 2, then left 3, then up 4, then right 5, then down 6 and so on, being sure to wrap around if you go off an edge (e.g., going right from 10 will go to 1) you will land on these numbers in order.
%C A111771 Interestingly, this pattern visits every number from 1 to 110 twice before repeating the pattern.
%e A111771 The last two numbers before it repeats are 1,1 because 1 is the 219 term and you go right by 220 increments wrapping around when you reach the end and land on 1 again, then go right 221 spaces and land on 2, where the pattern repeats.
