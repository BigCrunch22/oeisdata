%N A111450 Least perfect power ending in n. 0 if no perfect power ends in n. e.g. a(10) = a(15) = 0.
%C A111450 a(10^n) =0 = a(10k+5),if 10k + 5 is not==0 (mod 25). Are there any other numbers r such that a(r) =0?
%e A111450 a(14) = 0 because any number ending in 14 is even but not divisible by 4 and any even power is divisible by 4. [From _David Wasserman_, Jan 15 2009]
