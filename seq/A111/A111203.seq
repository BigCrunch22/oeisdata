%N A111203 x such that pi(x)/li(x) is greater than it is for all smaller x > 1.5.
%C A111203 This will be a very long but finite sequence, since pi(x)/li(x) will exceed unity for some very large values of x (as Littlewood first showed) but then will asymptotically tend to unity by the prime number theorem. One large but unknown element of the sequence will be the smallest x for which pi(x)>li(x).
%e A111203 For 1.5<x<2, li(x)>0 and pi(x)=0, so pi(x)/li(x)=0. a(1)=2 because at x=2, pi(x)/li(x) has its increase, to 1/li(2)=0.9567878442. a(2)=1051 because x=1051 gives the next time pi(x)/li(x) gives a higher value, 177/Li(1051)=0.956932676.
