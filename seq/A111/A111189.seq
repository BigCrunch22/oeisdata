%N A111189 Number of polyanygons (or Pollyannagons) with score n, with all symmetries removed.
%C A111189 Polyanygons are like polyominoes, but they are built by gluing together arbitrary regular polygons of side 1.
%C A111189 The score for a polyanygon is the total of its components' scores. Triangle = 1, square = 2, N-gon = N-2.
%C A111189 Holes are allowed. Nonzero area overlap of polygons is forbidden. Glued edges must line up vertex to vertex. Non-glued edges may occasionally have a slide offset and vertices may touch edges internally or contact other vertices. Higher scoring polyanygons can have partially offset edges, so the perimeter is not always an integer.
%C A111189 A regular hexagon is regarded as different from the same shape made out of six triangles and a dodecagon is different from a hexagon plus an alternating triangle/square fringe. Two polyanygons made of the same regular polygons in the same relative positions and orientations, but differing in order of assembly or which edges are glued, are considered the same.
%e A111189 The 3 polyanygons of score 3 are the triamond (three equilateral triangles), a square stuck to a triangle (a house) and the regular pentagon.
