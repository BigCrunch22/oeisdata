%N A111479 a(n) = least positive number such that (2 Concat Concat_{k=1}^n Repeat(A045572(n), a(n))) is a prime. A045572 = odd numbers not divisible by 5.
%C A111479 Concat is the operator that concatenates two numbers as decimal strings and Repeat returns the number obtained by concatenating the first argument to itself the second argument number of times.
%e A111479 21 is not a prime, but 211 is, so a(1)=2.
%e A111479 211,2113,21137777 are all primes. 21137777 is a prime obtained as 2 followed by two 1's, one 3 and four 7's, so a(2) = 4.
