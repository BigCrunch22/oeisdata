%N A111097 Maximum likelihood estimate of the number of distinguishable marbles in an urn if repeated random sampling of one marble with replacement yields n different marbles before the first repeated marble.
%C A111097 The numbers in my sequence match the first 8 nonzero numbers in sequence A083704 and the first 40 terms (at least) remain very close to those in A083704 . The program below is very crude and will yield the first 20 terms. To get further terms, one must increase the maximum value of n and then increase the maximum value of k so that the maximum value of k is larger than a(n) for the maximum value of n.
%F A111097 No formula yet, but I want to stake my claim.
%e A111097 a(3)=5 because of all urns containing marbles numbered 1, 2, 3, ..., k, an urn containing k = 5 marbles has the largest probability of yielding 3 different marbles before a first repeated marble when sampling with replacement.
%t A111097 thetable = Table[N[n/k*Product[(k - i)/k, {i, 1, n - 1}]], {n, 1, 20}, {k, 1, 300}]; maximums = Map[Max, thetable]; maximumlikelihoodestimates = {}; For[i = 1, i <= Length[thetable], i++, maximumlikelihoodestimates = Append[maximumlikelihoodestimates, Position[thetable[[i]], maximums[[i]]]]]; maximumlikelihoodestimates
