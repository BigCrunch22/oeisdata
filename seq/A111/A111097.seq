%N A111097 Maximum likelihood estimate of the number of distinguishable marbles in an urn if repeated random sampling of one marble with replacement yields n different marbles before the first repeated marble.
%C A111097 The numbers in my sequence match the first 8 nonzero numbers in sequence A083704 and the first 40 terms (at least) remain very close to those in A083704. The program below is very crude and will yield the first 20 terms. To get further terms, one must increase the maximum value of n and then increase the maximum value of k so that the maximum value of k is larger than a(n) for the maximum value of n.
%e A111097 a(3)=5 because of all urns containing marbles numbered 1, 2, 3, ..., k, an urn containing k = 5 marbles has the largest probability of yielding 3 different marbles before a first repeated marble when sampling with replacement.
%t A111097 thetable = Table[N[n/k*Product[(k - i)/k, {i, 1, n - 1}]], {n, 1, 20}, {k, 1, 300}]; maximums = Map[Max, thetable]; maximumlikelihoodestimates = {}; For[i = 1, i <= Length[thetable], i++, maximumlikelihoodestimates = Append[maximumlikelihoodestimates, Position[thetable[[i]], maximums[[i]]]]]; maximumlikelihoodestimates
