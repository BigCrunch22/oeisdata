%N A111755 Excess of n over a greedy sum of distinct squares.
%C A111755 Start with the value n and subtract the largest square (not previously used) less than or equal to n to get a new value. Repeat until the value 0 is reached or the square 1 has been subtracted. The resulting value is a(n). It is not hard to prove that a(n) always lies in 0..3 inclusive.
%C A111755 All nonzero terms are one greater than the previous term. - _Iain Fox_, Oct 17 2018
