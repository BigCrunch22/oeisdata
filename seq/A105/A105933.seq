%N A105933 An eight-symbol substitution on an hypertetrahedron with two symbol connection per vertex : limited to coverage of the connections : characteristic polynomial:x^8-4*x^&5-4*x^4-8*x^3.
%C A105933 This flow can be visualized in 3d by using a cube's vertices as the substitution for the eight points.
