%N A105821 Triangle of the numbers of different forests with one or more isolated vertices. Those forests have order N and m trees.
%C A105821 The unique tree with an isolated node has order one. For N > 1 and m > 1 there is at least one partition of N in m parts, with a part equal to 1, so a(n) > 0, when m > 1 and a(n) = 0, when m = 1 and N > 1. A095133(n) = A105821(n) + A105820(n).
%C A105821 a(2*n+1,n+1) = A215930(n) for n>=0. - _Alois P. Heinz_, Jul 10 2013

%F A105821 a(n) = sum over the partitions of N: 1K1 + 2K2 + ... + NKN, with exactly m parts and one or more parts equal to 1, of Product_{i=1..N} binomial(A000055(i)+Ki-1, Ki).
%e A105821 a(5,2) = 2 because 5 vertices can be partitioned in two trees only in one way: one tree gets 4 nodes and the other tree gets 1. Since A000055(4) = 2 and A000055(1) = 1, there are 2 forests. The forests of order less than or equal to 5 are depicted in the Weisstein "Forest" link.
