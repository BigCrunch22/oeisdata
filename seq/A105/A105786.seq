%N A105786 Triangle of the numbers of different forests of m unrooted trees of smallest order 2, i.e., without isolated vertices, on N labeled nodes.
%C A105786 Forests of order N with m components, m > floor(N/2) must contain an isolated vertex since it is impossible to partition N vertices in floor(N/2) + 1 or more trees without giving only one vertex to a tree.
%C A105786 Also the Bell transform of A000272(n+1) (with a(0)=0). For the definition of the Bell transform see A264428. - _Peter Luschny_, Jan 27 2016
%F A105786 a(n)= 0, if m > floor(N/2) (see comments), or can be calculated by the sum Num/D over the partitions of N: 1K1 + 2K2+ ... + nKN, with exactly m parts and smallest part = 2, where Num = N!*Product_{i=1..N}i^((i-2)Ki) and D = Product_{i=1..N}(Ki!(i!)^Ki).
%e A105786 a(8) = 3 because 4 vertices can be partitioned in two trees only in one way: both trees receiving 2 vertices. The unique tree on 2 vertices can be labeled in binomial(4,2) ways and to each one of the binomial(4,2) = 6 possibilities there is just another tree of order 2 in a forest. But since we have 2 trees of the same order, i.e., 2, we must divide binomial(4,2) by 2!.
