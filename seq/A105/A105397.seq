%N A105397 Periodic with period 2: repeat [4,2].
%C A105397 A simple "Fractal Jump Sequence" (FJS).  An FJS is a sequence of digits containing an infinite number of copies of itself. Modus operandi: underline the first digit "a" of such a sequence then jump over the next "a" digits and underline the digit "b" on which you land. Jump from there over the next "b" digits and underline the digit "c" on which you land. Etc. The "abc...n..." succession of underlined digits is the sequence itself.
