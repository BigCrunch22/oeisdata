%N A105399 Largest prime <= numbers of the form 6k+3 (duplicates removed).
%C A105399 Apart from the initial 3, the same as A049591. [Proof from T. Khovanova, Jan 23 2008: True for primes up to 5 by inspection. Higher primes must be of the form 6k+1 or 6k+5 since 6k+2 and 6k+4 are divisible by 2 and 6k+3 is divisible by 3. So searching the prime p backwards from the composite, odd 6k+3 in steps of 2 implies that p+2, skipped during that scan, is composite. So p is not in A001359 but in A049591.] - _R. J.
