%N A105488 Number of partitions of {1...n} containing 2 detached pairs of consecutive integers, i.e., partitions in which only 1- or 2-strings of consecutive integers can appear in a block and there are exactly two 2-strings.
%C A105488 Number of partitions enumerated by A105479 in which the maximal length of consecutive integers in a block is 2.
%C A105488 With offset 2t, number of partitions of {1...N} containing 2 detached strings of t consecutive integers, where N=n+2j, t=2+j, j = 0,1,2,..., i.e., partitions of [n] in which only v-strings of consecutive integers can appear in a block, where v=1 or v=t and there are exactly two t-strings.
%C A105488 Equals the minimum of the sum of the Rand distances over all A000110(n) set partitions of n elements. E.g. a(3) = 6 because over the 5 set partitions of {1, 2, 3} the sum of Rand distances from {{1}, {2}, {3}} to the rest is 6. - Andrey Goder (andy.goder(AT)gmail.com), Dec 08 2006
%C A105488 a(n+3) = A000110(n) * A000217(n) = Sum_{k=1..n} A285362(n,k) is the sum of the entries in all set partitions of [n]. - _Alois P. Heinz_, Apr 16 2017
