%N A105496 A "Fractal Jump Sequence" (FJS) that reappears twice (itself and itself + 1; see the Comments section).
%C A105496 Start on a(1) = 1 and underline it;
%C A105496 from there, jump over 1 term to the right; you land on a(3) = 2, which you underline;
%C A105496 from there, jump over 2 terms to the right; you'll land on a(6) = 2, which you underline;
%C A105496 from there, jump over 2 terms to the right; you'll land on a(9) = 3, which you underline;
%C A105496 from there, jump over 3 terms to the right; you'll land on a(13) = 3, which you underline;
%C A105496 from there, jump over 3 terms to the right; you'll land on a(17) = 2, which you underline; etc.
%C A105496 The underlined terms reproduce the starting sequence. The not underlined terms are the successive terms of the starting sequence augmented by 1.
%Y A105496 Cf. A330639 (multiplying by 2 the non-underlined terms instead of adding 1 to them).
