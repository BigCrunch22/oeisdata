%e A105753 Sequence reads from the beginning:
%e A105753 - at position a(1)=1 we see the sum of all previously written terms [indeed, nil + 1=1]
%e A105753 - at position a(2)=3 we see the sum of all previously written terms [indeed, 1+ 3=4]
%e A105753 - at position a(3)=4 we see the sum of all previously written terms [indeed, 1+3+4=8]
%e A105753 - at position a(4)=8 we see the sum of all previously written terms [indeed, 1+3+4+8=16]
%e A105753 - at position a(5)=6 we see the sum of all previously written terms [indeed, 1+3+4+8+6=22]
%e A105753 - at position a(6)=22 we see the sum of all previously written terms [indeed, 1+3+4+8+6+22=44 and 44 is the 22nd term of S]
%e A105753 etc.
