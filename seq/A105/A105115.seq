%N A105115 Numbers k such that the decimal representation of 1/k is neither terminating nor purely repeating.
%C A105115 k is in this sequence iff 1) k is divisible by 2 or 5 and 2) k is also divisible by some prime other than 2 and 5. Contains the numbers that are in neither A003592 nor A045572.
%C A105115 The asymptotic density of this sequence is 3/5. - _Amiram Eldar_, Mar 26 2021
