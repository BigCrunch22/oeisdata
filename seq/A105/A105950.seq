%N A105950 12 symbol hyper5tetrahedron : three tetrahedra with 5 connections per vertex: a triangle of tetrahedra connected.
%C A105950 This hyper5tetrahedron can be projected in 3d on an icosahedron. The characteristic polynomials has the roots: {{x -> -2.}, {x -> -2.}, {x -> -2.}, {x -> -2.}, {x -> -2.}, {x -> -2.}, { x -> 1.}, {x -> 1.}, {x -> 1.}, {x -> 2.}, {x -> 2.}, {x -> 5.}} which is in geometrical terms stereo-isometric.
