%N A105087 Absolute difference between the sums of the left and right diagonals of ordered 2 X 2 prime squares.
%C A105087 The first 2 X 2 prime square of a set of ordered 2 X 2 prime squares begins with 2. Just a 2 X 2 prime square is any 4 consecutive primes arranged in a square formation.
%F A105087 A 2 X 2 ordered prime square is 4 consecutive primes arranged in a square of the form p(4n-3) p(4n-2) p(4n-1) p(4n) where n=1, 2, ... and Left diagonal is p(4n+1), p(4n) Right diagonal is p(4n+2), p(4n+3).
%e A105087 The 4th prime square is
%e A105087 41 43
%e A105087 47 53
%e A105087 sum of left diagonal = 41+53 = 94
%e A105087 sum of right diagonal = 43+47 = 90
%e A105087 difference = 4
%e A105087 So 4 is the 4th term.
%o A105087 (PARI) diffdiag(n) = { local(x,d1,d2); forstep(x=1,n,4, d1=prime(x)+ prime(x+3); d2=prime(x+1)+ prime(x+2); print1(abs(d1-d2)",") ) }
