%C A105751 From _Peter Bala_, Jun 01 2023: (Start)
%C A105751 Compare with A105750(n) = the real part of Product_{k = 0..n} (1 + k*sqrt(-1)). Moll (2012) studied the prime divisors of the terms of A105750 and divided the primes into three classes. Numerical calculation suggests that a similar division holds in this case.
%C A105751 Type 1: primes p that do not divide any element of the sequence {a(n)}.
%C A105751 In this case, unlike in A105750, the set of type 1 primes is empty; that is, every prime p divides some term of this sequence.
%C A105751 Type 2: primes p such that the p-adic valuation v_p(a(n)) has asymptotically linear behavior. An example is given below.
%C A105751 We conjecture that the set of type 2 primes consists of primes p == 1 (mod 4), equivalently, rational primes that split in the field extension Q(sqrt(-1)) of Q, together with the prime p = 2, which ramifies in Q(sqrt(-1)). See A002144.
%C A105751 Moll's conjecture 5.5 extends to this sequence and takes the form:
%C A105751 (i) the 2-adic valuation v_2(a(n)) ~ n/4 as n -> oo.
%C A105751 (ii) for the other primes of type 2, the p-adic valuation v_p(a(n)) ~ n/(p - 1) as n -> oo.
%C A105751 Type 3: primes p such that the sequence of p-adic valuations {v_p(a(n)) : n >= 0} exhibits an oscillatory behavior (this phrase is not precisely defined). An example is given below.
%C A105751 We conjecture that the set of type 3 primes consists of primes p == 3 (mod 4), equivalently, rational primes that remain inert in the field extension Q(sqrt(-1)) of Q. See A002145. (End)
