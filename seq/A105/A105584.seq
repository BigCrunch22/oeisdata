%N A105584 Fixed point of the morphism 1 -> 34, 2 -> 32, 3 -> 12, 4 -> 14, starting from a(0) = 1.
%C A105584 A triangle space fill substitution: characteristic polynomial:x^4-2*x^3-2*x^2-4*x.
%C A105584 This triangle set was obtained by shifting the Heighway's dragon matrix about: M(Heighways's)={{1, 1, 0, 0}, {0, 1, 1, 0}, {0, 0, 1, 1}, {1, 0, 0, 1}} M(triangle)={{0, 0, 1, 1}, {0, 1, 1, 0}, {1, 1, 0, 0}, {1, 0, 0, 1}} This result is a permutation of the rows of the matrix. I have obtained three triangle sets and two Heighway's sets by experiments like these.
