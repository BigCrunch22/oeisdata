%N A105096 Length of shortest Lucas chain for n.
%C A105096 This may already be in the OEIS - the reference does not give enough terms to check. It would also be nice to give the definition here.
%C A105096 Lucas chains are addition chains with additional requirements on the presence of differences between members of the chain. Therefore a(n) >= A003313(n) and A104892(n) <= A003064(n). Shortest simple Lucas chains are constrained even further (forbid duplication between adjacent members). Therefore a(n) <= A105195(n). - _R. J. Mathar_, May 24 2008
