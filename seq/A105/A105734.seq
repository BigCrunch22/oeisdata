%N A105734 For n>2, a(n) > 0 is such that a(n-1)^2+4*a(n-2)*a(n) is a minimal square, with a(1)=1, a(2)=1.
%C A105734 The sequence depends on seed terms a(1) and a(2); if a(1)=1, a(3)=a(2)+1. All(?) sequences end with cycle={1,2,3,2,1} (or {2,4,6,4,2}, which essentially the same cycle) of length=5.
%Y A105734 Cf. A105736 - A105746.
