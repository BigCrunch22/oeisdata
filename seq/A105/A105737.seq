%N A105737 For n>2, a(n) > 0 is such that a(n-1)^2+4*a(n-2)*a(n) is a minimal square, a(1)=1,a(2)=4.
%C A105737 The sequence depends on seed terms a(1) and a(2); if a(1)=1, a(3)=a(2)+1. All(?) sequences end with cycle={1,2,3,2,1} (or {2,4,6,4,2}, which essentially the same cycle) of length=5. This particular sequence does not merge with A105734 - A105736 and ends with another cycle {2,4,6,4,2}.
%Y A105737 Cf. A105734 - A105746.
