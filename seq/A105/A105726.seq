%N A105726 Involution of nonnegative integers. A deeply recursive variant of A056539.
%C A105726 Keyword "look" refers especially to the scatterplot image by _Rémy Sigrist_, which has a strong resemblance to an FPGA architecture diagram. - _Antti Karttunen_, Dec 25 2024

%e A105726 By definition a(0)=0 and a(1)=1.
%e A105726 a(2)=2, as 2 = 10 in binary, thus its run counts are (1 1), which reversed yields the same (1 1), from which we collect a binary number 10, i.e. 2 in decimal.
%e A105726 a(4)=6, as 4 = 100 in binary, thus its run counts are (1 2), which reversed and each element mapped through a itself yields (2 1), which are run counts of binary number 110, i.e. 6 in decimal.
%e A105726 a(16)=126, as 16 = 10000 in binary, thus its run counts are (1 4), which reversed yields (4 1) and a(4)=6 and a(1)=1, thus we find that the run counts (6 1) form a binary 1111110 i.e. 126 in decimal.

%Y A105726 Differs from its "shallow" version A056539 first time at n=15, where A056539(15)=15, but here a(15)=63.
