%N A240713 Number of decompositions of 2n=p1+p2 (prime p1 <= p2), where at least one other such pair 2n=p3+p4 (prime p3 <= p4) exists such that |p1-p3|= 6 or 12.
%C A240713 It is conjectured that a(n)=0 only when n=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 16, 34, 76, 229.
%C A240713 The 2n decompositions counted in this sequence are a subset of 2n decompositions as of in Goldbach conjecture (A002375).
%C A240713 Per definition, all nonzero terms are greater than 1.

%e A240713 For n = 11, 2n=22. 22 = 3 + 19 = 5 + 17 = 11 + 11. |5-11|=6 so pair 5+17 and 11+11 are counted. So a(11)=2.
%e A240713 ...
%e A240713 For n = 17, 2n=34. 34 = 3 + 31 = 5 + 29 = 11 + 23 = 17 + 17. |5-11|=6, so 5+29 and 11+23 are counted. Also since |11-17|=6, 17+17 is also counted (where 11+23 is already counted). In case |5-17|=12, both instances are already counted. So overall three instances are found. a(17)=3.
