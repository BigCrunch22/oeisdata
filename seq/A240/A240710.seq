%N A240710 Primes p such that at least one number among p+-6 and p+-12 is also a prime.
%C A240710 The first difference between a(n) and A000040(n+2) is a(97) = 541, while A000040(99) = prime(99) = 523.
%C A240710 The union of A240709 and A240710 is the set of all prime numbers, i.e., A000040.

%e A240710 For 2, 2+-6 and 2+-12 are all even composite numbers. So 2 is excluded.
%e A240710 For 3, 3+-6 and 3+-12 are all multiples of 3. So 3 is excluded.
%e A240710 For each prime number p between 5 and 521, at least one number among p+-6 and p+-12 is a prime number, thus p is included.
%e A240710 For 523, 523 - 12 = 511 = 7*73, 523 - 6 = 517 = 11*47, 523 + 6 = 529 = 23^2, 523 + 12 = 535 = 5*107. They are all composites, so 523 is excluded.
