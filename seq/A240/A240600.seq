%N A240600 Number of partially filled hexagons in the first 120-degree circular sector of hexagonal lattice A_2 centered at deep hole along the edge of a circle also centered at the deep hole.
%C A240600 A(n) alternates between the numbers for circles which intersect points on the A2 lattice and the numbers for circles which pass in between the points on a lattice.

%e A240600 for n = 1, the squared radius is in the open interval (0,1) and the corresponding circle passes through 1 hexagon.
%e A240600 for n = 14, the squared radius is 13 with the corresponding circle passing through the furthest corner of 2 hexagons and passing through 5 hexagons.
%Y A240600 A038588 gives the number of hexagons completely encircled in all three circular sectors.
%Y A240600 Squared radii of alternate entries is given by the Loeschian numbers A003136.
%Y A240600 A234300 is the analog for the 2-d Cartesian lattice.
%Y A240600 A237708 is the analog for the 3-d Cartesian lattice.
%Y A240600 A239353 is the analog for the 4-d Cartesian lattice.
