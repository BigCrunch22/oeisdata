%N A240763 Preferential arrangements of 1, 2, 3, ... things in one-line notation, arranged lexicographically.
%C A240763 A preferential arrangement is like a permutation, except that ties are allowed. Preferential arrangements are also called ordered partitions. See A000670.
%C A240763 There are A000670(n) terms of length n.
%H A240763 N. J. A. Sloane, <a href="/A240763/b240763.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..52609</a> (lists all preferential arrangements of <= 7 things).

%e A240763 The preferential arrangement of 7 things given by
%e A240763 3=4 < 5 < 1=2=7 < 6
%e A240763 would be represented by
%e A240763 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
%e A240763 3 3 1 1 2 4 3
%e A240763 which in the compressed one-line notation is written 3311243. Obviously this compressed notation only works for fewer than 10 things. In the "human-readable" notation used in the a-file, this example would be written 34,5,127,6.
%e A240763 Thanks to _Nathaniel Shar_ for suggesting the one-line notation.
%Y A240763 Cf. A000670, A239914, A217389, A030299 (an analogous sequence for permutations).
