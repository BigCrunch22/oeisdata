%N A240087 Smallest difference to start a prime arithmetic progression of three or more terms with the n-th prime number.
%C A240087 It is conjectured that this sequence is defined for all odd prime numbers.

%F A240087 prime(n) + a(n)*k, with n >= 2, for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., kmax(n), with kmax(n) >= 2, are primes, but prime(n) - a(n) is not a prime. prime(n)= A000040(n). - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Apr 17 2014
%e A240087 n=2: the second prime number is 3; 3, 5, 7 form a 3-term prime arithmetic progression with difference 2. So a(2) = 2.
%e A240087 n=3: the third prime is 5; 5, 11, 17, 23, 29 form a 5-term prime arithmetic progression with difference 6, and this is the smallest difference to obtain three or more terms, hence a(3) = 6.
%e A240087 n=5: the fifth prime number is 11. Although 11, 17, 23, 29 form a 4-term prime arithmetic progression with difference 6, this prime arithmetic progression actually starts with 5 (see n=3). 11, 29, 47 form a 3-term prime arithmetic progression with difference 18. So a(5) = 18.
