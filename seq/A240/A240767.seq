%N A240767 Numbers n such that n^k + (n-1)^k + ... + 3^k + 2^k is prime for some natural number k.
%C A240767 a(9) > 19. See A240766 for more information.
%C A240767 a(n) is also the n-values such that A240766(n) is nonzero.
%C A240767 It is known that a(n) must be == 3 mod 4 or 0 mod 4 (except a(1) = 2) due to the parity of the sum. If an n-value is congruent to 1 mod 4 or 2 mod 4, the sum will always be even and thus, not prime.
%C A240767 It is known that 31, 36, 40, 43, 47, 56, 67, 83, and 171 are members of this sequence.
%C A240767 If n-1 is not squarefree, then n is not a member of this sequence.
%e A240767 2^k is prime for at least one k (and only one k in this instance; k = 1). Thus, 2 is a member of this sequence.
%e A240767 3^k+2^k is prime for at least one k (see A082101). Thus, 3 is a member of this sequence.
%o A240767 (PARI) a(n)=for(k=1,4000,if(ispseudoprime(sum(i=2,n,i^k)),return(k)))
%o A240767 n=1; while(n<200,if(a(n),print(a(n)));n+=1)
