%N A240972 Lexicographically earliest sequence such that (i) the binary plot of the sequence is symmetric with respect to the line y=x and (ii) the derived sequence (A000265(a(n))) contains only distinct terms.
%C A240972 The first constraint means that writing the binary representation of each number vertically yields a symmetrical plot about the line y = x (see the binary plot).
%C A240972 The second constraint ensures that the sequence contains only distinct terms, and differs from A000079.
%C A240972 The keywords "nice" and "look" are based on the fact that the binary plot is very interesting. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 22 2014
