%e A240692 For n = 1, a(1) = 4, the squared distance to the corners furthest from the deep hole of three hexagons which share the deep hole as a corner.
%e A240692 For n= 3, a(3) = 13, the squared distance to the furthest corners of the 6 hexagons third most distant from the deep hole - which, when added to the 3 that are closest and the 3 that are second-closest, yields a total of 12, which is A038588(3).
%Y A240692 A038588(n) gives the corresponding cluster size starting at n = 1 (the first positive radius circle);
%Y A240692 A000404 is the analog for a Cartesian lattice.
