%N A240227 All even positive integers which have at least one 'balanced' representation as a sum of three distinct nonzero squares.
%C A240227 For the numbers with representations as a sum of three distinct nonzero squares see A004432. For their multiplicity see A025442.
%C A240227 Here only even numbers are considered, and a representation 2*m = a^2 + b^2 + c^2,  a > b > c > 0 denoted by the  triple (a,b,c), is called 'balanced' if a = b + c. E.g., 62 is represented by (6, 5, 1) and (7, 3, 2) but only (6, 5, 1) is balanced because 6 = 5 + 1.
%C A240227 The multiplicities are given in A240228.
%C A240227 These numbers a(n) play a role in the problem proposed in A236300: Find all numbers which are of the form (x + y + z)*(u^2 + v^2 + w^2)/2,  x >= y >= z >= 0, where u = x-y, v = x-z, w = y-z, with u >= 0, v >=0, w >= 0, u - v + w = 0  and even u^2 + v^2 + w^2 >= 4. The special case (called in a comment on A236300 case (iib)) with distinct u, v, and w, each >=1, needs the numbers a(n) of the present sequence. If the triple is taken as (u, u+w, w) with u < w then the [x, y, z] values are [2*u+w, u+w, u] and the number from A236300 is (2*u+w)*(u^2 + w^2 + u*w) =(2*u+w)*a(n). If this number from A236300 has multiplicity  A240228(n) >=2 then there are A240228(n) different values for [x, y, z] and corresponding different A236300 numbers.
