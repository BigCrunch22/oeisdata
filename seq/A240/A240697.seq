%N A240697 The smallest p2-p1 when 2n = p1+p4 = p2+p3, where p1 < p2 <= p3 < p4 are prime numbers.
%C A240697 a(n) is defined as 0 when 2n cannot be written as the sum of two prime numbers in two or more distinct ways.
%C A240697 Note that there are only two values of this sequence that are greater than 12 for n<=10000, which are a(34)=24 and a(229)=18.
%C A240697 From testing up to n=300000, it appears that only limited terms take a value other than 2, 4, or 6.  Here is a list:
%C A240697 a(n) = 0 for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6;
%C A240697 a(n) = 10 for n = 16, 76, and 181;
%C A240697 a(n) = 12 for n = 19, 31, 44, 64, 79, 86, 124, 139, 259, 269, 274, 314, 391, 404, 484, 499, 604, 619, 691, 709, 859, 1054, 1129, 1399, 1469, 1559, 1574, 2729, 4006, and 5804;
%C A240697 a(229) = 18; and a(34) = 24.
%C A240697 Conjecture: except for those listed above, no terms in this sequence take a value other than 2, 4, or 6.

%e A240697 When n<5, 2n cannot be written as the sum of two prime numbers in two distinct ways, so a(1) = a(2) = a(3) = a(4) = 0.
%e A240697 When n=5, 2n=10 = 3+7 = 5+5, 5-3=2, so a(5)=2.
%e A240697 ...
%e A240697 When n=18, 2n=36 = 5+31 = 7+29 = 13+23 = 17+19. The smallest difference among the four numbers {5,7,13,17} is 2 = 7-5. So a(18)=2.
