%N A240967 Numbers that end in (..., 128, 128, 128, ...) under the rule: next term = product of the last four digits in the sequence so far.
%C A240967 Additional rule: If there are fewer than k=4 digits in the sequence so far, then it is "extended to the left" with the first digit (i.e., that digit is repeated as often as necessary).
%C A240967 Apart from the trivial cycles (0) (cf. A239616) and (1) (entered for initial values 1 or 11 or 111 or 1111+x*10^5) and the cycle (128) considered here, the rule also allows the "constant" cycles (175) and (384), cf. A239721-A239722. These seem to be the only cycles allowed for this rule.
%C A240967 See A238984 for further information, including a link to Eric Angelini's SeqFan post motivating this sequence.
%o A240967 (PARI) is(n) = A238984(99,n,4)==128 \\ The "99" here should be large enough to reach the cycle (128) for small initial values n. It might be necessary to increase this value in other cases.
%Y A240967 Cf. A238984, A239419, A239616, A239721, A239722.
