%N A240911 Smallest number greater than a(n-1) divisible by smallest number that is not a divisor of a(n-1).
%C A240911 Conjecture: Numbers that are not in this sequence below any finite limit will never outnumber numbers that are.
%C A240911 That is, a(n) < 2n for all n. This holds for n < 10^10. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Apr 14 2014
%C A240911 The expected value of the first differences of this sequence is Sum_{q>=2} q*(p-1)/(2*lcm(2,...,q)) as q = p^k ranges over the prime powers, or approximately 1.39389022808623327303..., so the conjecture is very likely to be true. - _Charlie Neder_, Apr 26 2019

%e A240911 a(5) cannot be 5 because smallest number that is not a divisor of 4 is 3 and 3 is not a divisor of 5.
