%N A240908 The sequency numbers of the 8 rows of a version of the Hadamard-Walsh matrix of order 8.
%C A240908 The Hadamard (Hadamard-Walsh) matrix is widely used in telecommunications and signal analysis. It has 3 well-known forms which vary according to the sequency ordering of its rows: "natural" ordering, "dyadic" or Payley ordering, and sequency ordering.  In a mathematical context the sequency is the number of zero crossings or transitions in a matrix row (although in a physical signal context, it is half the number of zero crossings per time period). The matrix row sequencies are a permutation of the set [0,1,2,...n-1], where n is the order of the matrix. For spectral analysis of signals the sequency-ordered form is needed. Unlike the dyadic ordering (given by A153141), the natural ordering requires a separate list for each matrix order. This sequence is the natural sequency ordering for an order 8 matrix.
