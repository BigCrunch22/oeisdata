%N A356683 a(n) is the smallest positive k such that the count of squarefree numbers <= k that have n prime factors is equal to the count of squarefree numbers <= k that have n-1 prime factors (and the count is positive).
%e A356683 The first two squarefree numbers are 1 and 2; 1 has 0 prime factors and 2 has 1 prime factor, so a(1)=2.
%e A356683 At k=39, in the interval [1..k], there are 12 squarefree numbers with 1 prime factor (i.e., 12 primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37), and 12 squarefree numbers with 2 prime factors (i.e., 6, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 26, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39). k=39 is the smallest such positive number for which these two counts are the same (and are positive), so a(2)=39.
%e A356683 At k=1279786, the interval [1..k] includes 265549 squarefree numbers with 2 prime factors and the same number of squarefree numbers with 3 prime factors, and there is no smaller positive number k that has this property (where the counts are positive), so a(3)=1279786. There are 75 numbers with this property, the last one being 1281378.
%e A356683 At k=8377774397163159586, the interval [1..k] includes 1356557942402075858 squarefree numbers with 3 prime factors and the same number of squarefree numbers with 4 prime factors, and there is no smaller positive number k that has this property (where the counts are positive), so a(4)=8377774397163159586. There are 14 numbers with this property, the last one being 8377774397163162544. - _Henri Lifchitz_, Jan 31 2025
