%N A356988 a(n) = n - a^[2](n - a^[3](n-1)) with a(1) = 1, where a^[2](n) = a(a(n)) and a^[3](n) = a(a(a(n))).
%C A356988 This is the second sequence in a family of nested-recurrent sequences with apparently similar structure defined as follows. Given a sequence s = {s(n) : n >= 1} we define the k-th iterated sequence s^[k] by putting s^[1](n) = s(n) and setting s^[k](n) = s^[k-1](s(n)) for k >= 2. For k >= 1, we define a nested-recurrent sequence, dependent on k, by putting u(1) = 1 and setting u(n) = n - u^[k](n - u^[k+1](n-1)) for n >= 2. This is the case k = 2. For other cases see A006165 (k = 1), A356989 (k = 3) and A356990 (k = 4).
%C A356988 The sequence is slow, that is, for n >= 1, a(n+1) - a(n) is either 0 or 1. The sequence is unbounded.
%C A356988 The line graph of the sequence {a(n)} thus consists of a series of plateaus (where the value of the ordinate a(n) remains constant as n increases) joined by lines of slope 1.
%C A356988 The sequence of plateau heights begins 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ..., the Fibonacci numbers A000045.
%C A356988 The plateaus start at abscissa values n = 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, ..., the Lucas numbers A000032, and finish at abscissa values n = 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ..., the Fibonacci numbers. The sequence of plateau lengths 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... is thus the Fibonacci sequence.
%C A356988 The iterated sequences{a^[k](n) : n >= 1}, k = 2, 3,..., share similar properties to the present sequence. See the Example section below.

%F A356988 a(n+1) - a(n) = 0 or 1.
%F A356988 The terms of the sequence are completely determined by the following two results:
%F A356988 a) for n >= 2, a(L(n-1) + j) = F(n) for 0 <= j <= F(n-3), where F(n) = A000045(n), the n-th Fibonacci number with F(-1) = 1 and L(n) = A000032(n), the n-th Lucas number;
%F A356988 b) for n >= 2, a(F(n+1) + j) = F(n) + j for 0 <= j <= F(n-1).
%F A356988 Hence a(F(n+2)) = a(F(n+1)) + a(F(n)) for n >= 2 and a(L(n+2)) = a(L(n+1)) + a(L(n)) for n >= 0.
%F A356988 a(2*F(n)) = Lucas(n-1) for n >= 2;
%F A356988 a(3*F(n)) = 2*F(n) for n >= 1;
%F A356988 a(4*F(n)) = F(n+2) for n >= 2;
%F A356988 a(5*F(n)) = 4*F(n) - F(n-1) = A022120(n-2) for n >= 2.
%F A356988 a(2*L(n)) = F(n) + 3*F(n-1) = A104449(n) for n >= 0;
%F A356988 a(3*L(n)) = F(n+3) for n >= 3;
%F A356988 a(4*L(n)) = F(n+4) - L(n-3) = A022114(n-1) for n >= 3;
%F A356988 a(5*L(n)) = 11*F(n-1) + F(n-4) = A022367(n-1) for n >= 4.
%F A356988 For n >= 1, m >= 2, a(F(m*n)) = F(m*n-1) and a(L(m*n)) = F(m*n+1). Hence
%F A356988 a(L(m*n)) + a(F(m*n)) = L(m*n) and a(L(m*n)) - a(F(m*n)) = F(m*n).
%F A356988 Conjectures:
%F A356988 1) a(n) + a^[2](n - a^[2](n - a^[2](n))) = n for n >= 2.
%F A356988 2) If k >= 2 and  m = 2*k - 1 then a(m*n - a(k*n)) = a(m*n - a(m*n - a(m*n - a(k*n)))).
%e A356988 Related sequences:
%e A356988 1) The square of the sequence: {a^[2](n) : n >= 1} = {a(a(n)) : n >= 1}. The first few terms are
