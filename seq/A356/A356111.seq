%N A356111 The number of 1+1+1-free ordered posets of [n].
%C A356111 A partial order R on [n] is ordered if xRy implies x < y; i.e., the natural order (<) is a linear extension of R. 1+1+1-free posets are those with width (longest antichain) at most 2.
%e A356111 The six 1+1+1-free ordered posets of [3] are those with covering relations {(1,2)}, {(1,3)}, {(2,3)}, {(1,2), (1,3)}, {(1,2), (2,3)} and {(1,3), (2,3)}.
%Y A356111 See A006455 for the number of all ordered posets on [n], and A135922 for the number of ordered posets on [n] with height at most two.
