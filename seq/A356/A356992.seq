%N A356992 Then a(n) = n - b(n - b(n - b(n - b(n - b(n - b(n)))))) for n >= 2, where b(n) = A356988(n).
%C A356992 The sequence is slow, that is, for n >= 2, a(n+1) - a(n) is either 0 or 1. The sequence is unbounded.
%C A356992 The line graph of the sequence {a(n)} thus consists of a series of plateaus (where the value of the ordinate a(n) remains constant as n increases) joined by lines of slope 1.
%C A356992 The sequence of plateau heights begins 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, ..., conjecturally the Lucas sequence {A000032(k): k >= 3}.
%C A356992 The plateaus start at abscissa values n = 5, 10, 16, 26, 42, 68, .... Apart from the first term 5, this appears to be the sequence {2*Fibonacci(k): k >= 5}.
%C A356992 The plateaus end at abscissa values n = 7, 12, 19, 31, 50, 81, ..., conjecturally the sequence {A013655(k): k >= 3}.
%C A356992 The sequence of plateau lengths begins 2, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, .... Apart from the first term 2, this appears to be the sequence {Fibonacci(k): k >= 3}.
%C A356992 The slow sequences {a(a(n)): n >= 3} and {a(a(a(n))): n >= 4} appear to have similar properties to the present sequence. The slow sequence {n - a(n): n >= 2} appears to have plateaus at heights given by the Fibonacci sequence. See the Example section.
