%N A356078 Highly composite numbers that are multiples of their number of divisors.
%C A356078 Conjecture: this sequence is finite. The prime factorization of the number of divisors of a large highly composite number usually has a high power of 2; this is not true of the number of divisors of a highly composite number itself.
%e A356078 180 (in A002182) has 18 divisors, and 180/18 equals 10; so, 180 is in this sequence.
