%N A356831 Size of the automorphism group for the underlying graph of the divisibility graph of size n.
%C A356831 Define a graph H_n with the natural numbers 1,2,...,n as vertices and edges as follows: For any two vertices, v_1, v_2, there is an edge between v_1 and v_2 if there exists a natural number m > 1 such that v_1 = m * v_2. Thus an edge exists between v_1 and v_2 if v_2 divides v_1. a(n) is the size of the automorphism group on the vertices of H_n.
%C A356831 The first few terms (10) are easy to check on paper. For larger values the implementation of BLISS in the R package igraph was used.
