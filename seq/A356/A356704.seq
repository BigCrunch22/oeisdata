%N A356704 a(n) is the least k such that Mordell's equation y^2 = x^3 + k^3 has exactly 2*n+1 integral solutions.
%C A356704 a(n) is the least k such that y^2 = x^3 + k^3 has exactly n solutions with y positive, or exactly n+1 solutions with y nonnegative.
%C A356704 a(n) is the smallest index of 2*n+1 in A356706, of n in A356707, and of n+1 in A356708.
%F A356704 a(n) = A179162(2*n+1)^(1/3).
%e A356704 a(4) = 8 since y^2 = x^3 + 8^3 has exactly 9 solutions (-8,0), (-7,+-13), (4,+-24), (8,+-32), and (184,+-2496), and the number of solutions to y^2 = x^3 + k^3 is not 9 for 0 < k < 8.
