%F A356135 a(n) = A001358(A106131(n)).
%e A356135 The 1st semiprime is 4, which is congruent to 6 (mod 1), so 4 is in the sequence.
%e A356135 The 2nd semiprime is 6, which is congruent to 6 (mod 2), so 6 is in the sequence.
%e A356135 The 3rd semiprime is 9, which is congruent to 6 (mod 3), so 9 is in the sequence.
%e A356135 The 4th semiprime is 10, which is congruent to 6 (mod 4), so 10 is in the sequence.
%e A356135 The 5th semiprime is 14, which is not congruent to 6 (mod 5), so 14 is not in the sequence.
