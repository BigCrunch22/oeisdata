%N A356375 Number of unlabeled centered trees with n nodes that have exactly one diametral path (up to direction of traversal).
%C A356375 A diametral path in a tree is a path of maximum length. A diametral path in a centered tree is necessarily of even length.  Its endpoints are leaves and its middle point is the center of the tree.  A centered tree with exactly one diametral path of length 2m can be decomposed into a rooted tree of height at most m-1 along with exactly 2 rooted trees of height exactly m-1.  It appears that almost all centered trees (A000676) have exactly one diametral path.
