%N A356415 a(n) is the least start of exactly n consecutive numbers that have an equal number of even and odd exponents in their prime factorization (A187039), or -1 if no such run of consecutive numbers exists.
%C A356415 a(6) > 6.5*10^10, if it exist.
%e A356415 a(2) = 44 since 44 = 2^2 * 11 and 45 = 3^2 * 5 both have one even and one odd exponent in their prime factorization, 43 and 46 have no even exponent, and 44 is the least number with this property.
