%N A356977 a(n) is the number of solutions, j >= 0 and 2 <= m_1 <= ... <= m_n, of the equation Sum_{k=1..n} F(m_k) = 2^j where F(i) is the i-th Fibonacci number.
%C A356977 The difficulty of this sequence comes in determining which is the largest j in a solution for a(n), equivalently the last nonzero term in each sum from the A319394-based formula in the formula section.
%C A356977 a(2) derives from Bravo and Luca, a(3) from Bravo and Bravo, a(4) from Pagdame Tiebekabe and Diouf. Pagdame has indicated A356928(5), from which a(5) is derived, has been determined.
%C A356977 a(6) >= 178, a(7) >= 478.

%F A356977 a(n) = Sum_{i >= 0} A319394(2^i, k).
%e A356977 For n = 2, the a(2) = 6 solutions are j = 1 with (2,2), j = 2 with (2,4) and (3,3), j = 3 with (4,5), j = 4 with (4,7) and (6,6) according to the paper of Bravo and Luca. [That is, 2 = 1+1, 4 = 1+3 = 2+2, 8 = 3+5, 16 = 3+13 = 8+8.]
