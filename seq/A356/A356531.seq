%N A356531 Primes p == 1 (mod 23) which are norms of elements in the 23rd cyclotomic field.
%C A356531 Primes which are norms of principal ideals in the 23rd cyclotomic ring of integers.
%C A356531 The class number of the 23rd cyclotomic field is 3, so about 1/3 of primes == 1 (mod 23) should be norms of principal ideals.
%C A356531 Is it true that a(n) == 1 (mod 46)? - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Aug 13 2022
