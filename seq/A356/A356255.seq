%N A356255 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest magnitude number not occurring earlier such that n is divisible by s = Sum_{k = 1..n} a(k), where |s| > 1.
%C A356255 The sequence is finite - after 2020 terms, a(2020) = -669, the sum of all terms is 4 so the next term would have to be 4 less than the divisors with magnitude > 1 of 2021, namely 2017, 43, 39, -47, -51, -2025. However these six numbers have all previously occurred so the sequence terminates.

%e A356255 a(7) = 4 as Sum_{k = 1..7} a(k) = 1 - 3 - 1 + 5 + 3 - 2 + 4 = 7, and 4 is the smallest magnitude number not occurring earlier that forms a sum with magnitude > 1 that is a divisor of 7.
