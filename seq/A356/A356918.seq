%N A356918 Triangle read by rows where T(n,k) is Colijn and Plazzotta's distance metric d_1(n,k) between rooted binary tree numbers n and k, for 1 <= k <= n.
%C A356918 T(n,k) is the cardinality of the multiset symmetric difference ("XOR") between the subtree numbers in tree n, and in k, those being rows n and k of A356917.
%C A356918 A multiset symmetric difference discards copies of elements common to both sets, and keeps the excess copies which one of the multisets has over the other.
%C A356918 Equivalently, T(n,k) is the multi-dimensional Manhattan distance between vectors v_n and v_k where vector element v_t(s) is the number of occurrences of subtree number s in tree t.
%C A356918 Column k=1 it the distance to the singleton, which is a single subtree 1, so that T(n,1) = A064002(n) - 1 is the number of vertices of n except one 1.
%C A356918 The main diagonal is T(n,n) = 0 which is distance 0 between n and itself.
%C A356918 As a flat sequence, a(m) is distance d_1 between the two child subtrees of the root in tree number m+1.

%F A356918 T(n,k) = Sum_{s = subtree numbers in n or k} abs(v_n(s) - v_k(s)) where v_t(s) is the number of times s occurs in row t of A356917.
