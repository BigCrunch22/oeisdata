%N A356676 A certain morphism applied to A007814 that is related to the lexicographically least infinite squarefree words over the nonnegative integers.
%C A356676 This sequence is the result of applying the morphism alpha to the ruler sequence, A007814. The morphism alpha is defined so that alpha(0) is a particular 3226-letter word, alpha(1) is a particular 3186-letter word, and for n>=2, alpha(n) is defined recursively and has length 2*len(alpha(n-1))+2^(n+4)+10.
%C A356676 A full definition of the morphism alpha can be found in the linked Python code.
%C A356676 This is an infinite suffix of A356677. Applying the ruler morphism n->0(n+1) once results in an infinite suffix of A356679 and of the lexicographically least infinite squarefree word over the nonnegative integers beginning with k for each k>=3.
