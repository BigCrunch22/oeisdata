%N A356431 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number not occurring earlier that shares a factor with both a(n-1) and the number of divisors of a(n-1).
%C A356431 The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers although it may take a large number of terms for the primes to appear, e.g., 17 has not occurred after 100000 terms. In the same range the only fixed points are the first two terms; it is likely no more exist although this is unknown.
%H A356431 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A356431/a356431.png">Image of the first 100000 terms</a>. The green line is y = n.
%e A356431 a(8) = 3 as a(7) = 12 which has six divisors, and 3 is the smallest unused number that shares a factor with both 12 and 6.
