%N A356824 Palindromes that can be written as the sum of two palindromic primes.
%C A356824 With the exception of 22, which is the sum of 11 and 11, no term of this sequence has an even number of digits. Proof: Other than 11, palindromes with an even number of digits are not primes (since they are divisible by 11). Suppose m is a term of this sequence with 2k digits. Then m must be the sum of two palindromic primes p and q with 2k-1 digits each. It follows that the first and the last digit of m is 1. Hence, either p or q is even, creating a contradiction with primality.
%C A356824 With the exception of 5, 7, and 9, all terms of this sequence are even. Proof: two consecutive multi-digit palindromes differ by at least 10, so larger palindromes can't be the sum of a palindromic prime and 2. Thus, each multi-digit term is the sum of two odd numbers.
%e A356824 282 can be written as the sum of two prime palindromes, 101 and 181. Thus, 282 is in the sequence.
