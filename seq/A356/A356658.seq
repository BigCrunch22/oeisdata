%N A356658 The number of orderings of the hypercube Q_n whose disorder number is equal to the disorder number of Q_n.
%C A356658 A proof of a closed form for this sequence will settle Question 3.3 of the preprint "The disorder number of a graph" (see links).

%e A356658 For n = 2, there are exactly two orderings that begin at 00, whose disorder is the disorder number of Q_2, namely, [00, 11, 01, 10] and [00, 11, 10, 01]. Since we can start at any vertex, we need to multiply their number by 2^2, yielding a(2) = 8.
