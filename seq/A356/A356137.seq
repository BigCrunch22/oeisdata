%N A356137 Positive integers m such that the fractional part of the geometric mean of the sequence s(m) does not exceed the fractional part of the arithmetic mean of s(m), where s(m) is the sequence 1 + 1/1, 2 + 1/2, ..., m + 1/m.
%C A356137 The idea is to take note of when the fractional parts of the geometric mean and arithmetic mean "follow suit" with respect to the celebrated geometric mean <= arithmetic mean inequality.

%e A356137 2 is a term because the geometric mean of 1 + 1/1 and 2 + 1/2 is the geometric mean of 2 and 2.5, which is a bit less than 2.24, whereas the arithmetic mean of 2 and 2.5 is 2.25, and 0.24 <= 0.25.
%e A356137 4 is not a term because the geometric mean is 2.90..., whereas the arithmetic mean is 3.02..., and 0.90 > 0.02.
