%N A356720 Numbers k such that Mordell's equation y^2 = x^3 + k^3 has more than 1 integral solution.
%C A356720 Numbers k such that Mordell's equation y^2 = x^3 + k^3 has solutions other than the trivial solution (-k,0).
%C A356720 Different from A103254, which lists k such that Mordell's equation y^2 = x^3 + k^3 has solutions with positive x (or equivalently, with nonnegative x). 71, 74, and 155 are here but not in A103254.
%C A356720 Cube root of A356703.
%C A356720 Contains all squares since A356711 does.
