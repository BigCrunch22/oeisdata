%N A356946 Number of stable digits of the integer tetration n^^n (i.e., maximum nonnegative integer m such that n^^n is congruent modulo 10^m to n^^(n + 1)).
%C A356946 a(10) = 10^^9 is too large to include. In general, if n is a multiple of 10, then a(n) is given by the number of trailing zeros that appear at the end of n^^n.
%C A356946 This follows from the constancy of the "congruence speed" (AKA "convergence speed" here on the OEIS) of hyper-3 for any exponentiation base which is a multiple of 10, otherwise the congruence speed is constant only for hyper-4 and it is strictly positive for any tetration base n >= 1 that is not a multiple of 10 (for an explicit formula to calculate a(n) for any n, see the linked paper entitled "Number of stable digits of any integer tetration").

%e A356946 For n = 3, 3^3^3 is congruent to 3^3^3^3 (mod 10^2) and 3^3^3 is not congruent to 3^3^3^3 (mod 10^3). Thus, a(3) = 2.
