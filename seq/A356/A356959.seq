%N A356959 Number of length-n binary strings that can be infinitely extended to the right to form an overlap-free string.
%C A356959 A binary string is overlap-free if it contains no block of the form axaxa, where a in {0,1} and x a possibly empty string.

%e A356959 For example, 010011001011010010 is infinitely extendable to the right, but 010011001011010011 is not (every extension by a word of length 7 gives an overlap).
