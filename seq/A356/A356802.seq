%N A356802 A refinement of the Mahonian numbers (non-canonical ordering).
%C A356802 Let T(N,d) be a Mahonian number.
%C A356802 (1) Find all partitions k(1) >= k(2) >= ... >= k(N) = 0 of the number d with at most N-1 parts, such that k(i) - k(i+1) <= 1 and k(N) = 0.
%C A356802 (2) For each such partition, draw a ribbon Young diagram with N boxes at matrix (row-column) coordinates (k(i), k(i) + i - 1), i = 1, ..., N.
%C A356802 (3) For each ribbon diagram, count all standard Young skew tableaux.
%C A356802 The numbers under (3) will add up to T(N,d), as proven in the cited reference. These refinements appear consecutively as subsequences in the sequence, ordered by increasing N and increasing d from 0 to N(N-1)/2 for each N. The ordering within each subsequence is reverse-lexicographic by the partitions (1), i.e., from the largest k(1) down.
%C A356802 This ordering corresponds to the ordering of generating polynomials from the lowest power in d up, and from the highest power in k(1) down. Because of certain symmetries in the sequence (cf. the example), it is the same as decreasing d from N(N-1)/2 to 0 and ordering the partitions lexicographically. For the converse (canonical) convention and a program implementation, cf. A357611.
%C A356802 The sums of rows (3) are A008302. Because the latter is itself a triangle, arranged in the (N, d) plane, the present sequence is actually three-dimensional: each number in the triangle A008302 can be replaced by the row numbers (3), each of which is thus coordinatized by (N, d, m), the last coordinate being its position in the row.
%C A356802 The range of the m coordinate is the number of partitions satisfying the constraint (1). It is proven in the cited reference to be equal to the coefficient of q^d in the q-binomial theorem: coeff[q^d] Product_{k=1..N-1} (1 + q^k).

%e A356802 The first nontrivial terms in the sequence are a(11) = a(12) = 3, corresponding to the refinement T(4, 3) = 6 = 3 + 3. The terms from a(1) to a(10) are the Mahonian numbers themselves, because the refinement is trivial for them (there is only one partition satisfying the given constraints).
