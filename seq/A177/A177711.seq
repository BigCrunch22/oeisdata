%N A177711 Natural numbers which are not sums of one or more distinct primorials.
%F A177711 COMPLEMENT of {Primorial numbers A002110 UNION A177689 Sums of 2 distinct primorials UNION Sums of 3 distinct primorials A177697 UNION Sums of 4 distinct primorials A177709 UNION ...}.
%e A177711 1 and 2 are not in the sequence, as they are the first and second primorials, 0# and 1#. 3 is not in the sequence, as 3 = 1+2. Neither 4 nor 5 can be the sum of distinct primorials (i.e. 4=2+2 or 5 = 2+2+1 repeat a primorial). 6 is not in the sequence, as it is 3#. 7 and 8 are not in the sequence as 7 = 6+1 and 8 = 6+2. 9 is not in the sequence, as 9 = 6+2+1.
