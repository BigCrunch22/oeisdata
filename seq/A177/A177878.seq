%N A177878 Triangle in which row n is generated from (1,2,3,...,n) dot (n, n-1,...,1) with subtractive carryovers.
%C A177878 The subtractive carryover dot product of two vectors (a(1),a(2),...,a(n)) dot (b(1),b(2),...,b(n)) = (c(1),...,c(n)) is defined by c(1) = a(1)*b(1) and c(i) = a(i)*b(i)-c(i-1), i>1.
%C A177878 A177877 = analogous triangle with additive carryovers.
%C A177878 A160770 = the analogous triangle using the triangular series as the generating vector.
%F A177878 By rows, dot product of (1,2,3,...) and (...3,2,1) with subtractive carryovers; such that current row product subtracts previous product.
%e A177878 Row 3 = (4, 2, 4, 0) = (1, 2, 3, 4) dot (4, 3, 2, 1) with subtractive carryovers = (4), then (2*3 - 4 = 2), (3*2 - 2 = 4), and (4*1 - 4 = 0).
