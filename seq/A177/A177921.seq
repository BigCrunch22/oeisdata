%N A177921 Number of oval-partitions of the regular 2n-gon {2n}.
%C A177921 For each n there is a list of floor(n/2) rhombs, a four sided parallelogram with principal index a number from {1, 2, ..., floor(n/2)}. Such rhombs can tile an (n, k)-oval. An (n, k)-oval is a centro-symmetric polygon with 2k sides and contains k(k-1)/2 rhombs.  The regular 2n-gon {2n} with 2n sides is an (n,n)-oval. Its rhombs can be partitioned into (n, k)-ovals for various values of k. This partition is called an oval-partition of {2n}. Here, a(n) is the number of oval-partitions of {2n}.
