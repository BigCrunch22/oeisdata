%N A177877 Triangle in which row n is derived from (1,2,3,...,n) dot (n,n-1,...,1) with additive carryovers.
%C A177877 Carryovers (additive) are defined as "add current product to next product". For example: (1,2,3) dot (3,2,1) with carryovers = ((1*3=3), (2*2+3=7), (3*1+7=10)), so row 2 = (3, 7, 10).
%F A177877 By rows, (1,2,3,...) dot (...3,2,1); add current product to next product.
%F A177877 As an array, row 0 = the tetrahedral numbers, (1, 4, 10, 20, 35,...). n-th row adds n*(1, 3, 6, 10, 15,...) termwise.
%e A177877 Row 2 = (3, 7, 10) = (1, 2, 3) dot (3, 2, 1) with carryovers, thus: (3 = 1*3; 7 = 2*2 + 3; 10 = 3*1 + 7).
%e A177877 First few rows of the array:
%e A177877   1,   4,  10,  20,  35,...

%e A177877   3,  10,  22,  40,  65,...
%e A177877   ...
%e A177877 Example: row 1 is obtained by adding (1, 3, 6, 10, 15,...) termwise to (1, 4, 10, 20, 35,...).
