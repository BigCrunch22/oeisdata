%N A177800 The maximal length of the chain of consecutive primes starting with A177798(n) such that all of them are odious.
%C A177800 In contrast to sequence of all positive integers, where the length of a chain of consecutive odious numbers cannot exceed 2, we conjecture that over primes the length is not bounded.
%Y A177800 Cf. A000069 (odious numbers), A177798, A177748, A001969, A027697, A027699.
