%N A177263 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of permutations of {1,2,...,n} having k as the last entry in the first block (1<=k<=n). A block of a permutation is a maximal sequence of consecutive integers which appear in consecutive positions. For example, the permutation 45123867 has 4 blocks: 45, 123, 8, and 67.
%C A177263 Sum of entries in row n is n!.
%C A177263 Mirror image of A177264.
%C A177263 T(n,1)=A094304(n).

%e A177263 T(4,2)=5 because we have 12-4-3, 2-1-34, 2-1-4-3, 2-4-1-3, and 2-4-3-1 (the blocks are separated by dashes).
