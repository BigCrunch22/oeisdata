%N A177689 Sums of 2 distinct primorials.
%C A177689 This is to numbers that are the sum of 2 different primes (A038609) as primorials (A002110) are to primes (A000040). The subsequence of primes among these sums of 2 distinct primorials is the sequence of primorial primes (A018239) which is the same as the subsequence of primes among the Euclid numbers (A006862).
%F A177689 {a(n)} = {A002110(i) + A002110(j) for i =/= j}.
%Y A177689 Cf. A000040, A002110, A006862, A038609.
