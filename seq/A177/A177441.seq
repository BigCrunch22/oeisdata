%N A177441 Partial sums of A014597.
%C A177441 Partial sums of numbers n such that n^2 is a sum of distinct factorials. The subsequence of primes in this partial sum begins: 59, 659, 1187707. If there is a larger value (the sequence might be finite), a(n)^2 must be greater than 48! (about 1.24139 * 10^61).
%F A177441 a(n) = SUM[i=1..n] A014597(i) = SUM[i=1..n] {i such that i^2 is a sum of distinct factorials} = SUM[i=1..n] {i such that i^2 is a sum of distinct A000142(j)}.
