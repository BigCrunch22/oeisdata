%N A177858 Triangle in which row n gives the number of primes <= 2^n having k 1's in their binary representation, k=1..n.
%C A177858 Every row begins with 1 because 2 is the only prime having one 1 in its binary representation. A row ends in 1 or 0, depending on whether 2^n-1 is prime or composite. The sum of terms in row n is A007053(n).
