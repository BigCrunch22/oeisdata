%N A177458 The number of positive integers m for which the exponents of prime(n) and prime(n+1) in the prime power factorization of m! are both powers of 2.
%C A177458 This gives the number of rows in A115627 for which the n-th and (n+1)st column are both in {1,2,4,8,16,..}.
%C A177458 For n=2 the corresponding value is not known and >=25; moreover, we do not know if this value is finite.
%C A177458 A more general result concerning the cases for non-adjacent primes and a finite search interval for the values of m is in the 2007 publication.

%e A177458 For n=3, the 9 values of m are 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 20.
%e A177458 m=6, for example, is not counted because 6!=2^4*3^2*5 does not contain prime(4)=7.
%e A177458 m=15, for example, is not counted because 15!=2^11*3^6*5^3*7^2*11*13 contains a third power of prime(3)=5.
