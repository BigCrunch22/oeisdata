%N A177505 Base 2i representation of n reinterpreted in base 4.
%C A177505 The use of negabinary dispenses with the need for sign bits and for keeping track of signed and unsigned data types. Similarly, the use of base 2i, or quater-imaginary, dispenses with the need to represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number separately. (The term "quater-imaginary" appears in Knuth's landmark book on computer programming).
%C A177505 Quater-imaginary, based on the powers of 2i (twice the imaginary unit), uses the digits 0, 1, 2, 3. For purely real positive integers, the quater-imaginary representation is the same as negaquartal (base -4) except that 0's are "riffled" in, corresponding to the odd-indexed powers of 2i which are purely imaginary numbers. Therefore, to obtain the base 2i representations of positive real numbers, the algorithm for base -4 representations can be employed with only a small adjustment.
%C A177505 To obtain the base 2i representation of a complex number a+bi, do as above for the real part, then again for the real part of 2i*(a+bi) = -2b+2ai, giving the digits corresponding to the odd-indexed powers of 2i. - _Daniel Forgues_, May 18 2012

%F A177505 Conjectures from _Colin Barker_, Jul 16 2019: (Start)
%F A177505 G.f.: x*(1 + x + x^2 + 301*x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 - 19*x^7 + x^8 + x^9 + x^10 - 19*x^11 + x^12 + x^13 + x^14 - 19*x^15) / ((1 - x)^2*(1 + x)*(1 + x^2)*(1 + x^4)*(1 + x^8)).
%F A177505 a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-16) - a(n-17) for n>16.
%F A177505 (End)
%e A177505 a(5) = 305 because 5 in base 2i is 10301 ( = (2i)^4 + 3 * (2i)^2 + (2i)^0), and (-4)^4 + 3 * (-4)^2 + (-4)^0 = 256 + 3 * 16 + 1 = 305.
