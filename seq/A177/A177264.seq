%N A177264 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of permutations of {1,2,...,n} having k as the first entry in the last block (1<=k<=n). A block of a permutation is a maximal sequence of consecutive integers which appear in consecutive positions. For example, the permutation 45123867 has 4 blocks: 45, 123, 8, and 67.
%C A177264 Sum of entries in row n is n!.
%C A177264 Mirror image of A177263.
%C A177264 T(n,1)=A003422(n).

%F A177264 T(n,k)=(n-1)!-(k-2)! if 2<=k<=n; T(n,1)=0!+1!+...+(n-1)!.
%e A177264 T(4,3)=5 because we have 12-4-3, 2-1-34, 2-1-4-3, 2-4-1-3, and 4-2-1-3 (the blocks are separated by dashes).
