%N A138752 Number of iterations before prime(n) reaches 7 or 2 under x -> A007918(A138750(x)).
%C A138752 As explained in A138751, the map x->A007918(A138750(x)) is a natural generalization of the Collatz map to primes.
%C A138752 The only even prime p=2 is the only fixed point of this map, and all odd primes seem to end up in the loop 7 -> 17 -> 11 -> 7, after a number of steps given in the present sequence.
%C A138752 (It might have been more natural to count the steps until a number is reached for the second time. Depending on which number among {2,7,11,17} is reached first, this would increase the value of a(n) by 1,3,2 resp. 1.)

%e A138752 a(1)=a(4)=0 since prime(1)=2 and prime(4)=7 are by definition the values at which counting ends.
%e A138752 a(primepi(4499221))=63337 according to G. Brougnard, cf. Link.
