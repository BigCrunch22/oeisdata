%N A138366 Count of post-period decimal digits up to which the rounded n-th convergent to exp(1) agrees with the exact value.
%C A138366 This is a measure of the quality of the n-th convergent to E = A001113 if the convergent and the exact value are compared rounded to an increasing number of digits.
%C A138366 The sequence of rounded values of exp(1) is 3, 2.7, 2.72, 2.718, 2.7183, 2.71828, 2.718282, 2.7182818 etc, and the n-th convergent (provided by A007676 and A007677) is to be represented by its equivalent sequence.
%C A138366 a(n) represents the maximum number of post-period digits of the two sequences if compared at the same level of rounding. Counting only post-period digits (which is one less than the full number of decimal digits) is just a convention taken from A084407.
%e A138366 For n=6, the 6th convergent is 106/39 = 2.7179487.., with a sequence of rounded representations 3, 2.7, 2.72, 2.718, 2.7179, 2.71795, 2.717949, etc.
%e A138366 Rounded to 1, 2, or 3 post-period decimal digits, this is the same as the rounded version of the exact E, but disagrees if both are rounded to 4 decimal digits, where 2.7183 <> 2.7179.
%e A138366 So a(6) = 3 (digits), the maximum rounding level of agreement.
