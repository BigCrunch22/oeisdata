%N A138475 Least k such that the x^n coefficient of cyclotomic polynomial Phi(k,x) has the largest possible magnitude.
%C A138475 The maximum possible magnitude of the x^n coefficient is A138474(n). Note that a(0)=0 because we assume Phi(0,x)=1; another convention has Phi(0,x)=x, which would force a(0) and a(1) to be reversed.
%C A138475 It appears that (1) for n>80, a(n) has an even number of prime factors and (2) for prime n>80, n divides a(n). Terms up to n=128 were found by exhaustive search; subsequent terms were found by a much faster hill-climbing method.
