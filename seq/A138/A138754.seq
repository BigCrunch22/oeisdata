%N A138754 a(n) = PrimePi(A138751(n)) - a variation of the Collatz (3n+1) map.
%C A138754 This map is a variation of the Collatz (or 3n+1) map:
%C A138754 Instead of considering the parity of the number, we look at prime(n) mod 3 to decide if this prime should be halved or doubled, before going to the next prime (A007918) and finally back to the positive integers via PrimePi (A000720).
%C A138754 Exactly as for the Collatz (3n+1) map (defined on nonnegative integers), the first element for which it is defined is its only fixed point, and all other starting values seem to end up in a cycle of length 3, here: 4 -> 7 -> 5 -> 4.
%C A138754 Except for p=3, no prime yields a prime result under the map A138750 (as can be seen using p=6k+1 or p=6k-1). Therefore instead of applying primepi() after nextprime(), one could also simply use 1+primepi().
%C A138754 The prime p=3 is also the only case where n == 2 (mod 3) is not equivalent to n != 1 (mod 3). It might have been a better choice to define A138750(x)=2x if x == 1 (mod 3), ceiling(x/2) otherwise. But since here it makes only a difference for p=3, we use the original definition (cf. A124123).

%e A138754 a(4) = 7 since prime(4) = 7 == 1 (mod 3), thus A138750(7) = 2*7 = 14, nextprime(14) = 17, PrimePi(17) = 7 (i.e., 17 is the 7th prime).
%e A138754 a(5) = 4 since prime(5) = 11 == 2 (mod 3), thus A138750(11) = ceiling(11/2) = 6, nextprime(6) = 7, PrimePi(7) = 4 (i.e., 7 is the 4th prime).
