%N A138694 Numbers n such that the set {2*n+p^2, p any prime} contains exactly one prime.
%C A138694 The sequence forms a subset of A016777, as explained below:
%C A138694 For each prime p<>3 we have p^2 =1 (mod 3), see A024700.
%C A138694 (i) For the k where 2*k=2 (mod 3), that is where k=1 (mod 3), this leads to 2*k+p^2=0 (mod 3), so the 2*k+p^2 are divisible by 3 (not prime) unless p=3.
%C A138694 The subcase where 2*k+3^2 is prime generates this sequence here; the subcase where it is not generates A138685.
%C A138694 (ii) For the k where 2*k=0 (mod 3), that is where k=0 (mod 3), one can select any p^2 =1 (mod 3)
%C A138694 to generate a prime 2*k+p^2 = 1 (mod 3), so these k generate many primes (of the form A002476).
%C A138694 (iii) For the k where 2*k=1 (mod 3), that is where k=2 (mod 3), one can select any p^2 =1 (mod 3)
%C A138694 to generate a prime 2*k+p^2 = 2 (mod 3), so these k generate many primes (of the form A003627).
%C A138694 The unique primes associated with each n are in A007528: n=1 associated with A007528(2)=11=2*1+3^2,
%C A138694 n=4 associated with A007528(3)=17=2*4+3^2 etc.

%F A138694 {This sequence here} Union {A138685} = {A016777}.
%e A138694 3 is not in the sequence because {6+2^2, 6+3^3, 6+5^2, 6+7^2,..} = {10, 15, 31, 55,..,127,..,367,..}
%e A138694 contains the primes 31, 127, 367,..., generated with p=5,11,19...
%e A138694 4 is in the sequence because {8+2^2, 8+3^3, 8+5^2, 8+7^2,..} = {12, 17, 33, 57,...} contains
%e A138694 only one prime (that is, 17), generated with p=3.
