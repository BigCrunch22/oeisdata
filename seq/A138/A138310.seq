%N A138310 a(1)=1. a(n) = smallest positive integer not occurring among the first n-1 terms of the sequence that is coprime to n and is coprime to every (nonzero) exponent in the prime factorization of n.
%e A138310 12 has the prime-factorization of 2^2 * 3^1. The positive integers that don't occur among the first 11 terms of the sequence are 10,12,14,15,16,17,18,19,... Of these integers, 17 is the smallest that is coprime to the exponents in the prime factorization of 12 (i.e., coprime to 2 and 1) and is coprime to 12. So a(12) = 17.
