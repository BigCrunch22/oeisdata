%e A138570 840 is a term of this sequence because 840 sets a new record (9) for the number by which it must be multiplied to double its number of divisors (840 has 32 divisors; the smallest number with 64 divisors is 840 * 9 = 7560).
%e A138570 120's record of 7 is not exceeded by any number from 121 to 839.
