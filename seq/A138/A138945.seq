%N A138945 Positive integers not in A132018.
%C A138945 Sequence A132018 was motivated by analogy to A073071.
%C A138945 The latter remains quite dense in N: up to 1000 only about every 5th number is missing, which motivated to introduce its complement in N*, A138945.
%C A138945 While A132018 starts in a similar way, it becomes more and more sparse (since A000041 grows much faster); and consequently the present sequence becomes very dense.
