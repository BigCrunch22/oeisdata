%N A138852 a(n) = round(1/(x-round(x))), where x = (log(744 + (12(n^2-1))^3)/Pi)^2, round(x) = nearest integer to x.
%C A138852 Related to almost-integer values of e^(pi sqrt n), obtained for larger Heegener numbers (A003173): T. Piezas draws attention on the fact that the well-known integers very close to exp(pi sqrt(n)) are of the form (12(k^2-1))^3+744. Here this is expressed as the (rounded value) of the reciprocal of the (signed) distance from the integers of the n-value corresponding to a given integer k-value. As expected, records are obtained for k = 3, 9, 21, 231.

%e A138852 We have a(3) = 1435303 since (12(3^2-1))^3+744 = e^(pi sqrt(x)) with x = 19.0000006967... = 19 + 1/1435302.833...
%e A138852 In the same way, a(231)=43072298941682041177938098750 since (12(231^2-1))^3+744 = e^(pi sqrt(x)) with x = 163.0000000000000000000000000000232 = 163 + 1/43072298941682041177938098749.8977...
