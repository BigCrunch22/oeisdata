%N A138369 Count of post-period decimal digits up to which the rounded n-th convergent to 4*sin(4*Pi/5) agrees with the exact value.
%C A138369 This is a measure of the quality of the n-th convergent to 4*sin(4*Pi/5) = sqrt(2)*sqrt(5-sqrt(5)) = 2.351141009169892... if the convergent and the exact value are compared rounded to an increasing number of digits.
%C A138369 The sequence of rounded values of the sine (or square root) is 2, 2.4, 2.35, 2.351, 2.3511, 2.35114, 2.351141, 2.3511410 etc. The n-th convergents are 5/2 (n=1), 7/3 (n=2), 40/17 (n=3), 47/20, 87/37, 221/94, 308/131 etc. and are represented by their equivalent rounding sequence.
%C A138369 a(n) is the maximum number of post-period digits of the two rounding sequences if compared at the same level of rounding. Counting only post-period digits (which is one less than the total number of decimal digits) is just a convention taken from A084407.
%e A138369 For n=4, the 4th convergent is 47/20 = 2.350000000..., with a sequence of rounded representations 2, 2.4, 2.35, 2.350, 2.3500, 2.35000, etc.
%e A138369 Rounded to 1 or 2 post-period decimal digits, this is the same as the rounded version of the exact square root, but disagrees if both are rounded to 3 decimal digits, where 2.351 <> 2.350.
%e A138369 So a(4) = 2 (digits), the maximum rounding level of agreement.
