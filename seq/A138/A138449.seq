%N A138449 Prime gaps between the first occurrence of successive primes of the form (2^n)! + m.
%F A138449 A prime gap is defined here as the difference between successive primes - 1.
%F A138449 a(n) = A138346(n)-A136146(n)-1. - _R. J. Mathar_, Sep 10 2016
%e A138449 The first prime after (2^12)! = 4096! = 4096! + 26297. The next prime after that is 4096! + 41999. So the prime gap between this first occurrence of two successive primes is 41999-26296-1 = 15701, the last entry in the sequence.
%o A138449 PFGW was used to find the successive primes.
