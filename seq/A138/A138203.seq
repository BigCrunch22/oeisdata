%N A138203 Sieve: start with the natural numbers; at the n-th step in the sieve remove every A138204(n)-th term from the sequence remaining in the prior step, where A138204 is the complement to this sequence starting with A138204(1)=2.
%C A138203 Terms computed by _Joshua Zucker_.
%e A138203 Process: start with the natural numbers and then
%e A138203 delete every 2nd term:
%e A138203 (1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,...);
%e A138203 4 is missing, so delete every 4th term (7,15,23,...):
%e A138203 (1,3,5,9,11,13,17,19,21,25,27,29,...);
%e A138203 6 is missing, so delete every 6th term (13,29,...):
%e A138203 (1,3,5,9,11,17,19,21,25,27,...);
%e A138203 7 is missing, delete the 7th term (19,...):
%e A138203 (1,3,5,9,11,17,21,25,27,...);
%e A138203 8 is missing, delete the 8th term (25,...):
%e A138203 (1,3,5,9,11,17,21,27,...);
%e A138203 continue in this way to generate this sequence;
%e A138203 the missing terms form sequence A138204.
%Y A138203 Cf. A138204.
