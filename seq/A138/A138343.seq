%N A138343 Count of post-period decimal digits up to which the rounded n-th convergent to Pi agrees with the exact value.
%C A138343 This is a measure of the quality of the n-th convergent to A000796 if the convergent and the exact value are compared rounded to an increasing number of digits. (This is similar to A084407 which compares the truncated/floored values).
%C A138343 The sequence of rounded values of Pi is 3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.142, 3.1416, 3.14159, 3.141593, 3.1415927 etc, and the n-th convergent (provided by A002485 and A002486) is to be represented by its equivalent sequence.
%C A138343 a(n) represents the maximum number of post-period digits of the two sequences if compared at the same level of rounding. Counting only post-period digits (which is one less than the full number of decimal digits) is just a convention taken from A084407.
%e A138343 For n=3, the 3rd convergent is 355/113 = 3.141592920353.., with a sequence of rounded representations 3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.142, 3.1416, 3.141593, 3.1415929, 3.14159292 etc.
%e A138343 Rounded to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 post-period decimal digits, this is the same as the rounded version of the exact Pi, but disagrees if both are rounded to 7 decimal digits, where 3.1415927 <> 3.1415929.
%e A138343 So a(3) = 6 (digits), the maximum rounding level of agreement.
