%N A138750 a(n) = ceiling(n/2) if n == 2 (mod 3), a(n) = 2n otherwise.
%C A138750 This map is inspired by A124123, which hides in fact a variation of the Collatz problem, defined on the set of primes and working mod 3 instead of mod 2. See A138751 for more information.
%C A138750 The use of ceiling() is here equivalent to round().
%C A138750 The main reason for defining this function is to write A124123 as complement of A007918(A138750(A000040)), and to express the recursion function occurring there in terms of this map.
%C A138750 It might have been more natural to define this map as a(n) = 2n if n == 1 (mod 3), a(n) = ceiling(n/2) otherwise, which is equivalent for all primes > 3 (which are either == 1 or == 2 (mod 3)) and would have "better" properties regarding the analysis of orbits of all integers under this map.
%C A138750 However, for the prime n=3 it does make a difference, and in order to reproduce the map occurring in A124123, we had to adopt the present convention.
