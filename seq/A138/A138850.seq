%N A138850 Weird numbers (A006037) not divisible by 5.
%C A138850 Up to 200000, there are only 11 weird numbers not divisible by 5.
%C A138850 Since no A006037(k) < 10^17 is odd, at least up to there, "divisible by 5" is equivalent to "ending in 0" (in base 10).
%C A138850 It appears that 4*11*19*p is an element of this sequence for p=1 and all primes p>547. Moreover, these seem to comprise most of the terms of this sequence.
%C A138850 Up to n=500, the only indices for which a(n) is not of this form are n=2,...,16, 18, 34, 38, 43, 64, 83, 148, 158, 236, 266, 296, 310.
