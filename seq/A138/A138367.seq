%N A138367 Count of post-period decimal digits up to which the rounded n-th convergent to sqrt(5) agrees with the exact value.
%C A138367 This is a measure of the quality of the n-th convergent to A002163 if the convergent and the exact value are compared rounded to an increasing number of digits.
%C A138367 The sequence of rounded values of sqrt(5) is 2, 2.2, 2.24, 2.236, 2.2361, 2.23607, 2.236068, 2.2360680 etc, and the n-th convergent (provided by A001077 and A001076) is to be represented by its equivalent sequence.
%C A138367 a(n) represents the maximum number of post-period digits of the two sequences if compared at the same level of rounding. Counting only post-period digits (which is one less than the full number of decimal digits) is just a convention taken from A084407.
%e A138367 For n=3, the 3rd convergent is 161/72 = 2.236111111..., with a sequence of rounded representations 2, 2.2, 2.24, 2.236, 2.2361, 2.23611, 2.236111, 2.2361111 etc.
%e A138367 Rounded to 1, 2, 3, or 4 post-period decimal digits, this is the same as the rounded version of the exact sqrt(5), but disagrees if both are rounded to 5 decimal digits, where 2.23607 <> 2.23611.
%e A138367 So a(3) = 4 (digits), the maximum rounding level of agreement.
