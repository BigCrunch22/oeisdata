%N A138551 Moment sequence of t^3 coefficient in det(tI-A) for random matrix A in USp(6).
%C A138551 Let the random variable X be the coefficient of t^3 in the characteristic polynomial det(tI-A) of a random matrix in USp(6) (6x6 complex matrices that are unitary and symplectic). Then a(n) = E[X^n].
%C A138551 Let L_p(T) be the L-polynomial (numerator of the zeta function) of a genus 3 curve C. Under a generalized Sato-Tate conjecture, for almost all C, a(n) is the n-th moment of the coefficient of t^3 in L_p(t/sqrt(p)), as p varies.
