%N A138664 a(n) = number of positive integers k, k <= n, where the number of one's in the binary representation of each k divides n.

%e A138664 The integers 1 through 9 in binary are (1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001). So the numbers of 1's in these binary representations form the sequence (1,1,2,1,2,2,3,1,2) (the first 9 terms of sequence A000120, starting from A000120(1)). 9 is divisible by all the 1's (there are 4 of those) and by the one 3. So a(9) = 4+1 = 5.
