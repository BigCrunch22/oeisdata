%N A138103 Numbers with an odd number of 1's in base 6 expansion.
%C A138103 This is to A007092 (numbers in base 6) as A000069 (odious numbers: odd number of 1's in binary expansion) is to A007088 (numbers written in base 2) and as A137469 is to A007091 (numbers in base 5). Note that odd number of 1's in base 3 expansion is simply the odd numbers. This sequence includes, as a subset, A043373 = numbers n such that number of 1's in base 6 is 1.
%C A138103 This is strictly different from A043373.
%C A138103 Terms in this sequence but not in A043374 are 43, 223, 253, 258, 260, 261, 262, 263, 265, 271, 277, 283, 295, ... - _R. J. Mathar_, May 13 2008
