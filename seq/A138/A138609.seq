%N A138609 List the first term from A042963, then 2 terms from A014601 (starting from 3), 3 terms from A042963, 4 terms from A014601, etc.
%C A138609 The original name was "Generalized Connell sequence". However, this sequence has only a passing resemblance to Connell-like sequences (see A001614 and the paper by Iannucci & Mills-Taylor), which are all monotone, while this sequence is a bijection of natural numbers.
%C A138609 The sequence is formed by concatenating subsequences S1,S2,S3,..., each of finite length. The subsequence S1 consists of the element 1. The n-th subsequence has n elements. Each subsequence is nondecreasing. The difference between two consecutive elements in the same subsequence is varying, but >= 1.

%e A138609 Let us separate natural numbers into two disjoint sets (A042963 and A014601):
%e A138609   1,2,5,6,9,10,13,14,17,18,21,22,25,26,29,30,...
%e A138609   3,4,7,8,11,12,15,16,19,20,23,24,27,28,31,32,...
%e A138609 then
%e A138609   S1={1}
%e A138609   S2={3,4}
%e A138609   S3={2,5,6,}
%e A138609   S4={7,8,11,12}
%e A138609   S5={9,10,13,14,17}
%e A138609   ...
%e A138609   and concatenating S1/S2/S3/S4/S5/... gives this sequence.
%Y A138609 Inverse: A166016. Cf. A138606, A138607, A138608, A138612.
