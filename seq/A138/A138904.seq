%N A138904 Number of rotational symmetries in the binary expansion of a number.
%C A138904 Mersenne numbers of form (2^n - 1) have n rotational symmetries.
%C A138904 For prime length binary expansions these are the only nontrivial symmetries.
%C A138904 For composite length expansions it seems that when the number of symmetries is nontrivial it is equal to a factor of the length. We're working on an explicit formula.
%C A138904 Discovered in the context of random circulant matrices, examining if there's a correlation between degrees of freedom and number of symmetries in the first row.
%C A138904 When combined with A138954, these two sequences should give a full account of the number of redundant rows in a circulant square matrix with at most two distinct values, where a(n) is the encoding of the first row of the matrix into binary such that value a = 1 and value b = 0.
%C A138904 Discovered on the night of Apr 02, 2008 by Maxwell Sills and Gary Doran.
%C A138904 Conjecture: For binary expansions of length n, there are d(n) distinct values that will show up as symmetries, where d is the divisor function. The symmetry values will be precisely the divisors of n.
%C A138904 Example: for binary expansions of length 12, one sees that d(12) = 6 distinct values show up as symmetries (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12).
%C A138904 Conjecture: For numbers whose binary expansion has length n which has proper divisors which are all coprime: There will be only one number of length n with n symmetries. That number is 2^n - 1. For each proper divisor d (excluding 1), you can generate all numbers of length n that have n/d symmetries like so: (2^0 + 2^d + 2^2d ... 2^(n-d)) * a, where 2^(d-1) <= a < (2^d) - 1. The rest of the expansions of length n will have only the trivial symmetry.
%C A138904 Also the number of rotational symmetries of the n-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic). This composition (row n of A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of n, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. - _Gus Wiseman_, Apr 19 2020
