%N A138967 Infinite Fibonacci word on the alphabet {1,2,3,4}.
%C A138967 Start with the infinite Fibonacci word A003849, which is 0100101001001010010... and replace each 0 by 1,2,3 and each 1 by 1,4.
%C A138967 (a(n)) is the unique fixed point of the morphism 1->12, 2->3, 3->14, 4->3, obtained by coding the overlapping 3-block morphism of the Fibonacci morphism according to 010<->1, 100<->2, 001<->3, 101<->4. - _Michel Dekking_, Sep 28 2017

%F A138967 Let A(n)=floor(n*tau), B(n)=n+floor(n*tau); i.e., A and B are the lower and upper Wythoff sequences, A=A000201, B=A001950. a(n)=1 if n=A(A(k)) for some k; a(n)=2 if n=B(A(k)) for some k; a(n)=3 if n=A(B(k)) for some k; a(n)=4 if n=B(B(k)) for some k.
