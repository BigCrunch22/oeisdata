%N A138954 Number of complement symmetries in the rotations of the binary expansion of a number.
%C A138954 It seems that the number of complement rotational symmetries is nonzero iff #0 = #1 in the binary expansion of a number.
%C A138954 The above statement is true in only one direction. It is clearly necessary for the number of 1 bits to equal the number of 0 bits. However, this is not sufficient. The first counterexample is n = 37 with binary expansion 100101 and complement 011010. Values of n for which a(n) is nonzero are therefore a proper subset of A031443. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Jan 12 2020

%e A138954 a(2) = 1 because 2 has binary expansion 10 and the complement shows up once in rotations;
%e A138954 a(10) = 2 because 10 has binary expansion 1010 and its complement shows up twice in rotations.
