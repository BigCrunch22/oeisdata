%N A138758 Index of A001203(n) (continued fraction for Pi) in A000040 (primes), or 0 if A001203(n) is not prime.
%F A138758 a(n) = A000720(A001203(n)) * A010051(A001203(n)).
%e A138758 This sequence starts 2,4,0,0,... since the 1st and 2nd terms of the continued fraction expansion of Pi, A001203 = (3, 7, 15, 1, ...) are the 2nd resp. 4th primes, while the next two terms are not primes.
