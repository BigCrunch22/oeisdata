%N A138900 First gap of length at least n in A136110, lower end.
%e A138900 First few terms of A136110 are 1,3,4,6,7,9,12,13,15,17,18,22,23,... . The first gap of length 1 is between 1 and 3, hence a(1) = 1; the first gap of length 2 is between 9 and 12, hence a(2) = 9; the first gap of length 3 is between 18 and 22, hence a(3) = 18. The first gap of length at least 7 is between 2580 and 2592; it has length 11,
%e A138900 hence a(7) = a(8) = a(9) = a(10) = a(11) = 2580.
%Y A138900 Cf. A136110, A138899, A138845.
