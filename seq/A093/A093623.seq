%N A093623 Smallest k>0 such that n!/k!-1 is prime.
%C A093623 a(A002982(n)) = 1. The existence of a solution has been checked up to n=500.
%C A093623 The results were computed using the PrimeFormGW (PFGW) primality-testing program. - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Nov 14 2019
%e A093623 a(10) = 6 because 10!/6! - 1 = 5039 is prime, whereas 10!/k! - 1 is composite for k = 1..5.
%Y A093623 Cf. A093622 largest prime of the form n!/k!-1, A002982 n!-1 is prime, A093621 smallest k>0 such that n!/k!+1 is prime.
