%N A093489 Define the total signature symmetry of a number n to be the number of values r takes such that n-r and n+r have the same prime signature. Sequence contains the total signature symmetry of n.
%C A093489 Number of partitions of 2n in two parts with identical prime signatures. Conjecture: (1) No term is zero for n > 3. (2) Every number k appears a finitely many times in the sequence. I.e., for every k there exists a number f(k) such that for all n > f(k), a(n) > k. Subsidiary sequence: the frequency of n.
