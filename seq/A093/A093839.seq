%N A093839 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers such that the n-th partial sum and n-th partial product are divisible by n.
%e A093839 1 is divisible by 1, but a(1) cannot be 1, because a(2) would have to be odd to make an even sum, but even to make an even product. Similarly, 2+4+3+7 and 2*4*3*7 are both divisible by 4, but if a(4) were 7 then a(5) would not exist, so a(4) = 11.
