%N A093439 Least number n with a given prime signature such that all numbers >= n with this prime signature are one less than a composite number.
%C A093439 This is to categorize prime signatures such that p^a*q^b*r^c ... +1 is composite, p,q,r are arbitrarily chosen primes. Example: Perfect odd powers + 1 is always composite. Are there other examples? Exceptions like 3 and 5 are to be ignored.
%e A093439 8 = 2^3 is a member as 8 has a prime signature p^3 and all numbers of the form p^3+1 are composite.
%e A093439 9 is also a member though 2^2+1 = 5 is a prime but for all odd primes p^2+1 is even.
%e A093439 216 = 2^3*3^3 is a member because p^3*q^3+1 is always divisible by pq+1.
%Y A093439 Cf. A093438.
%K A093439 nonn
