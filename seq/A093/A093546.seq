%N A093546 Numbers n such that n divides 2^n^2 + 1.
%C A093546 This sequence is closed under multiplication. A006521 is a subsequence of this sequence. A006521 is also closed under multiplication. In fact if m is even and k is a natural number then the sequence "n divides m^n^k + 1" is a subsequence of the sequence "n divides m^n^(k+1)+ 1" and both are closed under multiplication.
%C A093546 "Closed under multiplication" means that if x and y are terms then so is x*y.
