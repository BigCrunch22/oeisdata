%N A093514 Transform of the prime sequence by the Rule90 cellular automaton.
%C A093514 As described in A051006, a monotonic sequence can be mapped into a fractional real. Then the binary digits of that real can be treated (transformed) by an elementary cellular automaton. Taken resulted sequence of binary digits as a fractional real, it can be mapped back into a sequence, as in A092855.
%C A093514 n is in this sequence if either n-2 OR n is prime but not both. Similar simple propositional rules can be given for all "RuleXXX" transforms of primes (or any strictly monotone sequence with a well-defined characteristic function) because the idea in these sequences is to take the characteristic function, consider it as an infinite binary word, apply one generation of some one-dimensional cellular automaton rule "XXX" to it and define the new sequence by this characteristic function. - _Antti Karttunen_, Apr 22 2004
%C A093514 For example, 2 is included because 0 is not prime, but 2 is. 3 is included because 1 is not prime, but 3 is. 4 is included because 2 is prime, although 4 is not. 5 is not included because both 3 and 5 are primes, 9 is included because 7 is prime, but 9 is not.
