%N A093782 a(n) is the smallest initial value (a prime) for the Euclid-Mullin (EM) sequence in which the p=5 prime emerges as n-th term, i.e., arises at the n-th position.
%C A093782 The sequence is not monotonic and it seems that p=5 may arise at any position > 2. a(2)=0 means that 5 is never the 2nd term in an EM sequence of A000945-type because a(2)=2 or 3.
%C A093782 a(31)>=8581. [_Sean A. Irvine_, Oct 31 2011]
%e A093782 The sequence for 17 is 17, 2, 5, ... where the 5 is at the third place, therefore a(3)=17.
%e A093782 For n=15 we have the sequence 181, 2, 3, 1087, 73, 7, 29, 151, 61, 98689, 11, 10929259909, 678859, 97, 5, ...
%e A093782 a(16) = 449 uses the sequence 449, 2, 29, 3, 7, 349, 190861819, 166273, 16091, 11, 3807491, 53, 17, 313, 23, 5, ...
%e A093782 The sequence for 11 is 11, 2, 23, 3, 7, 13, 10805892983887, 73, 6397, 19, 489407, 2753, 87491, 18618443, 5, ... with the 5 at the 18th place, so a(18)=11.
