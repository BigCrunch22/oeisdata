%N A093931 a(1) = 3; for n>1, a(n) = smallest odd prime not already in the sequence such that a(n)-a(n-1) is twice a prime.
%C A093931 Is it true that every odd prime appears?
%e A093931 a(14) = Min{p such that p is in A000040 and a(n)-a(n+1) is in A100484 and not a(n+1) = a(k) for k <= n} = previously unused primes in S = 41 - {4, 6, 10, 14, 22, 26, 34, 38}. S = {3, 7, 15, 19, 27, 31, 35, 37}. Primes in S are {3, 7, 19, 31, 37}. But these are all terms equal or prior to a(13), hence we now seek the smallest prime p new to the sequence such that p - 41 is an even semiprime. S' = 41 + {A100484} = {45, 47, 51, 55, 63, 67, 75, 79, ...}. Primes in this are {47, 67, 79, ...} of which the minimum is a(14) = 47. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Mar 20 2006
