%N A093492 Define the divisor symmetry of a number n to be k if n-r and n+r have the same number of divisors for r = 1 to k but not for k+1. Sequence contains the divisor symmetry of n.
%C A093492 Subsidiary sequence: Index of the first occurrence of n in this sequence.
%C A093492 Is this sequence bounded? Through n = 20000, a(432)=6 is the only value greater than 4. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, May 12 2006
%C A093492 I conjecture that the sequence is unbounded. [_Charles R Greathouse IV_, Dec 19 2011]
