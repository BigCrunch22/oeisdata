%N A093903 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) = a(n-1)-p if there exists a prime p (take the smallest) that has not yet been used and is such that a(n) is new and > 0, otherwise a(n) = a(n-1)+p if the same conditions are satisfied.
%C A093903 A variation of Cald's sequence A006509; a sequence of distinct positive integers with property that absolute successive differences are distinct primes.
%C A093903 A more long-winded definition: Start with a(1) = 1. Keep a list of the primes that have been used so far; initially this list is empty. Each prime can be used at most once.
%C A093903 To get a(n), subtract from a(n-1) each prime p < a(n-1) that has not yet been used, starting from the smallest. If for any such p, a(n-1)-p is not yet in the sequence, set a(n) = a(n-1)-p and mark p as used.
%C A093903 If no p works, then add each prime p that has not yet been used to a(n-1), again starting with the smallest. When p is such that a(n-1)+p is not yet in the sequence, set a(n) = a(n-1)+p and mark p as used. Repeat.
%C A093903 The main question is: does every number appear in the sequence?

%e A093903 1 -> 1+2 = 3 and prime 2 has been used.
%e A093903 3 -> 3+3 = 6 and prime 3 has been used.
%e A093903 6 could go to 6-5 = 1, except 1 is already in the sequence; so 6 -> 6+5 = 11 and prime 5 has been used.
%e A093903 11 -> 11-7 = 4 (for the first time we can subtract) and prime 7 has been used.
