%N A093424 Number of two-dimensional burst patterns of size n, i.e., translation inequivalent subsets of the grid Z^2 which can be covered by a connected subset of n elements (in the sense of von Neumann neighborhoods).
%C A093424 Original definition: Number of different two-dimensional burst patterns in the grid graph: The grid graph has Z^2 as vertices and each vertex (x,y) is connected to (x-1,y),(x+1,y),(x,y-1),(x,y+1). A cluster of size t is a set of t points such that each pair of points of the set is on a connected path contained entirely within the set. A burst pattern is a labeling of Z^2 with 0's and 1's. The term a(n) denotes the number of different (up to a translation) burst patterns whose 1's are covered by a cluster of size n.
%C A093424 As shown in the examples 3, 5, 6 and 7 below, the set need not be connected itself. But this is always the case when it has n points; in such a case, it coincides with the covering set. - _M. F. Hasler_, Aug 28 2014

%e A093424 The absence of a V-shaped pattern, which would have a (taxicab) "diameter" of 3 but cannot be covered by a 3-element connected set, illustrates that the latter condition cannot be replaced by the former. - _M. F. Hasler_, Aug 28 2014
