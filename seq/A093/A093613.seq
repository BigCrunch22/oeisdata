%N A093613 Table read by rows: row n is the n-th Primary Phyllotaxis Sequence (PPS), which has F(n+1) terms, where F(n) is the n-th Fibonacci number. For 1 <= k < F(n+1), a(n, k) = -k*F(n-1) mod F(n+1). a(n, F(n+1)) = F(n+1).
%C A093613 Related to the arrangement of stalks or florets on a plant.
%C A093613 In the reference, the rows of the table appear as rings of the Primary Phyllotaxis Wheel, alternating clockwise and counterclockwise.
