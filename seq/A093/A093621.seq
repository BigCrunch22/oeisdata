%N A093621 Smallest k>0 such that n!/k!+1 is prime.
%C A093621 The results were computed using the PrimeFormGW (PFGW) primality-testing program. - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Nov 14 2019
%F A093621 a(A002981(n)) = 1.
%e A093621 a(39) =37 because 39!/k!+1 is composite for all k=1..36; 39!/37!+1=39*38+1=1483 is prime.
%Y A093621 Cf. A093437 largest prime of the form n!/k!+1, A002981 n!+1 is prime, A093623 Smallest k>0 such that n!/k!-1 is prime.
