%C A100878 From _Bernard Schott_, Jul 15 2022: (Start)
%C A100878 In September 1636, Fermat, in a letter to Mersenne, made the statement that every number is a sum of at most three triangular numbers, four squares, five pentagonal numbers, and so on.
%C A100878 The square case was proved by Lagrange in 1770; it is known as Lagrange's four squares theorem (see A002828). Then Gauss proved the triangular case in 1796 (see A061336).
%C A100878 In 1813, Cauchy proved this polygonal number theorem: for m >= 3, every positive integer N can be represented as a sum of m+2 (m+2)-gonal numbers, at most four of which are different from 0 and 1 (Deza reference). Hence every number is expressible as the sum of at most five positive pentagonal numbers (A000326). (End)
