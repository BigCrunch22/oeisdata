%N A100263 Values of n such that A080221(n)=5; i.e., values of n such that n is divisible by the sum of digits of n when expressed in exactly 5 of the bases b=1...n.
%C A100263 It appears that, except for the first term a(1)=9, each term of this sequence is twice a prime.
%C A100263 Besides base 1, and bases b>=n (bases greater than or equal to the number itself), for which any number can be a Harshad number, these numbers are Harshad numbers in 3 other bases (where b=2..n-1): b1, b2, and b3, where b1 is n/2, b2 is n/2 + 1, b3 is n-1. Except for a(1)=9 that is a Harshad number in bases 3, 4 and 7. - _Daniel Mondot_, Apr 03 2016
