%N A100553 Prime numbers (including 1) whose number of digits is a power of 2, all digits from the set {1,2,3,5,7}, such that each half of the number is already in this sequence.
%C A100553 The sequence would be tragically short were the '1' not there.
%C A100553 From _Robert Israel_, Dec 04 2019: (Start)
%C A100553 There are 5 terms with 1 digit, 9 with 2 digits, 12 with 4 digits, 15 with 8 digits, 15 with 16 digits, 7 with 32 digits, and only 1 with 64 digits, which must be the last term. (End)
