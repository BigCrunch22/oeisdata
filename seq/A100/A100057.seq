%N A100057 Sum of absolute differences of p(n) defined in A054065, oriented around a clock.
%F A100057 Arrange p(n) of A054065 around a clock. a(n) = sum of absolute differences between terms. Alternatively, take the absolute difference between left and rightmost terms of p(n), A054065; and add to A100056(n).
%e A100057 a(4) = 8 since p(4) of A054065 = 2 4 1 3. Placing the terms in circular fashion and taking absolute differences: 2, 3, 2, 1; sum = 8.
%Y A100057 Cf. A100056.
