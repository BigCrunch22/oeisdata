%N A100253 Let j be the smallest integer for which 1+(1+1*n)+(1+2*n)+...+(1+j*n)=k^2=s. Then a(n)=1+j*n; if no such j exists, then a(n)=0.
%C A100253 Basis for sequence is shortest arithmetic series with initial term 1 and difference n that sums to a perfect square.
%F A100253 1+(1+1*n)+(1+2*n)+...+(1+A100254(n)*n)= 1+(1+1*n)+(1+2*n)+...+a(n)=A100251(n)^2=A100252(n)
%e A100253 a(3)=241 since 1 + 4 + 7 +...+ 241 = 99^2 = 9801 and no other arithmetic series with initial term 1, difference 3 and fewer terms sums to a perfect square.
