%N A100464 Write down the numbers from 3 to infinity. Take next number, M say, that has not been crossed off and cross off all the numbers i*M + 1 for i >= 1. Repeat. The numbers that are left form the sequence.
%C A100464 Equivalently, each term is the lowest natural number n such that n mod k is not 1 for any number k in the sequence so far. Also, the average difference between terms grows as O(2 log log n). - _Trevor Cappallo_, Sep 10 2019
