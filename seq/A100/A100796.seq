%N A100796 Equivalence class of numerical representation of n. See Comments for definition.
%C A100796 The 10 digits 0,1,...,9 (written in a sans serif font) are covered by 5 equivalence classes: C_0 = {0}, a circle; C_1 = {1, 2, 3, 5, 7}, a line segment; C_4 = {4}, a circle with a point to which is glued two line segments; C_6 = {6, 9}, a circle with a point to which is glued a line segment; C_8 = {8}, a figure eight.
%C A100796 This is different from the topological classification, which would classify the digits according to their genus: {1,2,3,5,7}, {0,4,6,9} and {8}.
