%N A100791 Group the natural numbers so that the n-th group contains n(n+1)/2 = T(n) terms: (1), (2,3,4), (5,6,7,8,9,10), (11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20),(21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35),... The n-th row of the following triangle is formed from the sum of first n terms, next n-1 terms,next n-2 terms ... of the n-th group; e.g. third row is (5+6+7), (8+9), (10) or 18,17,10. Sequence contains the triangle read by rows.
%C A100791 The leading diagonal is A000292 (tetrahedral (or pyramidal) numbers: C(n+3,3) = (n+1)(n+2)(n+3)/6.)
%C A100791 The sequence contains very few duplicate terms. In the first 10000 terms, only 12 are duplicates and there are no terms that repeat more than two times. - _Harvey P. Dale_, Jun 10 2018
