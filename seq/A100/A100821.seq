%N A100821 a(n) = 1 if prime(n) + 2 = prime(n+1), otherwise 0.
%C A100821 Same as A062301 except for starting point.
%C A100821 a(n)=1 iff prime(n) is the smaller of a pair of twin primes, else a(n)=0. This sequence can be derived from the sequence b(n)=1 iff n and n+2 are both prime, else b(n)=0. This latter sequence has as its inverse Moebius transform the sequence c(n) = the number of distinct factors of n which are the smaller of a pair of twin primes. For example, c(15)=2 because 15 is divisible by 3 and 5, each of which is the smaller of a pair of twin primes. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Jan 07 2005
