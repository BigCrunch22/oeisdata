%N A100748 Years of recorded appearances of Halley's Comet (negative years are B.C.).
%C A100748 This sequence is not well-defined for many reasons (negative years are ill-defined; calendars change often, so when does a year begin?; what does "observed" mean?; what if the comet was observed both at the end of one year and at the beginning of another, as in 1985/1986?; etc.). - _N.
