%N A100711 Table read by antidiagonals: T(m,n) gives the ordinal number in the table of permutations of length n+1 of the permutation which reverses the first m+1 items on a list of length n+1, leaving the remaining items unaltered. For example, T(5,7) is 28494 and the 28494th row of the permutation table of order 8 is 5 4 3 2 1 0 6 7.
%C A100711 The first 8 rows and columns of T are:

%F A100711 T(m, n) is given by the dot product of (m, m-1, m-2, ..., 1) and (n!, (n-1)!, ..., (1+n-m)!).
%e A100711 T(5,7) is 28494 because we can write (5,4,3,2,1) dot (7!,6!,5!,4!.3!), or (5,4,3,2,1) dot (5040,720,120,24,6) or 28494.
%o A100711 In Iverson's J language, the program can be written functionally, in Backus's sense: F100711 =: ( [: (- i.) [ ) ( +/ .* ! ) ] ( - i. ) [ ) (- i. 5) is 5 4 3 2 1; (7 (- i.) 5) is 7 6 5 4 3 5 4 3 2 1 (+ / . * !) 7 6 5 4 3 is the dot product of the left argument with the factorials of the right argument, or 28494. So 5 F100711 7 will be 28494.
