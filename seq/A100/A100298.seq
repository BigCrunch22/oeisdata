%N A100298 Similar to Cald's sequence (A006509), but move by the n-th composite instead of by the n-th prime.
%e A100298 The 4th term is 3 and the 4th composite is 9.
%e A100298 3 - 9 is negative, so instead add 9 to 3 to get 12, which becomes the 5th term because 12 is not among the earlier terms of the sequence.
