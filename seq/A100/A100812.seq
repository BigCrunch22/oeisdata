%N A100812 {a(n)} is monotone increasing, with a(1)=1, a(2)=3 and, for n>2, a(n) is the smallest integer such that a(n) mod a(j) is never a(i) for any pair i,j with 1<=i<j<n.
%e A100812 a(8)<>28, since 28=1 mod 27. But the residues of 29 modulo 3,5,9,15,17 and 27 are 2,4,2,14,12 and 2, none of which are earlier terms of the sequence, so a(8)=29.
