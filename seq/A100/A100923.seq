%N A100923 a(n) = 1 iff 6*n+1 and 6*n-1 are both prime numbers (0 otherwise).
%C A100923 Characteristic function of A002822. - _Georg Fischer_, Aug 04 2021
%e A100923 a(3) = 1 because 6*3-1=17 and 6*3+1=19 are both prime.
%e A100923 a(4) = 0 because 6*4-1=23 is prime and 6*4+1=25 is not prime.
%e A100923 a(20) = 0 because 6*20-1=119 and 6*20+1=121 are both not prime.
