%N A100056 Sum of absolute differences of p(n) defined in A054065.
%C A100056 Conjecture: a(n) provides the maximum sum of difference terms of any permutation of 1 through n. A054065 (or reversals) give the optimal permutations and a(n) gives the sum.
%F A100056 a(n) = sum, (abs. values) of difference row of p(n), A054065.
%e A100056 a(4) = 7 since p(4) of A054065 = 2 4 1 3. Finite difference row (abs. values) of p(4) = 2 3 2; sum = 7.
%Y A100056 Cf. A100057, clock-oriented analogous sequence.
