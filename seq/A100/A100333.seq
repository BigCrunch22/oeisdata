%N A100333 Numbers n such that decimal expansion of exp(n) has fractional part beginning with n.
%C A100333 This sequence (like A100323 relative to A100322) is not necessarily a subset of A100332 because there may exist an n1<n such that the decimal places of both exp(n1) and exp(n) begin with n. Then n appears in this sequence, but n1 appears in A100332.
%e A100333 E.g. exp(40)=235385266837019985.40...
%e A100333 exp(55)=769478526514201713818274.55...
%e A100333 exp(71)=6837671229762743866755892826677.71... etc
%Y A100333 Cf. A100323 for analogous sequence relating to powers of Pi.
