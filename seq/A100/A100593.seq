%N A100593 Greatest positive integer that can be represented as the sum of exactly two semiprimes in exactly n ways.
%F A100593 a(n) = max{i such that i = A001358(j) + A001358(k) in n ways}.
%e A100593 a(0) = 33 is only a conjecture, based on computer searches by Lior Manor and by Ray Chandler. a(1) = 62 because 62 = 58 + 4 is the only way to partition 62 into two semiprimes.
