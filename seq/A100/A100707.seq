%N A100707 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n+1)=a(n)-k if there exists a positive number k (take the smallest) that has not yet been used and is such that a(n+1) is new and >0, otherwise a(n+1) = a(n)+k if the same conditions are satisfied.
%C A100707 A sequence of distinct natural numbers with the property that absolute successive differences are distinct.
%C A100707 A more long-winded definition: start with a(1) = 1. We keep a list of the numbers k that have been used as differences so far; initially this list is empty. Each difference can be used at most once.
%C A100707 Suppose a(n) = M. To get a(n+1), we subtract from M each number k < M that has not yet been used, starting from the smallest. If for any such k, M-k is a number not yet in the sequence, set a(n+1) = M-k and mark the difference k as used.
%C A100707 If no k works, then we add each number k that has not yet been used to M, again starting with the smallest. When we find a k such that M+k is a number not yet in the sequence, we set a(n+1) = M+k and mark k as used. Repeat.
%C A100707 The main question is: does every number appear in the sequence?
%C A100707 A227617(n) = smallest m such that a(m) = n: if this sequence is a permutation of the natural numbers, then A227617 is its inverse. - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Jul 19 2013

%e A100707 1 -> 1+1 = 2 and k=1 has been used as a difference.
%e A100707 2 -> 2+4 = 4 and k=2 has been used as a difference.
%e A100707 4 could go to 4-3 = 1, except that 1 has already appeared in the sequence; so 4 -> 4+3 = 7 and k=3 has been used as a difference.
%e A100707 7 -> 7-4 = 3 (for the first time we can subtract) and k=4 has been used as a difference. And so on.
