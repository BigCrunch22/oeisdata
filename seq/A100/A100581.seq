%N A100581 Male of (1/(n+1), n/(1+n)) pair function used to get a dual population Fibonacci.
%C A100581 These are rational functions and to get an integer popoulation a Floor[] function is necessary.(* if the Fibonacci is a rabbit population, then it has male and female components *) (* in this case the gfib (female) population is always larger or the same *) (* natural birth rate has the female popoulation slightly larger than the male in many mammals *) (* ratios of both populations still approach the golden mean *)
%F A100581 f[n_]:=(1/(n+1))^mod[n, 2]*(n/(n+1))^(1-mod[n, 2]) fib[n_Integer?Positive] :=fib[n] =fib[n-1]+fib[n-2] fib[0]=0;fib[1] = 1; ffib[n_Integer?Positive] :=ffib[n] =ffib[n-1]*f[n-1]+ffib[n-2]*f[n-2] ffib[0]=0;ffib[1] = 1; a(n) = Floor[ffib[n]*fib[n]]
