%C A100585 Original definition: Write down the numbers from 3 to infinity. Take next number, M say, that has not been crossed off. Counting through the numbers that have not yet been crossed off after that M, cross off every 4th term. Repeat, always crossing off every 4th term of those that remain. The numbers that are left form the sequence.
%C A100585 Can be stated as the number of animals starting from a single trio if any trio of animals can produce a single offspring. See A061418 for the equivalent sequence for pairs of animals. - _Luca Khan_, Sep 05 2024
