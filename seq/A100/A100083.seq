%N A100083 Numbers n such that n divides Sum_{m=1..n} (m+1)!.
%C A100083 n | Sum_{m=1..n} (m+1)! => n | Sum_{m=2..n+1} m! => n | Sum_{m=2..n-1} m! for n>2 => Sum_{m=2..n-1+k} m! == 0 (mod n) for all k>=0. If n is present and even, then n/2 is present. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Nov 11 2004
%C A100083 The terms occur in groups of 4, in a series of n, 2n, 4n, and 8n. Is there any way of calculating the next term in the reduced series: 1, 31, 373, 11563? - _Harvey P. Dale_, Jun 11 2013
%C A100083 If n is in the sequence and k|n, then k is also in the sequence. In the other direction, if s and t is in the sequence and gcd(s,t)=1, then n=s*t is also in the sequence. Therefore, we need to check only the prime powers, after which we can easily build the rest of the sequence. The prime powers in the sequence begin with 2, 4, 8, 31, 373, ... - _Robert Gerbicz_, Jun 11 2013
%C A100083 For any terms in this sequence, their LCM also belongs to this sequence. If a(17) exists, it is prime. - _Max Alekseyev_, Jun 11 2013

%F A100083 Numbers n such that n | (A007489(n+1)-1), also n | (A003422(n+2)-2), n | A054116(n+1).
%e A100083 The first few partial sums of (m+1)!, starting with m=1 are 2, 8, 32, 152, 872, 5912, 46232, 409112. Of these, 2 is divisible by 1; 8 is divisible by 2; 152 is divisible by 4; but 32 is not divisible by 3. Therefore the first few terms of this sequence are 1, 2, 4.
