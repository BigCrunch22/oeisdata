%N A100710 Characterized by a(n) XOR (a(n) + 1) = a(n) - n.
%C A100710 a(n) is obtained by "adding 1 to the part of the binary expansion of n-1 to the left of the least significant 0". For example, to work out a(92) first write 91 in binary: 1011011. The part to the left of the least significant 0 is 1011 (eleven) and when we add 1 we get 1100 (twelve). Thus a(92) in binary is 1100011, so a(92)=99. This makes it clear that the map "n goes to a(n)" is a bijection from the positive integers to the positive integers without 1, 3, 7, 15, 31 etc.
%F A100710 a(n) = 2*A006519(n) + n - 1.
