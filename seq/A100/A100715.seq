%N A100715 Pseudoperfect (or semiperfect) k-brilliant numbers for some k>1: some set of proper divisors of a(n) sums to a(n) and a(n) = p(1)p(2)...p(m) for primes all with the same number of digits.
%C A100715 Since every multiple of a semiperfect number is semiperfect, there are an infinite number of values in this sequence and also an infinite number of values in the complement (pseudoperfect or semiperfect numbers which are not k-brilliant numbers).
