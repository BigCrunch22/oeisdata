%C A100113 a(A100112(n)) and A100114(A100112(n)) define a pair of inverse permutations of the squarefree numbers: a(A100112(A100114(n))) = A100114(A100112(a(n))) = A005117(n);
%C A100113 A100115(n) = if n is squarefree then a(A100112(n)), otherwise n.
%C A100113 Comments from _N. J. A. Sloane_, Oct 29 2020: (Start)
%C A100113 An alternative definition is that this is the lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive squarefree numbers with the property that gcd(a(n), a(n-1)) > 1 for n >= 3.
%C A100113 Described in this way, this is a squarefree version of the EKG sequence A064413, and it is easy to modify the proof that that sequence is a permutation of the positive integers so as to show that the present sequence is a permutation of the positive squarefree numbers, as claimed in the first comment.
%C A100113 Conjecture: With the three exceptions p = 2, 5, 13, and 31, when a prime p appears it is preceded by 2*p and followed by 3*p.
