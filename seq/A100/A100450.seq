%N A100450 Number of ordered triples (i,j,k) with |i| + |j| + |k| <= n and gcd(i,j,k) <= 1.
%C A100450 Note that gcd(0,m) = m for any m.
%C A100450 I would also like to get the sequences of the numbers of distinct sums i+j+k (also distinct products i*j*k) over all ordered triples (i,j,k) with |i| + |j| + |k| <= n; also over all ordered triples (i,j,k) with |i| + |j| + |k| <= n and gcd(i,j,k) <= 1.
%C A100450 Also the sequences of the numbers of distinct sums i+j+k (also distinct products i*j*k) over all ordered triples (i,j,k) with i >= 0, j >= 0, k >= 0 and i + j + k = n; also over all ordered triples (i,j,k) with i >= 0, j >= 0, k >= 0, i + j + k = n and gcd(i,j,k) <= 1.
%C A100450 Also the number of ordered triples (i,j,k) with i >= 0, j >= 0, k >= 0, i + j + k = n and gcd(i,j,k) <= 1.
%C A100450 From _Robert Price_, Mar 05 2013: (Start)
%C A100450 The sequences that address the previous comments are:
%C A100450 Distinct sums i+j+k with or without the GCD qualifier results in a(n)=2n+1 (A005408).
%C A100450 Distinct products i*j*k without the GCD qualifier is given by A213207.
%C A100450 Distinct products i*j*k with    the GCD qualifier is given by A213208.
%C A100450 With the restriction i,j,k >= 0 ...
%C A100450   Distinct sums or products equal to n is trivial and always equals one (A000012).
%C A100450   Distinct sums <= n results in a(n)=n (A001477).
%C A100450   Distinct products <= n without the GCD qualifier is given by A213213.
%C A100450   Distinct products <= n with    the GCD qualifier is given by A213212.
%C A100450   Ordered triples with sum = n  without the GCD qualifier is A000217(n+1).
%C A100450   Ordered triples with sum = n  with    the GCD qualifier is A048240.
%C A100450   Ordered triples with sum <= n without the GCD qualifier is A000292.
%C A100450   Ordered triples with sum <= n with    the GCD qualifier is A048241. (End)
%C A100450 This sequence (A100450) without the GCD qualifier results in A001845. - _Robert Price_, Jun 04 2013

[Sketch of proof: Let b(n) = number of ordered triples (i, j, k) with |i| + |j| + |k| = n and gcd(i, j, k) <= 1. Then a(n) = A100450(n) = partial sums of b(n) and Sum_{d divides n} b(d) = 4*n^2+2 = A005899(n) with g.f. ((1+x)/(1-x))^3.]
