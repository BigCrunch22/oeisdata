%N A100921 n appears A023416(n) times (appearances equal number of 0-bits).
%F A100921 Sum_{n>=1} (-1)^(n+1)/a(n) = Sum_{n>=1} (-1)^(n+1)/A059009(n) = 0.395592509... . - _Amiram Eldar_, Feb 18 2024
%e A100921 The binary representation of 16 is 10000, which has four 0-bits (and one 1-bit), hence 16 appears four times in this sequence (but only once in A100922).
