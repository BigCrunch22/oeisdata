%N A100822 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of deco polyominoes of height n with k cells in the first column. (A deco polyomino is a directed column-convex polyomino in which the height, measured along the diagonal, is attained only in the last column).
%C A100822 Row n has n terms. Rows are circular permutations of the rows of A054115. Column 1 and row sums yield A000142 (the factorial numbers). Column 2 yields A059171.
%C A100822 T(n+1,n)=A007489(n).

%F A100822 T(n, k)=sum((n-j)!, j=1..k) for 1<=k<n; T(n, n)=1.
%F A100822 T(n,k)=T(n-1,k-1)+(n-1)! for k<n; T(n,n)=1.

%e A100822 24,30,32,33,1;
%e A100822 T(2,1)=T(2,2)=1 because the deco polyominoes of height 2 are the horizontal and vertical dominoes, having, respectively, 1 and 2 cells in their first columns.
