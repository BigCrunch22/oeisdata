%N A100591 Least positive integer that can be represented as sum of semiprime and a triangular number in exactly n ways. Triangular numbers include t(0)=0 and (1)=1.
%C A100591 Computed by Ray Chandler.
%F A100591 a(n) = min(i such that i = A001358(j) + A000217(k) in n ways).
%e A100591 a(0) = 1 because 1 is the smallest positive integer that cannot be represented as sum of semiprime and a triangular number (since 4 is the smallest semiprime). a(1) = 4 because 4 is the smallest such sum, namely semiprime(1)=4 + t(0)=0. Similarly a(2) = 7 because 7 = 4 + 3 and 7 = 6 + 1, where 4 and 6 are semiprimes, 3 and 1 are triangular.
