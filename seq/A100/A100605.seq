%N A100605 Numbers k such that (prime(k)-1)! + prime(k)^2 is prime.
%C A100605 k = {1, 2, 4, 10, 26} yields primes p(k) = {2, 3, 7, 29, 101}. There are no more such k up to k=100. Verified by Ray Chandler.
%C A100605 a(6) > 750. - _Jinyuan Wang_, Apr 10 2020
%F A100605 Numbers k such that (prime(k)-1)! + prime(k)^2 is prime, where prime(k) is the k-th prime.
%e A100605 a(3) = 4 because (prime(4)-1)! + prime(4)^2 = (7-1)! + 7^2 = 720 + 49 = 769 is prime and is the 3rd such prime of that form.
