%N A100793 Beginning with 1, least natural number such that sum as well the difference of successive terms are both palindromes, otherwise 0 if no such term exists.
%e A100793 a(6)=105 since 105 + 6 = 111 and 105 - 6 = 99 both are palindromes and 105 is the least unused natural number for which this is true.
%e A100793 a(34)=a(58)=a(69)=0 since no unused natural numbers exist.
