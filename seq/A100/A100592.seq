%N A100592 Least positive integer that can be represented as the sum of exactly two semiprimes in exactly n ways.
%C A100592 A072931(a(n)) = n and A072931(m) < n for m < a(n). [From _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Jan 21 2010]

%F A100592 a(n) = min{i such that i = A001358(j) + A001358(k) in n ways}.
%e A100592 a(0) = 1 because 1 is the smallest positive integer that cannot be represented as sum of two semiprimes (since 4 is the smallest semiprime). a(1) = 8 because 8 is the smallest such sum of two semiprimes: 4 + 4. Similarly a(2) = 18 because 18 = 14 + 4 = 9 + 9 where {4,9,14} are semiprimes and there is no third such sum for 18.
