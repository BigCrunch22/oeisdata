%N A100283 a(n) = floor(p*(n+1)) - floor(p*(n)) - 1 where p = Padovan plastic number = 1.324718... (cf. A060006).
%C A100283 A rabbit-like sequence generated by the Padovan plastic number.
%C A100283 The well-known rabbit sequence is generated by taking the difference between the nearest integer less than phi*(n+1) minus the nearest integer less than phi*(n). If this value is 2, then the n-th rabbit sequence value is one. If this value is 1, the n-th rabbit sequence is 0. The sequence given is calculated in a similar manner, but using the plastic constant = 1.324717957244... instead of phi = 1.618033... = (1+sqrt(5))/2. It is 0001 followed by 11 copies of 001 followed by 0001 followed by 12 copies of 001 followed by 11 copies of 001 followed by similar patterns of 0001 followed by n copies of 001 where n is 11 or 12.
