%N A100011 Iterated hyperdodecahedron numbers, starting with hyperdodecahedron(2) = 600. The hyperdodecahedron numbers are 4-dimensional figurate numbers based on the 120-cell regular polytope, also known as the hecatonicosachoron or hyperdodecahedron. This sequence is hyperdodecahedron(2), hyperdodecahedron(hyperdodecahedron(2)) and so on recursively.
%C A100011 This need not start at hyperdodecahedron(2) = 600. For example, starting at a(0) = 33, which is not a hyperdodecahedron number, we have a(1) = hyperdodecahedron(33) = 33*((261*33^3)-(504*33^2)+(283*33)-38)/2 = 145860033; a(2) = hyperdodecahedron(hyperdodecahedron(33)) = hyperdodecahedron(145860033) = 59068471906029484694371097524860033.

%F A100011 a(0) = 2. hyperdodecahedron(n) = n*((261*n^3)-(504*n^2)+(283*n)-38)/2. a(1) = hyperdodecahedron(2) = 600. For k>0, we have the recurrence: a(k+1) = hyperdodecahedron(a(k))) = a(k)*((261*a(k)^3)-(504*a(k)^2)+(283*a(k))-38)/2.
%e A100011 a(2) = 16858418928600 because a(0) = 2 is the seed for this instance of the more general recurrence; a(1) = hyperdodecahedron(2) = 600;
%e A100011 a(2) = hyperdodecahedron(hyperdodecahedron(2)) = hyperdodecahedron(600) = 600*((261*600^3)-(504*600^2)+(283*600)-38)/2 = 16858418928600.
