%N A100952 Numbers that cannot be written as p*q+r with three distinct primes p, q and r.
%C A100952 A100951(a(n)) = 0;
%C A100952 Conjecture: the sequence is complete.
%C A100952 A weaker conjecture: every integer greater than 60 (or some larger value based on further search) may be partitioned into a prime p and a semiprime qr, where the prime p is bounded by log(min(q,r)). Chen (1978) showed that all sufficiently large even numbers are the sum of a prime and the product of at most two primes. Zumkeller's conjecture effectively extends this from "even" to both even and odd integers. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Nov 25 2004
%C A100952 Conjecture: Every positive integer can be represented as p*q-r with distinct primes p, q, r. - _Zak Seidov_, Aug 28 2012

%e A100952 A100949(60) = #{11+7*7, 5+5*11, 3+3*19, 2+2*29} = 4, but A100951(60) = 0 as in each partition only 2 primes are used, therefore 60 is a term.
