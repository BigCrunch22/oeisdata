%N A100570 Numbers that are not the sum of a square and a semiprime.
%C A100570 No others up to 300000. Computed in collaboration with _Ray Chandler_. It appears that this sequence is finite, that is, that almost every positive integer is the sum of a semiprime and a square number. There are probably no further exceptions after a(12)=657.
%C A100570 The statement about the finiteness of this sequence (namely, a(n)<=657) is much stronger than the Goldbach binary conjecture. Indeed, a much weaker conjecture, that this sequence contains no perfect squares >1, already implies the Goldbach conjecture. Cf. comment in A241922. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, May 01 2014
%C A100570 From _Daniel Mikhail_, Nov 23 2020: (Start)
%C A100570 There are no new terms in this sequence between 658 and 2^28.
%C A100570 Notably, A014090 (numbers that are not the sum of a square and one prime) is a known infinite sequence. (End)

%F A100570 An integer is not an element for any integers i, j of the pairwise sum of {A001358(i)} and {A000290(j)}.
%e A100570 From _Daniel Mikhail_, Nov 23 2020: (Start)
%e A100570 An integer m is in this set if, for any primes, p and q, there does not exist a natural k, such that m-k^2 = p*q.
%e A100570 Consider m=12 and all k such that k^2 < 12: k is either 0,1,4, or 9.
%e A100570   12 - 0 = 12 = 2*2*2*3 => not semiprime;
%e A100570   12 - 1 = 11 => not semiprime;
%e A100570   12 - 4 = 8 = 2*2*2 => not semiprime;
%e A100570   12 - 9 = 3 => not semiprime.
%e A100570 Therefore, 12 is a term. (End)
