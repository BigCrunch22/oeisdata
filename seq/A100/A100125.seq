%N A100125 Decimal expansion of Sum_{n>0} n/(2^(n^2)).
%C A100125 This number is obviously 2-dense, but not 2-normal: any finite binary string s representing the value N will appear in its digits, not later than those added by the term N/2^(N^2), but nonzero digits have density zero since the gap between those added by subsequent terms is increasing much faster (~ n) than the maximal possible number of new nonzero digits (~ log_2(n)). - _M.
