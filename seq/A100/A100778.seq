%N A100778 Integer powers of primorial numbers.
%C A100778 Smallest squarefree numbers or their powers with distinct prime signatures. Or least numbers with prime signatures (p*q*r*...)^k, where p,q,r,... are primes and k is a whole number.
%C A100778 Also Heinz numbers of uniform integer partitions whose union is an initial interval of positive integers. An integer partition is uniform if all parts appear with the same multiplicity. The Heinz number of an integer partition (y_1, ..., y_k) is prime(y_1) * ... * prime(y_k). The sequence of all uniform integer partitions whose Heinz numbers belong to the sequence begins: (1), (11), (12), (111), (1111), (123), (11111), (1122), (111111), (1111111), (1234), (111222), (11111111), (111111111), (112233), (1111111111). - _Gus Wiseman_, Dec 26 2018

%C A100778 Intersection of A025487 and A072774.
%C A100778 The distinct terms of A046523(A072774(n)) in ascending orders.
%C A100778 The k-th power of the n-th primorial number, A002110(n)^k, has (k+1)^n divisors which are the set of the (k+1)-free prime(n)-smooth numbers. (End)

%e A100778 10 is not a term as 6 is a member with the same prime signature 10 > 6.
%e A100778 216 is a term as 216 = (2*3)^3. 243 is not a term as 32 represents that prime signature.
