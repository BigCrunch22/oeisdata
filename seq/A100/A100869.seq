%N A100869 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = minimal sum of denominators needed to write k/n (for 1 <= k <= n with gcd(k,n) = 1) as a sum of unit fractions, where k/n is in lowest terms.

%e A100869 4 6
%e A100869 5 18 12 17
%e A100869 T(5,2) = 18 because the minimal sum of unit fractions is 2/5 = 1/3 + 1/15 and 3+15=18.
