%N A343922 The largest positive number that can be added to n the maximum number of times, see A343921(n), such that the digits in each resulting sum are distinct, or -1 if no such number exists.
%F A343922 a(n) = -1 for n >= 9876543210.
%e A343922 a(0) = 27 as 27 can be added to 0 a total of A343921(0) = 36 times with each sum containing distinct digits. The 36 sums are 27, 54, 81, 108, 135, ..., 918, 945, 972. No other positive number can be added 36 or more times to 0 to produce such sums.
%e A343922 a(1) = 7012 as 7012 can be added to 1 a total of A343921(1) = 9 times with each sum containing distinct digits. The sums are 7013, 14025, 21037, 28049, 35061, 42073, 49085, 56097, 63109. There are fourteen positive numbers in all which can be added to 1 a total of 9 times producing sums with distinct digits, the smallest being 1 (see A338659).
%e A343922 a(47) = 9111 as 9111 can be added to 47 a total of A343921(47) = 9 times with each sum containing distinct digits. The sums are 9158, 18269, 27380, 36491, 45602, 54713, 63824, 72935, 82046. There are five positive numbers in all which can be added to 47 a total of 9 times producing sums with distinct digits, the smallest being 3 (see A338659).
