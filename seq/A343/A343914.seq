%N A343914 Riesel problem in base 3: a(n) is the smallest k >= 0 such that (2*n)*3^k-1 is prime, or -1 if no such k exists.
%C A343914 31532322469 (A273987(3)/2) is the smallest n such that a(n) = -1.

%e A343914 For n = 11: (2*11)*3^k-1 is prime for k = 2, with 2 being the smallest such k, so a(11) = 2.
%o A343914 (PARI) a(n) = for(k=0, oo, if(ispseudoprime((2*n)*3^k-1), return(k)))
