%N A343640 Coordinate triples (x(n), y(n), z(n); n >= 0) of the 3D square spiral filling space with shells of increasing radius for the sup-norm, in turn filled by squares extending from one pole to the opposite one.
%C A343640 This is a 3D generalization of the 2D square spiral and could be used to produce a 3D variant of Ulam's prime spiral.
%C A343640 See A343630 for an analog using the Euclidean or 2-norm instead of the sup- or oo-norm used here, so points are partitioned in spheres and circles instead of squares and cubes here.
%C A343640 The integer lattice points, Z^3, are listed in order of increasing sup norm R = max(|x|, |y|, |z|). Each "sphere" or shell of given radius R is filled starting at the North or South pole using concentric squares on the top and bottom face and squares of fixed size (2R+1) X (2R+1) at intermediate z-coordinates. Each square (circle for the sup-norm) is filled in the sense of increasing longitude, where the positive x axis corresponds to longitude 0, i.e., the points (r,0,z), (0,r,z), (-r,0,z) and (0,-r,z) are visited in this order. The z-values are alternatively increasing and decreasing (so over a period of two shells they follow the same rectangle-wave shape as the x-values do over the period of each square).
%C A343640 The sequence can be seen as a table with row length of 3, where each row corresponds to the (x,y,z)-coordinates of one point (then the three columns are A343641, A343642 and A343643), or as a table with row lengths 3*A010014, where A010014(r) is the number of points with sup-norm r.
%C A343640 There are (2n+1)^3 integer lattice points with sup norm <= n. Therefore, the point number n (where 0 is the origin) is in the shell r = round(n^(1/3)/2) = floor(...+1/2). Within shell r, which starts with the point number (2r-1)^3 (except for r=0), the first and last (2r+1)^2 points are on square spirals on the top and bottom faces, and the other points are on 2r-1 squares forming "belts" of 8r points each, on the side faces of the cube.

%e A343640 Shell r = 0 is the origin, {(0,0,0)}.
%e A343640 Shell r = 1 contains the 3*3 + 4*2 + 3*3 = 26 points with oo-norm 1, i.e., all points with coordinates within {-1, 0, 1} except for the origin. They are listed in a square spiral starting at the North Pole: (0,0,1), (1,0,1), (1,1,1), (0,1,1), (-1,1,1), (-1,0,1), (-1,-1,1), (0,-1,1), (1,-1,1); then on the equator:  (1,0,0), (1,1,0), (0,1,0), (-1,1,0), (-1,0,0), (-1,-1,0), (0,-1,0), (1,-1,0), and then on the South face using an inward spiral: (1,0,-1), (1,1,-1), (0,1,-1), (-1,1,-1), (-1,0,-1), (-1,-1,-1), (0,-1,-1), (1,-1,-1), (0,0,-1).
%e A343640 Since there are no empty shells, the z-coordinate is always increasing for even r and decreasing for odd r.
