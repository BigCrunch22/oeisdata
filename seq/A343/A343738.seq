%N A343738 a(n) is the smallest prime p > k such that p + k is a power of 2, where k = 2*n - 1, or 0 if no such prime exists.
%C A343738 k = 2*n-1 is the n-th odd number; p is the smallest prime > k such that p+k is a power of 2. If the constraint "> k" were removed, sequence A096822 would result.
%e A343738 For n=1, k = 2*n-1 = 1, and the smallest prime p > 1 such that p+1 is a power of 2 is 3, so a(1)=3.
%e A343738 For n=3, k=5, and the smallest prime p > 5 such that p+5 is a power of 2 is 11, so a(3)=11.
%e A343738 For n=4, k=7, and there is no prime in the sequence {2^4 - 7 = 9, 2^5 - 7 = 25, 2^6 - 7 = 57, ...} until 2^39 - 7 = 549755813881, so a(4) = 549755813881.
%e A343738 For n=55, k=109, and the smallest prime p > 109 such that p+109 is a prime is a(55) = 2^963 - 109 (a 290-digit number).
