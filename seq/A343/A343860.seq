%N A343860 For the numbers k that can be expressed as k = w+x = y*z with w*x = (y+z)^2 where w, x, y, and z are all positive integers, this sequence gives the corresponding values of y+z.
%C A343860 A057369 lists numbers m such that two quadratic equations of the form t^2-k*t+m = 0 and t^2-m*t+k^2 = 0 have positive integer roots, where k is the coefficient of t and m is the constant in first equation, which has roots p and q (i.e., k, m, p, q are all positive integer, k=p+q and m=p*q). Also m is the coefficient of t and k^2 is the constant in second equation, which has roots u and v (i.e., k, m, u, v are all positive integer, m=u+v and k^2=u*v). Sequence [a(n)] represents corresponding values of k=p+q for A057369(m).

%e A343860 t^2 - (3+15)*t + 3*15 = 0 has roots p=3 and q=15, and
%e A343860 t^2 - (9+36)*t + 9*36 = 0 has roots u=9 and v=36, and
%e A343860 3*15 = 9+36 and (3+15)^2 = 9*36, so k = 3+15 = 18 is a term of this sequence.
