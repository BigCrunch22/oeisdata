%N A343974 Even numbers k such that the two sets of primes in the Goldbach representation of k and k+2 as the sum of two odd primes do not intersect.
%C A343974 k is in the sequence iff the Goldbach representation of k as the sum of two odd primes does not contain any prime that is the lesser of a twin prime (A001359).
%C A343974 Conjecture: a(n) is congruent to 2 mod 6 with a(n)-3 not prime.

%e A343974 The Goldbach representations of 80 and 82 as the sum of two odd primes are:
%e A343974 {{73, 7}, {67, 13}, {61, 19}, {43, 37}} and {{79, 3}, {71, 11}, {59, 23}, {53, 29}, {41, 41}}. The two sets {7, 13, 19, 37, 43, 61, 67, 73} and {3, 11, 23, 29, 41, 53, 59, 71, 79} do not intersect, so 80 is a term of the sequence.
