%N A343733 Primes p at which tau(p^p) is a prime power, where tau is the number-of-divisors function A000005.
%C A343733 For every prime p, p^p has p+1 divisors. p=2 is a term, but for all odd primes, p+1 is even, so this sequence consists of 2 and the primes of the form 2^j - 1, i.e., 2 and the Mersenne primes (A000668).
%e A343733 2^2 has 3 = 3^1 divisors, so 2 is a term.
%e A343733 3^3 has 4 = 2^2 divisors, so 3 is a term.
%e A343733 5^5 has 6 = 2*3 divisors, so 5 is not a term.
%Y A343733 Cf. A000005, A000668, A000312, A062319.
