%N A343608 a(n) = [n/5]*[n/5 - 1]*(3n - 10[n/5 + 1])/6, where [.] = floor: upper bound for minimum number of monochromatic triangles in a 3-edge-colored complete graph K_n.
%C A343608 Consider the complete graph K_n whose n(n-1)/2 edges are colored with 3 distinct colors as to minimize the number of monochromatic triangles, i.e., subgraphs isomorphic to K_3 having all edges of the same color.
%C A343608 Cummings et al. show that this minimum number of monochromatic triangles M_3(K_3,n) is given by a(n) for sufficiently large n.
%C A343608 For the actual minimum numbers, we currently only know M_3(K_3,n) = 0 for n < 17, and M_3(K_3, 17) = 5.
%C A343608 Known examples for n>17, where the actual minimum value is below this upper bound: M_3(K_3, 18) <= 10 < 14 = a(18), M_3(K_3, 19) <= 15 < 17 = a(19), M_3(K_3, 21) <= 25 < 26 = a(21). For n>21, the current best known minimum values match the upper bound. - _Dmitry Kamenetsky_, Jul 01 2021

%F A343608 a(n) = A144679(n-11) = r*A000292(q-1) + (5-r)*A000292(q-2) = q(q - 1)(n + 2r - 10)/6, where A000292(q-2) = binomial(q,3), r = n mod 5 and q = (n-r)/5, for sufficiently large n, according to Cummings et al., Corollary 3.
%e A343608 a(17) = [17/5]*[17/5 - 1]*(3*17 - 10[17/5 + 1])/6 = 3*2*11/6 = 11, which is the number of monochromatic triangles obtained by coloring the edges of the complete graph K_17 as follows: edges (i,j) with mod(j-i,5) in {1,4} get color 1, edges (i,j) with mod(j-i,5) in {2,3} get color 2, and edges (i,j) with mod(j-i,5) = 0 get color 3.  The minimum number of monochromatic triangles in an edge-coloring of K_17 with 3 colors turns out to be 5 <= 11.
