%N A343816 a(n) is the least start of exactly n consecutive odd numbers that are cyclic numbers (A003277).
%C A343816 The sequence is restricted to odd cyclic numbers since 2 is the only even cyclic number.
%C A343816 This sequence is finite, with 8 terms; any run of 9 consecutive odd numbers will contain a multiple of 9, and this multiple of 9 cannot be cyclic. - _RÃ©my Sigrist_, May 10 2021
%e A343816 a(1) = 23 since 23 is cyclic, but 21 and 25 are not.
%e A343816 a(2) = 41 since 41 and 43 are cyclic, but 39 and 45 are not.
