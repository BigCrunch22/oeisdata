%N A343697 a(n) is the number of preference profiles in the stable marriage problem with n men and n women such that both the men's and women's profiles form Latin squares.
%C A343697 Equivalently, these are the profiles where each woman is ranked differently by the n men and each man is ranked differently by the women.
%C A343697 The men-proposing Gale-Shapley algorithm on such a set of preferences ends in one round, since every woman receives one proposal in the first round. Similarly, the women-proposing Gale-Shapley algorithm ends in one round.

%F A343697 a(n) = A002860(n)^2.
%e A343697 There are 12 Latin squares of order 3, where 12 = A002860(3). Thus, for n = 3, there are A002860(3) ways to set up the men's profiles and A002860(3) ways to set up the women's profiles, making A002860(3)^2 = 144 ways to set up all the preference profiles.
