%N A343973 Primes p such that both p-1 and p+1 are in A093641.
%C A343973 Primes p such that p-1 and p+1 each have at most one odd prime factor (counted with multiplicity).
%C A343973 Terms > 3 must be either of the form 3*2^k+1 with 3*2^(k-1)+1 prime, or of the form 3*2^k-1 with 3*2^(k-1)-1 prime.
%C A343973 There are no more terms up to 3*2^5000+1.
%C A343973 Conjecture: these are all the terms.
%e A343973 a(5) = 11 is a term because 11-1=5*2^1 and 11+1=3*2^2 with 11, 5 and 3 prime.
