%N A343417 a(n) is the number of free polyominoes with k cells and n-k distinguished vertices.
%C A343417 This sequence counts "free" polyominoes where holes are allowed. This means that two polyominoes are considered the same if one is a rigid transformation (translation, rotation, reflection or glide reflection) of the other.
%C A343417 A000105(n) <= a(n) <= A343577(n).
%C A343417 For an ordinary, asymmetrical polyomino, the number of free polyominoes with d distinguished cells is equal to C(v,d), where v is the number of vertices of the polyomino, and C is the binomial coefficient (A007318). - _John Mason_, Mar 11 2022
