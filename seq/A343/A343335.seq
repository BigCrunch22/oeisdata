%N A343335 a(n) is the smallest proper alternating multiple of n when n is not a multiple of 20, otherwise a(20*k) = 0 for k >= 1.
%C A343335 Every positive integer that is not multiple of 20 is called an alternator (A110303) because it has a multiple in which parity of the decimal digits alternates (see link) and that is called an alternating integer (A030141).
%C A343335 If n is an alternator, n <> 20*k, k>=1, then a(n) is the smallest alternating multiple k*n, with k > 1.
%C A343335 If n is congruent to 0 mod 20, a(n) is set to zero to indicate that n is not an alternator.
%C A343335 This sequence is a variant of A110304, but here the smallest alternating multiple of n cannot be n, when n is an alternating integer.

%e A343335 For n = 13, 2 * 13 = 26, 3 * 13 = 39, 4 * 13 = 52 that is alternating, so, a(13) = 52.
