%N A343961 a(n) is the number of Johnson solids of unit edge length with a volume V such that n <= V < n+1.
%C A343961 a(n) = 0 for n > 92.
%H A343961 Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Johnson_solids">List of Johnson solids</a>
%e A343961 For n = 6: The Johnson solids with volumes V with 6 <= V < 7 are J_6, J_19 and J_23 with V ~ 6.21, 6.77 and 6.92, respectively, so a(6) = 3.
