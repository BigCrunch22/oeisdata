%N A343103 a(n) is the sum of the number of times each digit in n (taken with repetition) has appeared in the sequence.
%C A343103 The fixed points > 0 in the first one million terms are 10, 101, 194. It is likely no more exist.
%H A343103 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A343103/a343103.png">Image of the terms for n=0..1000000</a>. The green line is a(n) = n.
%e A343103 a(0) to a(9) = 0 as the digits 0 to 9 have not appeared in the sequence.
%e A343103 a(10) = 10 as 1 has appeared zero times and 0 has appeared ten times, thus a(10) = 0 + 10 = 10.
%e A343103 a(11) = 2 as 1 has appeared once in the sequence, and as 1 appears twice in 11, a(11) = 1 + 1 = 2.
%e A343103 a(12) = 2 as 1 has appeared twice and 2 has appeared zero times, thus a(12) = 2 + 0 = 2.
%e A343103 a(20) = 19 as 2 has appeared eight times and 0 has appeared eleven times, thus a(20) = 8 + 11 = 19.
%e A343103 a(22) = 16 as 2 has appeared eight times in the sequence, and as 2 appears twice in 22, a(22) = 8 + 8 = 16.
