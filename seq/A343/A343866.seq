%N A343866 Number of inequivalent cyclic diagonal Latin squares of order 2n+1 up to rotations, reflections and permutation of symbols.
%C A343866 Also the number of main classes of diagonal Latin squares of order 2n+1 that contain a cyclic Latin square. Compare A341585.
%F A343866 a((p-1)/2) = A341585((p-1)/2) for odd prime p.
%e A343866 a(12) = 3 since there are A123565(25) = 10 cyclic diagonal Latin squares whose first row is in ascending order. Each of these is uniquely defined by the step between rows and form 5 pairs by horizontal or vertical reflection (negating the step between rows). Up to exchanging rows with columns there are 3 distinct classes, so a(12) = 3.
