%N A343458 Distinct values of the least common multiple of initial segments of numbers of least prime signature (A025487).
%C A343458 The least common multiple of all numbers of least prime signature (A025487) <= c equals the least common multiple of all primorial powers (A100778) <= c, where c is an arbitrary positive real number.
%C A343458 The terms of this sequence are themselves numbers of least prime signature. Write a(n) in its prime factorization, Product_{i=1..k} A000040(i)^e_i. Then e_i is approximately proportional to 1/log_2(A002110(i)).
%C A343458 More precisely, the least common multiple of all numbers of least prime signature (A025487) <= c has prime factorization Product_{i>=1} A000040(i)^e_i, where e_i = floor(log(c)/log(A002110(i))).

%F A343458 a(1) = 1, a(n) = lcm(a(n-1), A100778(n)) for n >= 2. - _David A. Corneth_, Apr 18 2021
%e A343458 The least common multiple of the numbers of least prime signature up through 36 is equal to the least common multiple of all primorial powers up through 36, including 2^5 = 32, 6^2 = 36, and 30^1 = 30. Thus 2^5 * 3^2 * 5 = 1440 is a term of this sequence.
