%N A343696 a(n) is the number of preference profiles in the stable marriage problem with n men and n women, such that the men's preference profiles form a Latin square.
%C A343696 Equivalently, these are the profiles where each woman is ranked differently by the n men.
%C A343696 Equivalently, for every rank i, there is exactly one woman who is ranked i by a given man.
%C A343696 The men-proposing Gale-Shapley algorithm on such a set of preferences ends in one round, since every woman receives one proposal in the first round.
%C A343696 Due to symmetry, a(n) is the number of preference profiles in the stable marriage problem with n men and n women, such that the womenâ€™s preference profiles form a Latin square.

%F A343696 a(n) = n!^n * A002860(n).
%e A343696 For n = 3, there are 3!^3 ways to set up the women's preference profiles and A002860(3) ways to set up the men's preference profiles, where A002860(3) = 12 (there are 12 different Latin squares of order 3). Thus a(3) = 3!^3 * A002860(3) = 216 * 12 = 2592.
