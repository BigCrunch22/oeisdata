%N A343476 Numbers k whose representations in factorial base include each of the digits from 0 to d-1 exactly once, where d = A084558(k) is the number of digits of k in factorial base.
%C A343476 The number of terms with k > 1 digits in factorial base is 2^(k-1) - 1 = A000225(k-1).
%C A343476 The number of terms below k!, for k >= 1, is 2^(k-1) - (k-1) = A000325(k-1).
