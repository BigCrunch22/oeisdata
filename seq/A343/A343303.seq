%N A343303 Numbers in A231626 but not in A343302; first of 5 consecutive deficient numbers in arithmetic progression with common difference > 1.
%C A343303 Numbers k such that k, k+d, k+2*d, k+3*d and k+4*d are consecutive deficient numbers with some d > 1. Such k with d = 1 are listed in A343302.
%C A343303 All known terms have d = 2. If some k is the start of 5 consecutive deficient numbers in arithmetic progression with common difference 3, then k+1, k+4, k+7 and k+10 must be 4 consecutive terms in A096399. This may happen, but each of such k has to be extremely large.
%C A343303 If k is an even term here, then none of k, k+d, k+2*d, k+3*d and k+4*d is divisible by 6, so d must be divisible by 3.
%C A343303 It seems that most terms are congruent to 5 modulo 6. The smallest term congruent to 1 modulo 6 is a(6) = 2989, and the smallest term congruent to 3 modulo 6 is a(22) = 9723.

%e A343303 347 is here since it is the start of 5 consecutive deficient numbers in arithmetic progression with common difference 2, namely 347, 349, 351, 353 and 355. Indeed, all of 348, 350, 352 and 354 are abundant.
