%N A343330 a(n) is the largest odd positive integer that is abundant and has the same prime signature as A279537(n) or 0 if no such integer exists.
%C A343330 Odd abundant numbers k have omega(k) >= 3. The zeros in this sequence come from numbers k having omega(k) < 3 in which case no positive integer with that prime signature exists.
%C A343330 Numbers with omega(k) > 3 are excluded by definition as most such numbers have infinitely many cases for that prime signature in which case no largest element exists.
%e A343330 a(17) = 945 as A279537(17) = 120 = 2^(3) * 3^(1) * 5^(1) and has prime signature (3, 1, 1). The largest odd positive integer that has prime signature (3, 1, 1) and is abundant is 945.
