%N A343162 The number of graphs on n nodes that can be isometrically embedded in a Hamming graph.

%C A343162 Peter Winkler (1984) found a very nice way to decide whether a given graph can be isometrically embedded into a Hamming graph. He discovered that such an embedding is actually unique, when it exists.
%C A343162 Sequence A343463 and A343464 are about graphs that are embeddable as INDUCED subgraphs. The two concepts are quite distinct. Today I may have discovered for the first time the (unique) smallest graph that proves the distinction. This is the six-node graph:
%C A343162 *        .  --  .
%C A343162 *      / |      | \
%C A343162 *    .   |      |   .
%C A343162 *      \ |      | /
%C A343162 *        .  --  .
%C A343162 This graph cannot be isometrically embedded in a Hamming graph. But it is an induced subgraph:
%C A343162 *       10  --  11
%C A343162 *      / |      | \
%C A343162 *    00  |      |  31
%C A343162 *      \ |      | /
%C A343162 *       20  --  21
%C A343162 Sequence A343168 is a triangular array that gives the number of graphs on n vertices that are isometrically embeddable in the Hamming graph H(n,k). The present sequence gives the row sums of this triangle, and is a direct analog of A343463. The present sequence and A343463 agree up to n=5, and the graph above is the first difference between them. (End)
