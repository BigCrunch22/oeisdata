%N A343329 a(n) is the largest positive integer that is abundant and has the same prime signature as A025610(n) or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A343329 a(n) = 0 if A025487(n) is a power of 2 or A025487(n) = 6.
%e A343329 a(6) = 20 as A025610(6) = 12 and has prime signature (1, 2) as it is 2^(2) * 3^(1). The largest abundant number with prime signature (1, 2) is 20 = 2^(2) * 5^(1).
