%N A343630 Coordinate triples (x(n), y(n), z(n); n >= 0) of the 3D spiral filling space with shells of increasing radius, using circles at fixed z-values which alternatingly move up and down as do the x-values.
%C A343630 This is a 3D generalization of a plane filling spiral using the Euclidean norm.
%C A343630 See A343640 for an analog using the sup- or oo-norm, where circles are squares and spheres are cubes.
%C A343630 The integer lattice points, Z^3, are listed in order of increasing Euclidean distance R^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 from the origin. Each shell of given radius is filled using circles located at given latitude (i.e., z-value) on the sphere, and each circle is filled by points with increasing longitude, where the positive x axis corresponds to longitude 0. The latitudes / z-values are alternately increasing and decreasing (so over a period of two shells they follow the same cosine-type shape as the x-values do over the period of each circle).
%C A343630 The sequence can be seen as a table with row length of 3, where each row corresponds to the (x,y,z)-coordinates of one point (the three columns are then A343631, A343632 and A343633), or as a table with row lengths 3*A005875, where A005875(r) is the number of points at distance sqrt(r) from the origin.
%C A343630 Sequence A343640 gives a square spiral variant.
%e A343630 Shell r = 0 is the origin, {(0,0,0)}.
%e A343630 Shell r = 1 contains the 6 points {(0,0,1), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (-1,0,0), (0,-1,0), (0,0,-1)}, located on the North pole, equator and South pole of the unit sphere. The equator (as all circles in the sequel) is "scanned" by increasing longitude = polar coordinate phi in the (x,y) plane with given z, where (x,y,z) = (R,0,0) has longitude 0.
%e A343630 Shell r = R^2 = 2 contains the 12 points (now in order of increasing z-coordinate) {(1,0,-1), (0,1,-1), (-1,0,-1), (0,-1,-1); (1,1,0), (-1,1,0), (-1,-1,0), (1,-1,0); (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (-1,0,1), (0,-1,1)}.
%e A343630 Then again, the points of shell r = R^2 = 3 are ordered by decreasing z-coordinate.
%e A343630 There are no points in shell r = R^2 = 7 = A004215(1), so from there on up to the next empty shell, the shells with even r are filled by decreasing z-coordinate.

%o A343630 A343630_vec=concat([[Vec(P) | P<-A343630_row(n)] | n<-[0..6]]) \\ beyond the empty row 7 one must correct the second argument, e.g. by using {... P<-S=A343630_row(n,d)]+(#S&&!d*=-1) ...} to flip the sign of d, initialized to 1, at each nonempty shell.
