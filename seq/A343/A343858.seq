%N A343858 Square array T(m,n), read by ascending antidiagonals. Let f(k) = k/2 if k is even, otherwise ((2*n+1)*k+2*r+1)/2, r is the smallest integer greater than -1, where m = f^j(m) for j > 0 exists and is determined in A345228, T(m,n) is the smallest number reached in the cyclic trajectory of m = f^j(m). f^j(m) means j times recursion into f(m).
%C A343858 This sequence, together with A345228, provides information regarding generalized Collatz functions. (Replace 3*k+1 in the standard Collatz function with a more general a*k+b; then a = 1+2*n and b = 1+2*A345228(m,n).) A345228 tells us which m are part of a cyclic orbit but not if these are part of the same cycle. This sequence identifies each distinct cycle with a different number. Example: If A345228(m1,n) = A345228(m2,n) we know m1 and m2 are part of a cycle but not necessarily the same cycle. If T(m1,n) <> T(m2,n) we know m1 and m2 are not in the same cycle.
%C A343858 The value of n appears to have only a small effect in this sequence and in a majority of cases we find T(m,n) = A000265(m) holds true. This is surprising, given how n is involved in the definition.

%F A343858 T((1+2*n)*m,n)/T(m,n) = 1+2*n.
%F A343858 T((1+2*(n-b))*m,n)/T(m,n) = 1+2*(n-b). 0 <= b <= n. This formula is only for the majority of cases true if b > 0. For each column m are some rows n where an exception will be seen.
%F A343858 T(m,n) <= A000265(m) (largest odd divisor of m).
%F A343858 T(m,n) = A000265(m) For the majority of all n.

%e A343858 Example: T(3,4) = 3 -> f(n): k/2; (9*k+21)/2. This is because r = A345228(3,4) = 10 and 2*10+1 = 21.
%e A343858 f(3) = 24, f(24) = 12, f(12) = 6, f(6) = 3, f(3) = 24, ....
%e A343858 The smallest number in this cycle is 3.
