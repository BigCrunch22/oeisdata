%N A343714 Palindromic primes of the form p//q//reverse(p), where p is a prime (not necessarily palindromic) and q, of course, is a palindromic prime.
%C A343714 Note that reverse(p) need not be a prime; e.g., a(7)=19391 is the concatenation of 19, 3, and 91=7*13. If a requirement were added that reverse(p) also be a prime, the result would be sequence A343715.
%e A343714 353 is a term because it is a palindromic prime (A002385) and is the concatenation of 3 (a prime), 5 (a palindromic prime), and 3 (the reverse of 3).
%e A343714 31513 is a term in two ways: as the concatenation 3//151//3 and as the concatenation 31//5//13.
%e A343714 7392937 is a term in three ways: 7//39293//7, 73//929//37, and 739//2//937.
%Y A343714 Cf. A002385, A045336, A177678, A343715.
