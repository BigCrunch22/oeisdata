%N A343236 Decimal expansion of (A010476 - 3*A228496)/(4*Pi) - 1/8.
%C A343236 This constant gives the ratio of the area between three touching circles, one with half of the radius of the two others, and the area of one of the large circular disks.
%C A343236 See A343235 for the same problem with three identical circular disks, where also links on the Descartes-Steiner five circle theorem and the Soddy circles are given.
%C A343236 The isosceles triangle with the centers of the circles as corners has two angles alpha = arctan(sqrt(5)/2) = A228496 (about 48.2 degrees).
%C A343236 The ratio of the perimeter of the boundary of this circular cuspodial triangle and the perimeter of the large circle is alpha/(2*Pi) + 1/4 = 0.3838602364...
%C A343236 The radii of the inner and outer Soddy circles, normalized to the radius r of one of the two large circles are s_i = S_i/r = -3/2 + phi = A176055 - 2 = 0.1180339887... and s_o = S_o/r = 1/2 + phi = A176055 = 2 + s_i = 2.1180339887... Here phi = A001622 (golden ratio).
%F A343236 Equals A/(Pi*r^2) = (sqrt(5)/Pi - 3*arctan(sqrt(5)/2)/(2*Pi) - 1/4)/2, where A is the area between three mutually touching circular disks with radii r, r, and r/2 (in some length unit).
%F A343236 Equals sqrt(5)/(2*Pi) - 3*A228496/(4*Pi) - 1/8.
