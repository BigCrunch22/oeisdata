%N A343925 Irregular triangle read by rows: n-th row gives the numbers > 1 that can be multiplied by n the maximum number of times, see A343924, such that each product has distinct digits.
%C A343925 See A343924 for the maximum number of times the numbers in each row can multiply n to produce a series of products with distinct digits.
%C A343925 The number of terms in each row is extremely variable. For n below 1000 the numbers 556, 748, 813, 818, 848 can only be multiplied one time before a product with non-distinct digits is produced. For 556, for example, there are 7002 different numbers which satisfy this condition, the list starting with 5, 7, 15, 17, 19, ... . In comparison the next row for 557 has one term, 25, which can be multiplied by 557 the maximum of three times.
%C A343925 All rows correspond to numbers ending in two or more zeros, for example 100, have no terms as any product will also end in at least that many zeros.

%F A343925 row(n) has no terms for n > 4938271605 or for any number n ending in two or more 0's.
%e A343925 row(1) = 2 as 1 can be multiplied by 2 the maximum of 15 times producing products with distinct digits. The products are: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16348, 32768.
%e A343925 row(11) = 13, 14, 15, 18, 35, 72, 77 as these numbers can be multiplied by 11 the maximum of 3 times producing products with distinct digits. For example choosing 13 the products are 143, 1859, 24167.
