%N A343881 Table read by antidiagonals upward: T(n,k) is the least integer m > k such that k^x * m^y = c^n for some positive integers c, x, and y where x < n and y < n; n >= 2, k >= 1.
%C A343881 For prime p, the p-th row consists of distinct integers.
%C A343881 Conjecture: T(p,k) = A064549(k) for fixed k > 1 and sufficiently large p.
%F A343881 T(n,1) = 2^A020639(n).
