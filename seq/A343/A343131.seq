%N A343131 For m >= 1, the m-digit number k = d_m||...||d_2||d_1 is a term if it is divisible by f_m(k) that is the sum of the m elementary symmetric polynomials in m variables e_i(k): f_m(k) = Sum_{i=1..m} e_i(d_1, ..., d_m).
%C A343131 Equivalently, integers k that are divisible by A061486(k); the quotients obtained when these terms k are divided by A061486(k) are in A343132.
%C A343131 The idea of this sequence comes from A328864 (1st problem of the 30th British Mathematical Olympiad in 1994) and also from the elementary symmetric polynomials in m variables (see links) that allow the generalization of this Olympiad problem to m-digit numbers.
%C A343131 -> When k = u has only one digit, then f_1(k) = e_1(u) = u and the numbers u from 1 to 9 satisfy u/e_1(u) = 1, so those are the first nine terms of this sequence.
%C A343131 -> When k = du has two digits, the numbers that are divisible by f_2(k) = (e_1(d,u) + e_2(d,u)) = (d+u) + (d*u) are the first 19 terms of A038366, from a(10) = 10 to a(28) = 99.
%C A343131 -> when k = hdu is a 3-digit number, then e_1(h,d,u) = h+d+u, e_2(h,d,u) = h*d+d*u+u*h and e_3(h,d,u) = h*d*u so f_3(k) = (h+d+u) + (hd+du+uh) + (hdu). This subsequence with 3-digit numbers A328864 has 50 terms that are here from a(29) = 100 to a(78) = 999.
%C A343131 -> When k = thdu is a 4-digit number, then e_1(t,h,d,u) = e_1(k) = t+h+d+u, e_2(t,h,d,u)= t*h+t*d+t*u+h*d+h*u+d*u, e_3(t,h,d,u) = t*h*d+t*h*u+t*d*u+h*d*u and e_4(t,h,d,u) = t*h*d*u with f_4(k) = e_1(t,h,d,u) + e_2(t,h,d,u) + e_3(t,h,d,u) + e_4(t,h,d,u). Numbers k such that k/f(k) is an integer form another subsequence with 87 terms. This subsequence with 4-digit numbers goes from a(79) = 1000 to a(165) = 9999.

%e A343131 For k = 7, f_1(7) = 7, and 7/7 = 1, hence 7 is a term.
%e A343131 For k = 42, f_2(4,2) = 4+2 + 4*2 = 14 and 42/14 = 3, hence 42 is a term.
%e A343131 For k = 572, f_3(5,7,2) = 5+7+2 + 5*7+7*2+2*5 + 5*7*2 = 14 + 59 + 70 = 143 and 572/143 = 4, hence 572 is a term.
%e A343131 For k = 3225, f_4(3,2,2,5) = 3+2+2+5 + 3*2+3*2+3*5+2*2+2*5+2*5 + 3*2*2+3*2*5+3*2*5+2*2*5 + 3*2*2*5 = 215 and 3225/215 = 15, hence 3225 is a term.
