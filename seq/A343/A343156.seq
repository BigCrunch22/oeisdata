%N A343156 Starting at n, a(n) = number of iterations of the map x -> A084317(x) (concatenate distinct prime factors of x) required to reach a prime, or -1 if no prime is ever reached.
%C A343156 Judging by the behavior of similar sequences, it is likely that almost all values of a(n) are -1. n = 407 (see A343157) seems to be the first open case.

%e A343156 10 = 2*5 -> 25 = 5^2 -> 5, prime, taking two steps, so a(10)=2.
%e A343156 a(91) = 64: see A084319.
