%N A343889 Integer k of the pairs (k, m) ordered by m with 1 < k < m such that k has the same prime divisors as m, and, k+1 has the same prime divisors as m+1.
%C A343889 First column of the array A343101.
%C A343889 Even integer 2^q - 2, q >= 2 is a term (A000918), and only 75 is known to be not of this form.
