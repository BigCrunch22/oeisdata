%N A343550 Numbers k > 9 such that the number m formed by inserting a digit 0 between each pair of digits in k is divisible by k.
%C A343550 One-digit terms are not considered since no 0 digits can be inserted.
%C A343550 If k is a term then so is k*10^i, i > 0.
%C A343550 If k is a term then so is k*i, 2 <= i <= 9 as long as no carry occurs in the multiplication.
%C A343550 The number of terms with n digits is (12, 29, 51, 107, 149, 240, 308, 438, 566, 789, 1007), 2 <= n <= 12.
%e A343550 18 is a term because 108/18=6, and so is 1185 because 1010805/1185=853.
%e A343550 10101/111=91, 1010100/1110=910, 101010000/11100=9100, ... so 111, 1110, 11100, ... are all terms.
%e A343550 1000401/1041=961 and 2000802/2082=961 so 1041 and 2082 are terms but 3123 is not since it does not divide 3010203.
%Y A343550 Cf. A051022, A285176, A343551, A343552.
