%N A343540 Squares visited by a trapped knight on a square-spiral numbered board where the knight is shifted one square up and one square to the right after each move.
%C A343540 The squares are numbered starting with 1 at the origin (0,0). The sequence is finite: when arriving on square number a(180) = 157, there is no free square within reach for the next move.
%C A343540 Shifting the knight only 1 square to the right leads to an infinite sequence. Similarly, shifting only 1 square up leads to an infinite sequence. More generally, if the knight jumps (1,n) spaces and is shifted m squares to the right, m > n leads to an infinite sequence.
