%N A343464 The number of n-vertex graphs that are minimally non-Hamming-embeddable.
%C A343464 For Hamming embeddability see A343463. Graph G is minimally non-Hamming-embeddable if G cannot be embedded, yet G\v is embeddable for all vertices v.
%C A343464 I conjecture (on admittedly weak evidence) that these graphs are always planar.

%e A343464 For n=5 the a(5)=2 graphs are C5 and K32.
