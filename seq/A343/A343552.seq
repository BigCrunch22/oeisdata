%N A343552 Numbers m such that for some number k dividing n, m is formed by inserting a digit 0 between each pair of digits of k.
%C A343552 If m is a term then so is m*10^(2i), i > 0.
%C A343552 If m is a term then so is m*i, 2 <= i <= 9 as long as no carry occurs in the multiplication.
%e A343552 108 is a term because 108/18=6, and so is 1010805 because 1010805/1185=853.
