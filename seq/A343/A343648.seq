%N A343648 Triangle read by rows, 1 <= k <= n: T(n,k) is the number of (unlabeled) connected graphs with n nodes and zero forcing number k.
%C A343648 The zero forcing number of a graph can be defined as follows. Start with a blue/white coloring of the nodes. At each step, all white nodes, which are currently the unique white neighbor of a blue node, are colored blue. The zero forcing number is the minimum number of blue nodes in an initial coloring that leads to all nodes being blue after a finite number of steps.

%F A343648 T(n,1) = 1. (The path graph is the only n-node graph with zero forcing number 1.)
%F A343648 T(n,n-1) = 1 for n >= 2. (The complete graph is the only connected n-node graph with zero forcing number n-1.)
%F A343648 T(n,n) = 0 for n >= 2.
