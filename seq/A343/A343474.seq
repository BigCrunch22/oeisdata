%N A343474 a(n) is the number of preference profiles for n men and n women, where all men prefer the same woman and all women prefer the same man.
%C A343474 Every preference profile of this type has exactly one pair of people who rank each other first.
%C A343474 This is the same number of preference profiles as when all men rank the same woman at only the i-th place, and all women rank the same man at only the j-th place, where i and j can be anywhere from 1 to n.
%C A343474 The total number of possible profiles is A185141.

%F A343474 a(n) = n^2 * (n-1)!^(2*n).
%F A343474 a(n) = A342573(n)^2, where A342573 ignores women's preferences.
%e A343474 When n=2, there are 4 ways to pick a man and woman who are preferred by all people of the opposite gender, and then 1 way to fill in each of the remaining slots in every person's preference profile.  So, there are 4 different preference profiles.
