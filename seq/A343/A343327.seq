%N A343327 Start with a(1)=1; thereafter a(n+1) = Sum_{k=1..n such that d(a(k)) = d(a(n))} d(a(k)) where d = A000005.
%C A343327 Every nonzero number occurs in the sequence since all terms in A000005 are included. The multiplicity of any term m (> 2) is d(m)-1 (since m > 2 cannot be created by adding m 1s). Prime 2 occurs twice, consecutively (see example), and thereafter no two adjacent terms can be prime because the term prior to a prime q is the first occurrence of 2^(q-1) (composite for q > 2), and since d(q)=2, the following term is a multiple (> 1) of 2. Thus each prime > 2 is flanked by composite even numbers, and occurs once only. Conjecture: The primes, after the first appearance of 2, appear in their natural order.
%C A343327 The primes appear in order at a(n) for n in {3, 4, 6, 14, 42, 507, 1939, 22454, 90322, ...}, with a(3) = a(4) = 2. No further primes appear for n <= 2^20. - _Michael De Vlieger_, May 01 2021

%e A343327 Given a(1)=1, a(2) is also 1, since a(1) has no prior term. a(3)=1+1=2 and a(4)=2 because a(3) has 2 divisors and there is no prior term with 2 divisors. a(5)=2+2=4.
