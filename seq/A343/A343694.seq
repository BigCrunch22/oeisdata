%N A343694 a(n) is the number of men's preference profiles in the stable marriage problem with n men and n women, such that all men prefer different women as their first choices.
%C A343694 For such a preference profile, the men-proposing Gale-Shapley algorithm ends in one round since each woman receives exactly one proposal in the first round.
%C A343694 This sequence also counts the preference profiles for n men who rank n women such that all men prefer different women as their i-th choice, for an i between 1 and n, inclusive.

%F A343694 a(n) = n! * (n-1)!^n.
%e A343694 For n=2, there are two ways to pick men's first preferences, and then one way to complete the preference profile, making a total of 2 preference profiles.
