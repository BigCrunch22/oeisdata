%N A343102 a(n) is the sum of the number of times the digits in n (without repetition) have appeared in the sequence.
%C A343102 The fixed points > 0 in the first one million terms are 10, 310, 341, 351, 514. It is likely no more exist.
%H A343102 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A343102/a343102.png">Image of the terms for n=0..1000000</a>. The green line is a(n) = n.
%e A343102 a(0) to a(9) = 0 as the digits 0 to 9 have not appeared in the sequence.
%e A343102 a(10) = 10 as 1 has not appeared while 0 has appeared ten times, thus a(10) = 0 + 10 = 10.
%e A343102 a(11) = 1 as the repetitions of 1 in 11 are ignored, and 1 has appeared once in the sequence.
%e A343102 a(12) = 2 as 1 has appeared twice while 2 has not appeared, thus a(12) = 2 + 0 = 2.
%e A343102 a(20) = 19 as 2 has appeared eight times while 0 has appeared eleven times, thus a(20) = 8 + 11 = 19.
%e A343102 a(22) = 8 as the repetitions of 2 in 22 are ignored, and 2 has appeared eight times in the sequence.
