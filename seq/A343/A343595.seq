%N A343595 a(n) is the number of axially symmetric tilings of the order-n Aztec Diamond by square tetrominoes and Z-shaped tetrominoes, not counting rotations and reflections as distinct.
%C A343595 No tiling is symmetric to both the x- and the y-axis.
%C A343595 No tiling is symmetric to an oblique symmetry axis of the diamond.
%C A343595 If a tiling is symmetric to the x-axis then a reflection over the y-axis is equal to a rotation by 180 degrees.
%C A343595 The number of tilings is 4 * a(n) if rotations are counted as distinct.
%C A343595 All tilings have exactly the minimum number of square tetrominoes given by ceiling(n/2).
