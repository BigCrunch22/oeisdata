%N A343980 Decimal expansion of the expected length of the first cycle in an evolving graph with n vertices rescaled by n^(-1/6).
%C A343980 The first cycle in an evolving graph with n vertices has size K n^(1/6) + O(n^(3/22)) on the average with K given by a double integral (see the formula below).
%C A343980 In "The first cycles in an evolving graph" by Philippe Flajolet, Boris Pittel and Donald E. Knuth, the constant K is estimated as 2.0337 using a tedious computation at the end of the paper: one part of the integral is estimated numerically, and the complement is represented as divergent series for which an optimal truncation rule is used. Their techniques can be used to obtain more digits of this constant using interval arithmetic.
