%N A343013 Lexicographically earliest strictly increasing sequence of numbers whose partial products have mutually distinct exponents in their prime factorization (A130091).
%C A343013 The numbers of terms not exceeding 10^k, for k=1,2,..., are 6, 46, 293, 1939, 13534, 97379, .... Apparently, this sequence has an asymptotic density 0.
%C A343013 Are there infinitely many terms of each prime signature? In particular, the prime terms seem to be sparse: 2, 5, 17, 79, 491, 2011, 8191 and no other below 10^6. Are there infinitely many prime terms in this sequence?
