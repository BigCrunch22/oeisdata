%N A343297 Numbers k such that there are exactly two multisets of cardinality k where the sum equals the product (A033178(k)=2).
%C A343297 At most one of a(n) - 1 and 2*a(n)-1 are composite. More precisely, a(n) are those positive integers such that exactly one of product(s)*(a(n)+sum(s)-k-2)+1 can be factored as (product(s)*p-1)*(product(s)*q-1), where s varies over all multisets of k positive integers and 1 < p <= q < a(n). The first statement is given by considering s = {} and s = {2}. a(50) is greater than 10^4.
