%N A343729 a(n) is the smallest number that starts a run of exactly n consecutive integers that are neither primes nor semiprimes.
%e A343729 a(5) = 242 because 241 is a prime, 247=13*19 is a semiprime, none of the 5 consecutive integers between them are primes or semiprimes (242 = 2*11^2, 243 = 3^5, 244 = 2^2*61, 245 = 5*7^2, and 246 = 2*3*41), and there is no smaller run of exactly 5 consecutive integers that are neither prime nor semiprime.
