%N A092434 Number of words X=x(1)x(2)x(3)...x(n) of length n in three digits {0,1,2} that are invariant under the mapping X -> Y, where y(i)=((AD)^(i-1))x(1) and where (AD) denotes the absolute difference (AD)x(i)=abs(x(i+1)-x(i)) (in other words, y(i) is the i-th element in the diagonal of leading entries in the table of absolute differences of {x(1), x(2),...,x(n)}).
%C A092434 In the two digits {0,1} the corresponding sequence is 2,2,4,4,8,8,16,16,32,32,64,64,... which appears to be A060546.
%F A092434 It is conjectured that a(n)=(n+2)*2^((n-1) div 2).
%e A092434 The table of absolute differences of {2,1,1,0} is
%e A092434 2
%e A092434 1.1
%e A092434 1.0.1
%e A092434 0.1.1.0
%e A092434 with the diagonal of leading absolute differences again forming the word (2110).
%e A092434 Thus (2110) is one of the twelve words in the digits {0,1,2} that are counted in calculating a(4).
%Y A092434 Cf. A060546.
