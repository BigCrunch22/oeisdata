%N A092944 Group the natural numbers so that the n-th group contains n numbers whose sum as well as the group product + 1 is prime. Sequence contains the first member of the groups.
%C A092944 The n-th group is chosen so that it is lexicographically earliest.
%C A092944 First n-2 numbers are the least previously unused numbers.
%C A092944 The (n-1)st number is chosen with the additional condition that if the product is odd, the sum is also odd (to avoid an impossible situation in picking the n-th number).
%C A092944 The n-th number is chosen as the least unused number that meets the two prime conditions.
%C A092944 In the 3rd group, 6 is selected as the 2nd number rather than 5, else no 3rd number could be found to meet the prime conditions.
