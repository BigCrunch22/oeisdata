%N A092749 a(n) is the least k such that m^2 + m + k is prime for m = 0..n.

%C A092749 The numbers 2, 3, 5, 11, 17, and 41 above are the only numbers B such that m^2+m+B is prime for m=0,...,B-2; this can be proved (see Mollin's paper) and is closely related to the celebrated Rabinowitsch criterion.
%C A092749 Since the value of m^2+m+B is B^2 for m=B-1, one cannot possibly do better than this.
%C A092749 An obvious question of course is whether for given n, a(n) exists at all. This is far from obvious. Assuming the generally believed k-tuplets conjecture, the answer is yes as was shown by Andrew Granville. For a proof (which is not very difficult) see the paper by Mollin.
%C A092749 It is also known, due to work of Lukes, Patterson and Williams, that any further elements in the above sequence, if they exist, exceed 10^18.
