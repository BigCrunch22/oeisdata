%N A092996 Least k such that 1 < p < n < c < k, where p is a prime and c is a composite number such that for every p there exists a distinct c.
%C A092996 a(n) is obtained by moving forward beginning with n+1 and counting prime(n) composite numbers, finally adding 1 to the last composite number arising.
%e A092996 a(6) = 11 as there are three primes 2,3,5, < 6 and there are three composite numbers 8,9,10 between 6 and 11.
