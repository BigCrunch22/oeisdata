%N A092450 Triangle read by rows: T(m,n) = number of weak factorization systems (trivial Quillen model structures) on the product category [m]x[n], where [m] denotes the total order on m objects, viewed as a category.
%C A092450 Specifying a weak factorization system on a poset category is equivalent to specifying a set of morphisms that includes all identity morphisms and is closed under composition and pullback.

%F A092450 T(0, n) = T(n, 0) = 1. T(1, n) = T(n, 1) = C(n) the n-th Catalan number (A000108).
%e A092450 T(2, 2) = 10:  the category has five nonidentity morphisms with relations ca = db = e.  a is a pullback of d and of e;  b is a pullback of c and of e.  So there are ten allowable sets of morphisms:  omitting identities for brevity, they are {}, {a}, {b}, {a,b}, {b,c}, {a,d}, {a,b,e}, {a,b,c,e}, {a,b,d,e}, {a,b,c,d,e}.
