%N A092367 Numbers n with property that the binary cyclic right-rotating progressive sum of digits (see A091821) is exactly n/2.
%C A092367 There are large gaps in this sequence. For any n>=2 the number 2^2n - 2^n + 1 and the following 2^2n + 2^(n+1) - 3 natural numbers will definitely not occur in this sequence.
