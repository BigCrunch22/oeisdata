%N A092243 Score at stage n in "tug of war" between prime gap increases vs. prime gap decreases: start with score = 0 at n = 1 and at stage n = k > 1, increase (resp. decrease) the score by 1 if the k-th prime gap is greater (resp. less) than the previous prime gap.
%C A092243 a(n) is nonnegative for n = 1,...,41252. At n = 41253, a(n) = -1. At most larger values of n, up to n = 250000 (as far as I've checked), a(n) is overwhelmingly negative.
%C A092243 Questions. Is s > 0 for some n > 250000? Is s bounded from below? Is s bounded from above? Is s > 0 for infinitely many values of n? Is s < 0 for infinitely many values of n?

%F A092243 Cumulative sums of A079054 (negated).
%e A092243 At stage n = 1, the score a(1) = 0. The first prime gap is 3-2 = 1.
%e A092243 At stage n = 2, the second prime gap is 5-3 = 2 > 1, the previous prime gap. Hence a(2) = a(1) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1.
%e A092243 At stage n = 3, the third prime gap is 7-5 = 2, which equals the previous prime gap. The score doesn't change; hence a(3) = 1.
%e A092243 At stage n = 4, the fourth prime gap is 11-7 = 4 > 2, the third prime gap. Hence a(4) = a(3) + 1 = 1+1 = 2.
