%N A092329 Number of nonisomorphic, constructed lattice-square designs of order n as n runs through the odd prime-powers (3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, ...).
%C A092329 Equivalence classes of designs are challenging. Here the difficulty is reduced by focusing on constructed designs.

%E A092329 What does "constructed" mean? If, as I suspect, it means constructed as of Mar 17 2004, then this is a time-dependent sequence and does not belong in the OEIS. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 18 2004
