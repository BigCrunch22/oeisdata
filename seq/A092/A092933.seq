%N A092933 Let 1, a, b, c,... be the numbers coprime to k in ascending order; then k belongs to this sequence if k = a partial sum of these numbers.
%C A092933 Sequence is infinite; it includes all powers of 4. More generally, if n is in this sequence, let i be the number just added to make the sum equal to n. If i+1 is divisible by every prime divisor of n, then n*m^2 is in the sequence for any number m whose prime divisors all divide n. This gives us subsequences 3*9^i, 6*4^i*9^j, 20*4^i*25^j, 120*4^i*9^j*25^k, etc. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Dec 18 2006
