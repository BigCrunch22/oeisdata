%N A047947 a(n) is the number of k values for which A023193(k) = n.
%C A047947 The old name was: "Schinzel's rhobar(n), number of distinct lengths of a block of consecutive integers on which a maximum of n primes occurs infinitely often (under the k-tuple conjecture)." [Note that "rhobar" is A023193.]
%D A047947 Computed by _Achim Flammenkamp_.
%e A047947 A block of 21 through 26 consecutive integers may contain at most 7 primes infinitely often. There are 6 possible lengths (21 through 26), so rhobar(7) = 6.
