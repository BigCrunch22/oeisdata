%N A187042 Numbers the expansion of which over distinct terms of A050376 contains the same number of primes and perfect squares.
%C A187042 The sequence does not contain squarefree numbers or perfect squares.
%C A187042 Initially the sequence matches A378494 (the intersection of A000379 and A026424). The first differences are the absence here of 120 and 168 and the inclusion here of 216. - _Peter Munn_, Jul 13 2024 (edited by _Paolo Xausa_, Nov 29 2024).
