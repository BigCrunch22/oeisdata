%N A187451 Multiset choose 5: number of ways to choose five elements from the multiset representative corresponding to the k-th multiset repetition class defining partition of n in canonical Abramowitz-Stegun order.
%C A187451 The array a(n,k), called "Multiset choose 5", is also denoted by MS(5;n,k). It is the fifth member of an l-family of arrays for multiset choose l, called MS(l;n,k).
%C A187451 The row length of this array is A007294=[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 4, 6, 7, 7,...].
%C A187451 MS(5;n,k) gives for every multiset of the multiset repetition class encoded by the k-th multiset defining partition of n the number of ways to choose five elements from it. The Abramowitz-Stegun (A-St) order for partitions is used (see A036036).
%C A187451 For the characteristic array of multiset repetition class defining partitions of n in A-St order see A176723. See also the W. Lang link there and in A187447.
%C A187451 Note that multiset choose l should not be confused with N multichoose l (see, e.g., Wolfram's Mathworld). Here one picks from a multiset l=4 of its elements.
%C A187451 Ordinary sets appear exactly for n=T(N), with the triangular numbers T(N):=A000217(N). They are defined by the partition (1,2,...,N) for N>=1, and the empty partition for n=N=0.  a(T(N),1)= binomial(N,5).
%C A187451 This investigation was stimulated by the Griffiths and Mez≈ë paper cited under A176725.
%F A187451 a(n,k) gives the number of ways to choose five elements from the multiset representative defined by the k-th multiset repetition class defining partition of n, with k=1,...,A007294(n).
%F A187451 a(n,k) = binomial(M(n,k)+4,5) -
%F A187451 sum(m(n,k)[4-p]*binomial(M(n,k)+p-1,p),p=0..3) +

%F A187451   where M(n,k) = MS(1;n,k) := A176725(n,k), and m(n,k)[j] the j-th member of the multiplicity list m(n,k) of the exponents of the k-th multiset repetition class defining partition of n.

%e A187451 a(7,2)=MS(5;7,2)=1 because the second multiset repetition class defining partition of n=7 is [1^3,2^2] (from the characteristic array A176723) encoding the 5-multiset representative {1,1,1,2,2}, and there is 1 possibility to choose 5 elements from this set, namely 1,1,1,2,2.
%e A187451 a(T(4),1)=a(10,1)=MS(5;10,1) = 0 from the ordinary set {1,2,3,4} (defined by the multiset repetition class defining partition 1,2,3,4). This coincides with binomial(4,5)=0.
%e A187451 a(7,3)=MS(5;7,3)=2 from {1,1,1,1,1,2} choose 5 which is 2, namely 1,1,1,1,1 and 1,1,1,1,2. The corresponding multiset repetition class defining partition has exponent list [5,1] and this is the 16th in the A-St ordered list of such partitions (starting with the empty partition).
%e A187451 a(8,3) = 2 = binomial(2+4,5) - (0+0+0+binomial(2+2,3)) + 0 + 0 + 0 = 6-4, because the relevant partition has exponents [6,1] (corresponding to the 7-multiset representative {1,1,1,1,1,1,2}) with MS(1;8,3) = 2, and the multiplicity list of the exponents is m(8,3)=[1,0,0,0,0,1]. Hence m(8,3)[4], m(8,3[3] and m(8,2)[2] vanish, and m(8,2)[1]=1. The two choices are 1,1,1,1 and 1,1,1,2.
%e A187451 a(10,3)= 4 = binomial(3+4,5) - (0+0+0+binomial(3+2,3)*2) + 0 + 3 + 0 = 21-10*2 +3, corresponding to the 7-multiset representative {1,1,1,1,1,2,3} with MS(1;10,3)= 3, exponents [5,1,1] with multiplicity list m(10,3)=[2,0,0,0,1]. Hence m(10,3)[4], m(10,3)[3] and m(10,3)[2] vanish, and m(10,3)[1]=2. The four choices are 1,1,1,1,1; 1,1,1,1,2; 1,1,1,1,3 and 1,1,1,2,3.
