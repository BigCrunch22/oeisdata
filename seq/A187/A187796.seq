%N A187796 Primes whose digits are a permutation of (0, ..., m) for some m.
%C A187796 Starts with the 5-digit terms listed in A109176: There is no smaller prime of that form, since there is no odd number of that form with less than 3 digits, and those with digits {0,1,2} and {0,1,2,3} (as, e.g., 2013...) are all divisible by 3, thus composite.
%C A187796 For similar reasons, there cannot be terms with the 6 digits {0, ..., 5} or the 7 digits {0, ..., 6} (since 1 + ... + 5 (+ 6) is divisible by 3).
%C A187796 The 8-digit terms a(17)..a(2684) are also listed in A109177 and A109178 (in reverse order). Again, there are no 9- or 10-digit terms (since 0+1+...+8(+9) is divisible by 9). Therefore, the sequence has no terms beyond the 2684 terms < 76543210 listed in the b-file.

%F A187796 This sequence A187796 = A109176 union A109177.
%e A187796 As explained in the comments, there cannot be a term with fewer than 5 digits. The smallest number whose digits are a permutation of (0, ..., 4) is 10234, but this is even and cannot be a prime. The next larger one happens to be prime, so that's a(1) = 10243.
%e A187796 It is also explained in the comments why there's no term larger than 76543210. The largest odd numbers of the given form below this limit are of the form 7654xyz1 and 7654abc3, with xyz resp. abc permutations of 023 resp. 012. It happens that the case xyz=023 is the only one which yields a prime: this is the largest term of this sequence, a(2684) = 76540231 = A109178(1).
