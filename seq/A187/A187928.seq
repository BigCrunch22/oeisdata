%N A187928 Number of embeddings on the sphere of planar graphs with n edges having connectivity exactly 2 and minimum vertex degree at least 3.
%C A187928 The graphs are 2-connected, but not 3-connected. The graphs were enumerated using plantri (by B.D. McKay & G. Brinkmann) for the purpose of finding compound perfect squared squares. If all graphs with n edges are generated then all compound squares in order n-1 can be obtained from them. Graphs with minimum degree at least 3 are also called homeomorphically irreducible.
