%N A187779 Numbers n for which the terms of A014320 up to n=A014320(k) are a permutation of {1,2,4,6,...,2*(k-1)}.
%C A187779 An old conjecture states that the equation prime(n+1)-prime(n)=2m is solvable for m=1/2,1,2,...  . a(n) indicate the smallest term of A014320 such that among the previous terms there occur 1 and all previous even numbers<=a(n). The primes up to 10^8 do not generate any further terms.
%C A187779 According to Thomas R. Nicely (see Links) the next term, if it exists, must be greater than 1344 and equal to a gap occurring between primes greater than 4*10^18. - _Giovanni Resta_, Jan 06 2013
