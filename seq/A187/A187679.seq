%N A187679 "Connect the dots": Minimal number of circular arcs needed to connect all points of an n X n grid of points.
%C A187679 a(7)=9 is only a conjecture at present. I include it in the Data line to disambiguate this sequence from its neighbors.
%C A187679 For straight line segments the answer is conjectured to be 2n-2 for all n >=3, with a(1)=1, a(2)=3.
