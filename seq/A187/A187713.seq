%N A187713 Base-5 Keith numbers.
%C A187713 Among bases b = 2 to 36, in b = 5 there is the third highest percentage of Keith numbers between b and b^3 (that is, numbers with two or three digits); only binary and ternary have more Keith numbers in that range.
%e A187713 a(2) = 9. In base 5, the number 9 is written 14, and the second order linear recurrence is then 1, 4, 5, 9, ... therefore 9 is a Keith number in base 5.
%e A187713 The number 14 is a Keith number in base 10 but not base 5, as we have: 2, 4, 6, 10, 16, ...
