%N A187752 Number of times the binary representation of n occurs in the concatenation of the binary representation of all smaller numbers.
%C A187752 Related to "early bird" (decimal: A116700, binary: A161373) and Hannah Rollman's numbers (cf. A048991, A048992 for decimal; A118248 and A118247-A118251 for binary versions). The latter would correspond to a variant of this sequence which has indices of nonzero terms omitted from the concatenation.
%e A187752 a(3) = 1 since concatenation of 0,1,2 in binary yields "0110", and 3 = "11"[2] occurs once in this string.
