%N A374610 Smallest result of n in "base-p" using digits 0,1,2 and interpreted as base-3.
%C A374610 A "base-p" representation of n is n = Sum_{i} d_i * prime(i+1) with i >= 0 and with "digits" 0 <= d_i <= 2.
%C A374610 Among possible representations, a(n) is the smallest a(n) = Sum_{i} d_i * 3^i.
%C A374610 The effect is to the lazy representation of n as the sum of up to 2 of each prime, with lazy meaning work from largest to smallest prime and use the fewest of each as long as smaller primes will be sufficient to complete the sum.
%e A374610 For n = 3, 3 = 1*3 + 0*2 = 10_p => 10_3 = 1*3 + 0*1 = 3_10 = a(3).
%e A374610 For n = 5, 5 = 1*3 + 1*2 = 11_p => 11_3 = 1*3 + 1*1 = 4_10 = a(5).
%e A374610 For n = 19, 19 = 1*7 + 1*5 + 1*3 + 2*2 = 1112_p => 1112_3 = 1*27 + 1*9 + 1*3 + 2*1 = 41_10 = a(19).
