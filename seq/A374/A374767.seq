%N A374767 Numbers k such that the leaders of strictly decreasing runs in the k-th composition in standard order are distinct.
%C A374767 The leaders of strictly decreasing runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal strictly decreasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.
%C A374767 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.

%e A374767 The 10000000th composition in standard order is (3,1,4,3,2,1,2,8), with strictly decreasing runs ((3,1),(4,3,2,1),(2),(8)), with leaders (3,4,2,1) so 10000000 is in the sequence.
