%N A374741 Sum of leaders of weakly decreasing runs in the n-th composition in standard order.
%C A374741 The leaders of weakly decreasing runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal weakly decreasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.
%C A374741 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.

%e A374741 The maximal weakly decreasing subsequences of the 1234567th composition in standard order are ((3,2,1),(2,2,1),(2),(5,1,1,1)), so a(1234567) is 3+2+2+5 = 12.
