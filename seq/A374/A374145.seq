%N A374145 Number of length-n binary words whose subword complexity is bounded by 2i for  1<=i<=n, and containing no blocks of exponent > 5/2.
%C A374145 The exponent of a word is defined to be its length divided by its shortest period.  For example, "alfalfa" has exponent 7/3.   Subword complexity is the number of distinct length-n blocks.
