%N A374629 Irregular triangle listing the leaders of maximal weakly increasing runs in the n-th composition in standard order.
%C A374629 The leaders of maximal weakly increasing runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal weakly increasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.
%C A374629 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.

%e A374629 The 58654th composition in standard order is (1,1,3,2,4,1,1,1,2), with maximal weakly increasing runs ((1,1,3),(2,4),(1,1,1,2)), so row 58654 is (1,2,1).
