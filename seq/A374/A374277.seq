%F A374277 Intersection of this sequence and 5-smooth numbers (A051037) is A306044 \ {1}.
%e A374277 8 is in this sequence since it is even and a multiple of neither 3 nor 5.
%e A374277 10 is not in this sequence since 10 = 2*5; both 2 and 5 divide 30.
%e A374277 14 is in this sequence since it is even and a multiple of neither 3 nor 5, etc.
