%N A374284 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; a(n) = least k != a(m), m < n, such that omega(a(n-1)) >= omega(k) requires rad(k) | a(n-1), where omega = A001221 and rad = A007947.
%C A374284 A greedy algorithm selects the smallest candidate k new to the sequence if either omega(k) > omega(a(n-1)) or if omega(k) <= omega(a(n-1)) and rad(k) | a(n-1).
%C A374284 Primes enter the sequence late.
%C A374284 For a(n) = p odd and prime and n <= 587, a(n-1) = 2*p. It seems for n > 1278, primes are not preceded by 2*p.
%C A374284 a(718) = 167 is followed by a(719) = 2*167. There are 13 primes that are followed by 2*p, with a(1364) = 293 apparently the largest. Normally, aside from p = 2 or 3, a(n) = p is such that a(n) and a(n+1) are coprime.
%C A374284 Prime powers a(n) = p^j follow a(n-1) = m*p, m >= 1. a(2, 3) = {2, 4}, a(5, 6) = {3, 9}, and these are the only primes immediately followed by their squares, since there are smaller candidates for a(n+1) for larger primes p. Only rarely is a(n+1) a multiple of p.
%C A374284 Let r be squarefree and let S_r = { k : rad(k) = r } = { m*r : rad(m) | r }. As consequence of the greedy algorithm and definition, k in S_r enter in order of magnitude. There are chains of consecutive terms in A033845 (e.g., a(31..33) = {36, 48, 54}) and A143207 (e.g., a(496..499) = {720, 750, 810, 900}).
%C A374284 Squarefree numbers k appear in trajectories according to omega(k).
%C A374284 Composite prime powers p^j, j > 1, appear relatively early, since rad(p^j) = p, and thus prime powers are minimally restricted after a(n-1) such that p | a(n-1).
%C A374284 Conjecture: this sequence is a permutation of natural numbers.

%e A374284 a(3) = 4 since omega(2) = omega(3) = 1, but rad(3) does not divide 2, but omega(4) = omega(2) = 1 and rad(4) = 2.
