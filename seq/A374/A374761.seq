%N A374761 Number of integer compositions of n whose leaders of strictly decreasing runs are distinct.
%C A374761 The leaders of strictly decreasing runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal strictly decreasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.

%e A374761 The composition (3,1,4,3,2,1,2,8) has strictly decreasing runs ((3,1),(4,3,2,1),(2),(8)), with leaders (3,4,2,1), so is counted under a(24).
