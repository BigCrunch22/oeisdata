%N A374351 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive integers such that for any triple i,j,k of consecutive terms, gcd(i,k) = 1 and A007947(i*j*k) is a term in A002110.
%C A374351 In other words a(n) is least k such that (k, a(n-2)) = 1 and rad(a(n-2)*a(n-1)*k) is a primorial number (alternatively i*j*k is in A055932).
%C A374351 Conjectures: A permutation of the positive integers, a(n) = prime p (> 2) iff p is least unused odd term, 2|i, and rad(i*j) is a primorial number divisible by all primes < p but not by p; primes appear in natural order.
%e A374351 a(1,2,3) = 1,2,3 the lexicographically earliest triple of numbers satisfying the definition: 3 and 1 are coprime whilst 1*2*3 = 6 = A002110(2).
%e A374351 a(4) = 5 because (2,5) = 1 and 2*3*5 = 30 = A002110(3).
%e A374351 a(9,10,11) = 8,12,15 and 7 is the smallest novel number prime to 12 and rad(12*15*7) = 210 = A002110(4).
