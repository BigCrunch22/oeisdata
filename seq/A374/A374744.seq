%N A374744 Numbers k such that the leaders of weakly decreasing runs in the k-th composition in standard order (A066099) are identical.
%C A374744 The leaders of weakly decreasing runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting into maximal weakly decreasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.
%C A374744 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
