%N A374336 a(n) is the numerator of x(n) = (2*x(n-1) + c(n)) mod 1, where c(n) = 1/n if n is a power of 3 and 0 otherwise, with x(0) = 0.
%C A374336 A constant alpha, defined as alpha = Sum_{n >= 1} p(n)/(q(n)*b^n), is b-normal if and only if the associated sequence, defined by x(0) = 0 and x(n) = (b*x(n-1) + p(n)/q(n)) mod 1, is equidistributed in the unit interval.
%C A374336 The present sequence gives the numerators of the associated sequence (where b = 2) for alpha_0 = Sum_{n >= 1} 1/((3^n)*2^(3^n)) = A192014. See Bailey and Borwein (2005), pp. 505-506 (third example of Theorem 3). They show that alpha_0, as well as any constant defined as Sum_{n >= 1} 1/((3^n)*2^(3^n+r_n)) (where r_n is the n-th binary digit of the real number r in the [0,1) interval), is 2-normal and transcendental.
%C A374336 Bailey and Borwein also note that terms follow a pattern of triply repeating segments, each of length 2*3^m and containing all integers relative prime to and less than 3^(m+1).
%C A374336 Denominators are given by A365458.
