%N A374639 Numbers k such that the leaders of maximal anti-runs in the k-th composition in standard order (A066099) are not distinct.
%C A374639 The leaders of maximal anti-runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal consecutive anti-runs (sequences with no adjacent equal terms) and taking the first term of each.
%C A374639 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
