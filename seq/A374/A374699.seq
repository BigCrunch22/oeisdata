%N A374699 Number of integer compositions of n whose leaders of maximal anti-runs are not weakly decreasing.
%C A374699 The leaders of maximal anti-runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal consecutive anti-runs (sequences with no adjacent equal terms) and taking the first term of each.
