%N A374339 Start with two vertices and draw a circle around each whose radius is the distance between the vertices. The sequence gives the number of curved edges constructed after n iterations of drawing circles with this same radius around every new vertex created from all circles' intersections.
%C A374339 See A374338 for further details and images.
%F A374339 a(n) = A374337(n) + A374338(n) - 1, by Euler's formula.
