%N A374684 Sum of leaders of strictly increasing runs in the n-th composition in standard order.
%C A374684 The leaders of strictly increasing runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal strictly increasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.

%e A374684 The maximal strictly increasing subsequences of the 1234567th composition in standard order are ((3),(2),(1,2),(2),(1,2,5),(1),(1),(1)) with leaders (3,2,1,2,1,1,1,1), so a(1234567) = 12.
