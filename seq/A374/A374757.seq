%N A374757 Irregular triangle read by rows where row n lists the leaders of strictly decreasing runs in the n-th composition in standard order.
%C A374757 The leaders of strictly decreasing runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal strictly decreasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.
%C A374757 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.

%e A374757 the 1234567th composition in standard order is (3,2,1,2,2,1,2,5,1,1,1), with strictly decreasing runs ((3,2,1),(2),(2,1),(2),(5,1),(1),(1)), so row 1234567 is (3,2,2,2,5,1,1).
