%N A374633 Numbers k such that the leaders of weakly increasing runs in the k-th composition in standard order (A066099) are identical.
%C A374633 The leaders of weakly increasing runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal weakly increasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.
%C A374633 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.

%e A374633 The maximal weakly increasing subsequences of the 26165th composition in standard order are ((1,3),(1,4),(1,2,2),(1)), with leaders (1,1,1,1), so 26165 is in the sequence.
