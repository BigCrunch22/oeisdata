%N A374920 Values k such that the two-player impartial {0,1}-Toggle game on a path P(k+6) = v(1)v(2)...v(k+6) with a (1^k,0,1,0,1,0,1)-weight assignment is a second-player winning game.
%C A374920 The two-player impartial {0,1}-Toggle game is played on a simple connected graph G where each vertex is assigned an initial weight of 0 or 1.
%C A374920 A Toggle move consists of selecting a vertex v and switching its weight as well as the weight of each of its neighbors. This move is only legal provided the weight of vertex v is 1 and the total sum of the vertex weights decreases.
%C A374920 In the special case G=P(k+6), a (1^k,0,1,0,1,0,1)-weight assignment is one in which vertices v(k+1), v(k+3), and v(k+5) are assigned weight 0 and all remaining vertices are assigned weight 1.
%C A374920 The path P(k+4m+2) where vertices v(k+1), v(k+3), ..., v(k+4m+1) are assigned weight 0 and all remaining vertices are assigned weight 1 will have the same Grundy numbers as G.
