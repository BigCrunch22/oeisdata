%N A374743 Number of integer compositions of n whose leaders of weakly decreasing runs are distinct.
%C A374743 The weakly decreasing run-leaders of a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal weakly decreasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.

%e A374743 The composition (1,3,1,4,1,2,2,1) has maximal weakly decreasing subsequences ((1),(3,1),(4,1),(2,2,1)), with leaders (1,3,4,2), so is counted under a(15).
