%N A374698 Numbers k such that the leaders of strictly increasing runs in the k-th composition in standard order are distinct.
%C A374698 The leaders of strictly increasing runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal strictly increasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.
%C A374698 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.

%e A374698 The maximal strictly increasing subsequences of the 212th composition in standard order are ((1,2),(2,3)), with leaders (1,2), so 212 is in the sequence.
