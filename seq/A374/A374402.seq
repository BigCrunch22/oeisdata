%N A374402 Least number that is the lesser of two consecutive primes p and q whose binary expansions have the same length and agree at exactly n digit positions, or -1 if no such prime pair exists.
%e A374402 a(1) = 2 because 2 = 10_2 and 3 = 11_2 are two consecutive primes that, when written in base 2, both have 2 digits and agree at exactly 1 digit position (each has a 1 in its first digit position), and no earlier pair of consecutive primes has this property.
%e A374402 a(3) = 23 = 10111_2; the next prime is
%e A374402        29 = 11101_2  (same number of binary digits),
%e A374402             ^ ^ ^    and the digits agree at 3 digit positions,
%e A374402   and no earlier pair of consecutive primes has this property.
