%N A374486 Numbers k such that Taxicab(2,j,k) exists for large j.
%C A374486 Here Taxicab(2,j,k) denotes the smallest number (if it exists) that is the sum of j perfect squares in exactly k ways. For sufficiently large N, Taxicab(2,j,k) either always exists for j > N or always does not exist for j > N.
%C A374486 Conjecture: Infinitely many positive integers are in this sequence, and infinitely many positive integers are not in this sequence.
%C A374486 Conjecture: This sequence grows exponentially. Computationally it appears to have asymptotic a(n) = 1.03691*exp(0.594473*n^(1/2)).

%e A374486 For k = 3, Taxicab(2,j,3) does not exist for all j > 9, hence 3 is not a member of the sequence.
