%N A374995 Total cost when the elements of the n-th composition (in standard order) are requested from a self-organizing list initialized to (1, 2, 3, ...), where a requested element at position i is moved to position floor((i+1)/2).
%C A374995 The cost of a request equals the position of the requested element in the list.
%C A374995 After a request for an element at position i in the list (1-based), that element is moved to position floor((i+1)/2). Apparently, Bachrach and El-Yaniv consider the similar strategy where a requested element at position i is moved to position floor(i/2)+1 (MOVE-FRACTION(2) in their terminology). With this strategy, the element at the front of the list will stay there forever.

%F A374995 The sum of a(j) over all j such that A000120(j) = k (number of requests) and A333766(j) <= m (upper bound on the requested elements) equals m^k * k * (m+1)/2. This is a consequence of the fact that the first m positions of the list are occupied by the elements 1, ..., m, as long as no element larger than m has been requested so far.
%F A374995 a(n) = a(A025480(n-1)) + A375000(n) for n >= 1.
%e A374995 For n=931 (the smallest n for which A374992(n), A374993(n), A374994(n), and a(n) are all distinct), the 931st composition is (1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1), giving the following development of the list:
