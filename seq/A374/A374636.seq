%N A374636 Number of integer compositions of n whose leaders of maximal weakly increasing runs are not weakly decreasing.
%C A374636 The leaders of maximal weakly increasing runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal weakly increasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.
%C A374636 Also the number of integer compositions of n matching the dashed pattern 1-32, ranked by A375137.
%C A374636 Also the number of integer compositions of n matching the dashed pattern 23-1, ranked by A375138.

%e A374636 - The maximal weakly increasing runs of y = (1,1,3,2,1) are ((1,1,3),(2),(1)) with leaders (1,2,1) so y is counted under a(8). Also, y matches 1-32 and avoids 23-1.
