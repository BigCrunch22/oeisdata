%N A374763 Number of integer compositions of n whose leaders of strictly decreasing runs are themselves strictly decreasing.
%C A374763 The leaders of strictly decreasing runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal strictly decreasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.
%H A374763 Gus Wiseman, <a href="/A374629/a374629.txt">Sequences counting and ranking compositions by their leaders (for six types of runs)</a>.
%e A374763 The composition (3,1,2,1,1) has strictly decreasing runs ((3,1),(2,1),(1)), with leaders (3,2,1), so is counted under a(8).
%e A374763 The a(0) = 1 through a(8) = 15 compositions:
