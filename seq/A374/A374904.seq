%N A374904 Numbers whose divisors have an integer mean number of divisors.
%C A374904 Numbers k such that A000005(k) | A007425(k).
%C A374904 Numbers k such that A374903(k) = 1.
%C A374904 If k is a term then all the numbers with the same prime signature as k are terms. The least terms of each prime signature are in A374905.
%C A374904 If {e_i} are the exponents in the prime factorization of k, then k is a term if and only if Product_{i} (e_i/2 + 1) is an integer.
%C A374904 1 is the only squarefree (A005117) term.
%C A374904 All the squares are terms.
