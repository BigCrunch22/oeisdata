%C A374366 Conjecture 2: Numbers n such that a(n) = 1 is A000079.
%C A374366 From _Chai Wah Wu_, Jul 06-07 2024: (Start)
%C A374366 a(n) = sum_d A374367(d) where d ranges over all odd squarefree divisors of n.
%C A374366 a(n) = a(A000265(n)).
%C A374366 a(2^k) = 1 as 1 is the only odd squarefree divisor of 2^k.
%C A374366 a((4*m+1)^k) = 0 if 4*m+1 is prime and k > 0 since the only odd squarefree divisors of (4*m+1)^k is 1 and 4*m+1 and a(1) = 1 and a(4*m+1)= -1.
%C A374366 a((4*m+3)^k) = 2 if 4*m+1 is prime and k > 0 since the only odd squarefree divisors of (4*m+3)^k is 1 and 4*m+3 and a(1) = 1 and a(4*m+3)= 1.
%C A374366 Theorem: a(n) is multiplicative.
%C A374366 Proof:  Im(i^k) = 1 if k == 1 (mod 4), Im(i^k) = 0 if k == 0 or 2 (mod 4) and Im(i^k) = -1 if k == 3 (mod 4). Noting that 3*3 == 1 (mod 4), it is easy to verify that Im(i^k) is multiplicative. Since a(n) = sum_{d|n} mu(d)*Im(i^d) and mu is multiplicative, a proof similar to the proof of the multiplicative property of the Dirichlet convolution shows that a(n) is also multiplicative.
%C A374366 This implies that a(n) = 0 if n has a prime factor of the form 4*m+1 and a(n) = 2^(number of prime factors of n of the form 4*m+3) otherwise.
%C A374366 Since A009003 are exactly the numbers that contains a prime factor of the form 4*m+1, this can be written more succinctly as a(n) = 0 if n is in A009003 and a(n) = 2^A005091(n) otherwise.
%C A374366 This means that Conjectures 1 and 2 above are true.
