%N A374380 Numbers b such that the base-b expansion of Pi has two equal digits immediately after the radix point.
%C A374380 The probability that this occurs in a random base-b number is 1/b, so the divergence of the harmonic series suggests this sequence is infinite.  a(28) = 574364584668 is the largest term < 10^12.
%e A374380 2 is a term since Pi in base 2 is 11.00... which has two equal digits 0,0.
%e A374380 114 is a term since Pi in base 114 is 3.(16)(16)... which has two equal "digits" 16 and 16.
%Y A374380 Cf. A000796 (Pi), A336017 (second digit after radix point).
