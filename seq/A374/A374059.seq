%N A374059 a(n) is the smallest integer k such that k*x*y*z = (x + k) * (y + k) * (z + k), 0 < x <= y <= z has exactly n integer solutions.
%C A374059 a(27)=630, a(29)=60, a(30)=420. No solutions were found for n={25,26,28} with k<10^5.
%e A374059 For n=8, a(n)=5 because 5 is the smallest integer such that 5*x*y*z = (x+5)*(y+5)*(z+5), 0 < x <= y <= z has exactly 8 positive integer solutions: {{2,12,595},{2,14,95},{2,15,70},{2,20,35},{3,6,220},{3,10,20},{4,5,45},{5,5,20}}.
