%N A374192 Number of iterations required to reach 1 or 10 in a modified Collatz trajectory where x -> x/2 if x is even, x -> x+1 if x is odd and not divisible by 3 and x -> 3x+1 if x is odd and divisible by 3; or a(n) = -1 if 1 or 10 is never reached.
%C A374192 It is conjectured that this iteration always reaches one of two cycles [1,2] or [10,5,6,3].
%e A374192 n=1 takes a(1) = 0 iterations to reach 1 or 10, since it's already 1.
%e A374192 n=9 takes a(9) = 7 iterations to reach 1, by 9,28,14,7,8,4,2,1.
%e A374192 n=15 takes a(15) = 7 iterations to reach 10, by 15,46,23,24,12,6,3,10.
