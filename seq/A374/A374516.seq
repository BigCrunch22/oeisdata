%N A374516 Sum of leaders of maximal anti-runs in the n-th composition in standard order.
%C A374516 The leaders of anti-runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal consecutive anti-runs (sequences with no adjacent equal terms) and taking the first term of each.
%C A374516 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.

%e A374516 The 1234567th composition in standard order is (3,2,1,2,2,1,2,5,1,1,1), with maximal anti-runs ((3,2,1,2),(2,1,2,5,1),(1),(1)), so a(1234567) is 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7.
