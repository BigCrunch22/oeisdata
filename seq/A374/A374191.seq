%N A374191 Triangle read by rows: T(n) is a permutation of [0, 1, 2, ..., n] subject to an extended Sigrist condition (A280864).
%C A374191 In a series of submissions (A280864, A280866, A375029, A375030) _RÃ©my Sigrist_ studies sequences whose terms are locally connected via their prime factors, i.e., where neighbors influence each other in their divisibility.
%C A374191 Sigrist chooses IN = {1, 2,...} as domain. The triangle discussed here is based on Sigrist's idea but chooses IN = {0, 1, 2,...} as the domain. We recall that all numbers divide 0, but 0 only divides 0. Neither 0 nor 1 have prime factors.
%C A374191 For a row of the triangle T(n) = [T(n, k) | k=0..n] and for a term t in this row, let 't be its predecessor and t' its successor. The terms of a row are subject to the following two conditions:
%C A374191 (1) For all k in 1..n-1 and t = T(n, k), t has no prime factor, or it is not the case that there is a prime factor of t such that (p | 't) <=> (p | t'). Expressed more succinctly (in pseudo-Python):
%C A374191   all(not any((p | 't) <=> (p | t') for p in primefactors(t)) for k = 1..n-1).
%C A374191 (2) If t = T(n, n), then t has no prime factor or for all prime factors of t, (p | t) => (p | t').
%C A374191 The row itself must also satisfy two conditions:
%C A374191 (3) T(n) is a permutation of {0, 1, 2, ..., n}.
%C A374191 (4) T(n) is the lexicographically earliest list among all lists whose terms satisfy conditions (1) and (2).
%C A374191 From _Peter Luschny_, Aug 05 2024: (Start)
%C A374191 On StackExchange (see link), user Bubbler found by exhaustive analysis for n < 29 that only n <= 14 and n = 16 have a solution. Bubbler also states that "since the 4th Ramanujan prime is 29, there are at least four primes that are greater than n/2 (i.e., prime factors that appear only once) when n >= 29 but there are only 3 positions that such primes can go (both sides of 0 and the first element), which proves that there is no solution when n >= 29."
%C A374191 We set all terms of row 15 equal to 0 by convention to make the sequence finite and full. (End)
