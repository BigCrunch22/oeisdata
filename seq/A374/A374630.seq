%N A374630 Sum of leaders of weakly increasing runs in the n-th composition in standard order.
%C A374630 The leaders of weakly increasing runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal weakly increasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.
%C A374630 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.

%e A374630 The maximal weakly increasing subsequences of the 1234567th composition in standard order are ((3),(2),(1,2,2),(1,2,5),(1,1,1)), so a(1234567) = 8.
