%N A374701 Numbers k such that the leaders of weakly decreasing runs in the k-th composition in standard order (A066099) are distinct.
%C A374701 First differs from A335469 in having 150, which corresponds to the composition (3,2,1,2).
%C A374701 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.

%e A374701 The maximal weakly decreasing subsequences of the 1257th composition in standard order are ((3,1,1),(2),(3,1)), with leaders (3,2,3), so 1257 is not in the sequence.
