%N A374250 Greatest sum of run-compression of a permutation of the prime factors of n.
%C A374250 We define the run-compression of a sequence to be the anti-run obtained by reducing each run of repeated parts to a single part. Alternatively, run-compression removes all parts equal to the part immediately to their left. For example, (1,1,2,2,1) has run-compression (1,2,1).
%F A374250 a(n) = A001414(n) iff n belongs to A335433 (the separable case, complement A335448), row-sums of A027746.
%e A374250 The prime factors of 24 are {2,2,2,3}, with permutations such as (2,2,3,2) whose run-compression sums to 7, so a(24) = 7.
%e A374250 The prime factors of 216 are {2,2,2,3,3,3}, with permutations such as (2,3,2,3,2,3) whose run-compression sums to 15, so a(216) = 15.
