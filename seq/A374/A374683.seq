%N A374683 Irregular triangle read by rows where row n lists the leaders of strictly increasing runs in the n-th composition in standard order.
%C A374683 The leaders of strictly increasing runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal strictly increasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.
%C A374683 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.

%e A374683 The maximal strictly increasing subsequences of the 1234567th composition in standard order are ((3),(2),(1,2),(2),(1,2,5),(1),(1),(1)), so row 1234567 is (3,2,1,2,1,1,1,1).
