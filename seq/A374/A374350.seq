%N A374350 Least n-digit reversible prime whose difference from its reversal is minimal.
%C A374350 Inspired by A084475 and A373349.
%C A374350 For n > 1, a(2n) has a difference of 9*10^n and a(2n-1) has a difference of 0.
%F A374350 a(2n-1) = A100027(n) = A028989(n).
%e A374350 a(3) = 101 since its reversal is also 101;
%e A374350 a(4) = 1231 since its reversal is 1321 which is also prime and their difference is minimal at 90;
%e A374350 a(6) = 105601 since its reversal is 106501 which is also prime and their difference is minimal at 900;
%e A374350 a(8) = 10012001 since its reversal is 10021001 which is also prime and their difference is minimal at 9000; etc.
