%N A374429 Triangle read by rows: T(n, k) = ((3*(-1)^k + 1)/2)*abs(qStirling2(n, k, -1)). Polynomials related to the Lucas and Fibonacci numbers.
%C A374429 The idea behind the Fibonacci and Lucas sequences is simple: Put the '2' in the middle of a band and place a '1' to the left and a '-1' to the right. Now add the sum of the two immediate numbers with higher indexes on the left side and on the right side the sum of the two with lower indexes. Schematically, after a few steps, it looks like this:
%C A374429    ..., 18, 11, 7, 4, 3, 1, <-- + [2] + --> -1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...
%C A374429 This generates the Lucas sequence on the left (with a descending index) and the Fibonacci sequence on the right (with an ascending index). The fact that the first two terms (-1, 1) were 'forgotten' in A000045 is only a question of the choice of the offset of the central term. Our choice is, in any case, consistent with Knuth's continuation of the Fibonacci numbers into the negative range (A039834).
%C A374429 This construction is to be captured in a family of polynomials. The idea is that the two sequences are the values of the polynomials at the points x = -1 and x = 1. This continues from A374439. The only difference is that here, we choose signed coefficients and shift the powers up by one. The formal representation is based on the qStirling2 numbers in the version defined in SageMath.
