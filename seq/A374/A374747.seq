%N A374747 Number of integer compositions of n whose leaders of weakly decreasing runs are themselves weakly decreasing.
%C A374747 The weakly decreasing run-leaders of a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal weakly decreasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.

%e A374747 The composition y = (3,2,1,2,2,1,2,5,1,1,1) has weakly decreasing runs ((3,2,1),(2,2,1),(2),(5,1,1,1)), with leaders (3,2,2,5), which are not weakly decreasing, so y is not counted under a(21).
