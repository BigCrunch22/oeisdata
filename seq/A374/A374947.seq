%N A374947 a(n) is the number of suitably connected Legendrian n-Mosaics.
%C A374947 A Legendrian n-mosaic is an n X n array of the 10 tiles given in Figure 5 of Pezzimenti and Pandey. These tiles represent part of a Legendrian curve in the front projection.
%C A374947 A Legendrian n-mosaic is suitably connected if the connection points of each tile coincide with those of the contiguous tiles. Note that the n-mosaic consisting of all blank tiles are considered as suitably connected although it is not representing a link.

%e A374947 For n = 2 there are exactly a(2) = 2 suitably connected Legendrian 2-mosaics, namely the empty mosaic and the Legendrian unknot with maximal Thurston-Bennequin invariant.
