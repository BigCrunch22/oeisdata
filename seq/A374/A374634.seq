%N A374634 Number of integer compositions of n whose leaders of weakly increasing runs are strictly increasing.
%C A374634 The leaders of weakly increasing runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal weakly increasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.

%e A374634 The composition (1,3,3,2,4,3) has weakly increasing runs ((1,3,3),(2,4),(3)), with leaders (1,2,3), so is counted under a(16).
