%N A374260 Decimal expansion of the Euclidean length of the shortest circuit covering all the vertices of the cube [0,1]^3.
%C A374260 It has been proved that it is not possible to join the 8 vertices of a cube with a polygonal chain that has fewer than 6 edges (see Links, Optimal cycles enclosing all the nodes of a k-dimensional hypercube, Theorem 2.2). Thus, any circuit of 6 line segments covering all the vertices of a cube has the minimum link-length (by definition).
%C A374260 Here we consider the additional constraint of minimizing the total (Euclidean) length of the minimum-link circuit (which consists of exactly 6 line segments connected at their endpoints) that joins all the vertices of the cube [0,1] X [0,1] X [0,1].
%C A374260 Let x := (1/2)*sqrt((2/3)^(2/3)*((9+sqrt(177)))^(1/3) - 4*(2/(27+3*sqrt(177)))^(1/3)) + (1/2)*sqrt(4*(2/(27+3*sqrt(177)))^(1/3) - (2/3)^(2/3)*(9+sqrt(177))^(1/3) + 4*sqrt(2/((2/3)^(2/3)*(9+sqrt(177))^(1/3) - 4*(2/(27+3*sqrt(177)))^(1/3)))) = 1.597920933550032074764705350780465558827883608091828573735862154752648..., and then let c := 1+(x+2+sqrt(2))/(2*sqrt(2)*(x+sqrt(2))).
%C A374260 A solution to the above-stated problem is provided by the 6-link circuit (1/2, 1/2, 1+x/sqrt(2))-(c,c,0)-(-c,-c,0)-(1/2,1/2, 1+x/sqrt(2))-(-c,c,0)-(c,-c,0)-(1/2, 1/2, 1+x/sqrt(2)).
%C A374260 The total (Euclidean) length of the mentioned circuit is given by 4*((2+sqrt(2)*x)/2)*(1/x+sqrt(1+1/x^2)) = which is about 11.105251123 and this value cannot be beaten by any other 6-link circuit covering all the vertices belonging to the set {0,1} X {0,1} X {0,1}. This result follows by symmetry from the optimal polygonal chain described in the comments of A373537.
