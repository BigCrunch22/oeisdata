%N A374515 Irregular triangle read by rows where row n lists the leaders of anti-runs in the n-th composition in standard order.
%C A374515 Anti-runs summing to n are counted by A003242(n).
%C A374515 The leaders of anti-runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal consecutive anti-runs (sequences with no adjacent equal terms) and taking the first term of each.
%C A374515 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.

%e A374515 The maximal anti-runs of the 1234567th composition in standard order are ((3,2,1,2),(2,1,2,5,1),(1),(1)), so row 1234567 is (3,2,1,1).
