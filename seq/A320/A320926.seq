%N A320926 Concatenation of successive segments generated by the morphism {0 -> {0, 0, 1}, 1 -> {0}}, starting with 0.
%C A320926 Length of n-th segment: A001333(n), for n >= 1.
%C A320926 Positions of 1: A184118.
%C A320926 From _Michel Dekking_, Aug 10 2022: (Start)
%C A320926 This sequence is a morphic sequence, i.e., (a(n)) is a letter to letter projection of a fixed point of a morphism tau.
%C A320926 The alphabet is {0,1,2}, and tau is given by
%C A320926       tau(0) = 001, tau(1) = 0, tau(2) = 2001.
%C A320926 The letter-to-letter map is given by 0->0, 1->1, 2->0.
%C A320926 One proves easily with induction that the fixed point of tau starting with 2 is mapped to (a(n)) by the letter to letter map. (End)
%C A320926 From _Michel Dekking_, Aug 13 2022: (Start)
%C A320926 This sequence is constructed from the Pell morphism pi: 0->001, 1->0, which has fixed point the Pell word A171588.
%C A320926 The Pell word is a Sturmian sequence s(alpha, rho) with slope alpha = 1 - 1/sqrt(2) and intercept rho 1 - 1/sqrt(2) (See comments of A171588).
%C A320926 By definition,
%C A320926     (a(n)) = lim_{k->oo} 0 pi(0) pi^2(0) ... pi^k(0).
%C A320926 So any word that occurs in the Pell word A171588, occurs in (a(n)).
%C A320926 Conversely, any word occurring in (a(n)) occurs in the Pell word. This one proves by showing by induction on k that the word 0 1 0 pi(0) pi^2(0) ... pi^k(0) occurs in the Pell word.
%C A320926 Conclusion: (a(n)) and the Pell word generate the same language. But then they also have the same subword complexity function, which is p(n) = n+1 for the Pell word.
%C A320926 But a word has subword complexity function p(n) = n+1 if and only if it is Sturmian, so (a(n)) is a Sturmian sequence (a(n)) = s(alpha*, rho*) for some alpha* and rho*.
%C A320926 It follows directly from Lothaire Proposition 2.2.18 that alpha* = alpha.
%C A320926 Conjecture: rho* = 0.085....  (End)
%C A320926 It can be proved that rho* = 3/2 - sqrt(2) = 0.085786437626904951... - _Michel Dekking_, Sep 03 2022
