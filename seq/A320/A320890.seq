%N A320890 a(1) = 11. For all subsequent terms a(n), take a(n-1) and substitute for the k-th digit the binary number of times that digit has appeared in a(n-1), reading left to right from the 1st to k-th digit.
%C A320890 Each term is an initial segment of all of its successors.
%C A320890 There are always more 1's than 0's in a term.
%C A320890 The proportion of 0's or 1's in the n-th term approaches 1/2 as n approaches infinity.
%C A320890 Starting with any binary integer apart from 0 or 1 and applying the same process to yield a sequence s(n), we have that, for a sufficiently large x, a(n) is always an initial segment of s(n+x). The constancy and uniqueness of the limiting behavior of initial segments in base 2 is unique among all bases, unless the tally system is considered as a degenerate case.
