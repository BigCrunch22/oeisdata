%N A320876 Lexicographically first 6 X 6 pandiagonal magic square made of consecutive primes with the smallest magic constant (930).
%C A320876 The same 6 X 6 terms are given in increasing order in sequence A073523. But giving them in increasing order does not contain more information as the smallest of them or magic constant (= sum) itself, which uniquely determines the sequence of primes since they have to be consecutive and their sum is equal to 6 times the magic constant. The present sequence gives the full information about the magic square.
%C A320876 A pandiagonal magic square allows rotations (rather than arbitrary cyclic permutations) of columns or rows, as well as reflection on the 4 symmetry axes of the square. Considering all these variants of this square, there is none with elements coming earlier than (67, 139, ...)
%C A320876 There exist non-pandiagonal 6 X 6 magic squares composed of consecutive primes with smaller magic constant, the smallest being A073520(6) = 484.
%C A320876 Pandiagonal means that not only the 2 main diagonals, but all other 10 diagonals also have the same sum, Sum_{i=1..6} A[i,M6(k +/- i)] = 930 for k = 1, ..., 6 and M6(x) = y in {1, ..., 6} such that y == x (mod 6).
