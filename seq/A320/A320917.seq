%N A320917 a(n) = sigma_2(n)*sigma_3(n)/sigma(n).
%C A320917 Multiplicative, because products and quotients of multiplicative functions are always multiplicative. a(p^k) for fixed k is trivially a rational function of p. The proofs below show that a(n) is always an integer, and hence a(p^k) is a polynomial in p. (Note that a(n^k) is not equal to this polynomial when n is composite.)
%C A320917 Proof from _Robert Gerbicz_ that this is always an integer:
%C A320917 First consider r=sigma_2(p^k)/sigma(p^k). Let x=p^k, then
%C A320917 r=(p^(2*k+2)-1)/(p^2-1)*(p-1)/(p^(k+1)-1)=(p^2*x^2-1)/(p^2-1)*(p-1)/(p*x-1)=(p*x+1)/(p+1)
%C A320917 Case a: k is even, then x==1 mod (p+1), so (p*x+1)==-1+1==0 mod (p+1). So here even r is an integer.
%C A320917 Case b: k is odd, then
%C A320917   sigma_3(p^k)=(p^3*x^3-1)/(p^3-1), and we must multiple this by r, and here
%C A320917   p^3*x^3-1==0 mod (p+1)
%C A320917   p^3-1==-2 mod (p+1)
%C A320917   This means that if p=2 then sigma_3(p^k) is divisible by (p+1), so we have proved the theorem.
%C A320917   If p is odd, then (p+1)/2 divides sigma_3(p^k), but we have another factor of 2 in (p*x+1), because p and x is odd.
%C A320917 It appears that a stronger result is also true: sigma_3(p^k) is divisible by (p+1) if k is odd.
%C A320917 Proof from _Giovanni Resta_ that this is always an integer:
%C A320917 We have sigma_2(p^k)*sigma_3(p^k)/sigma(p^k) =
%C A320917 ((p^(2+2k)-1)/(p^2-1) * (p^(3+3k)-1)/(p^3-1)) / ((p^(1+k)-1)/(p-1)) =
%C A320917 ((p^(k+1)+1) (p^(3 k+3)-1)) / ((p+1) (p^3-1)),
%C A320917 because p^(2+2k)-1 is the difference of two squares and we can use x^2-1 = (x+1)(x-1).
%C A320917 We observe that (p^(3 k+3)-1)) is always divisible by (p^3-1) (it is indeed sigma_3(p^k)).
%C A320917 Now, if k is even, k+1 is odd, so p^(k+1)+1 is divisible by p+1 giving 1-p+p^2-p^3... +p^k as result, and we are done.
%C A320917 If k is odd, k+1 is even and in general p^(k+1)+1 is not divisible by p+1 (just as p^2+1 is not divisible by p+1).
%C A320917 However, if k is odd, then 3k+3 is even, so p^(3k+3)-1 beside being divisible by p^3-1 is also divisible by p+1. Since p+1 and p^3-1 have no common factors, then the ratio (p^(3 k+3)-1)) / ((p+1) (p^3-1)) is an integer and we are done.
