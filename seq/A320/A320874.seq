%N A320874 Lexicographically first 4 X 4 pandiagonal magic square made of consecutive primes.
%C A320874 This is also the 4 X 4 pandiagonal magic square made of consecutive primes which has the smallest possible magic constant (= sum), 682775764735680 = A256234(1). (In the present case there is no other non-equivalent pandiagonal 4 X 4 magic square having the same magic sum, but this could be possible as for rows 7 and 8 of A320872.)
%C A320874 There exist many non-pandiagonal 4 X 4 magic squares composed of consecutive primes with much smaller magic constant, the smallest being A073520(4) = 258.
%C A320874 Pandiagonal means that not only the 2 main diagonals, but also the 6 other "broken" diagonals all have the same sum, Sum_{i=1..4} A[i,M4(k +- i)] = 682775764735680 for k = 1, ..., 4 and M4(x) = y in {1, ..., 4} such that y == x (mod 4).
%C A320874 A pandiagonal magic square allows rotations (but not arbitrary cyclic permutations like, e.g., 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1) of columns or rows, as well as reflection on the 4 symmetry axes of the square (which also produce rotations of 90 degrees around the center of the square). Among all these variants of this square, there is none with elements coming earlier than (170693941183817, 170693941183933, ...), cf. PROGRAM for explicit verification.
%C A320874 The same 4 X 4 primes are given in increasing order in sequence A245721. But does not give more information than smallest term, the central term, or the magic constant itself (cf. A256234) which uniquely determines the sequence of primes (cf. PARI code) since they have to be consecutive and their sum is equal to 4 times the magic constant. The present sequence gives the full information about the magic square, and the given PARI code allows the production of all "equivalent" variants of the square.
