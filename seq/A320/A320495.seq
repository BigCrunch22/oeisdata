%N A320495 Coordination sequence of thinnest 5-neighbor packing of the plane with congruent hexagons with respect to a point of type A.
%C A320495 "5-neighbor" means that each hexagon has a point in common with exactly five other hexagons.
%C A320495 This packing is actually the thinnest 5-neighbor packing in the plane using any centrally symmetric congruent polygons.
%C A320495 More formally, this sequence is the coordination sequence of the vertex-edge graph of the packing with respect to a vertex of type A. (The automorphism group of the tiling has four orbits on vertices, indicated by the letters A, B, C, D in the figure.)
%D A320495 William Moser and Janos Pach, Research Problems in Discrete Geometry: Packing and Covering, DIMACS Technical Report 93-32, May 1993. See Fig. 19.1b, page 32. There is an error in the figure: the hexagon at the right of the bottom row should not be shaded. The figure shown here is correct.
