%N A320542 a(n) is the number of ways to select 3 distinct points forming a triangle of unsigned area = n from a square of grid points with side length n, divided by 4.
%C A320542 Let s(n) be the number of ways to select 3 different points from a square of grid points with side length n such that they form a triangle with absolute area n, then a(n) = s(n)/4. Permutations of the vertices are considered equivalent.
