%N A320137 Numbers that have only one middle divisor.
%C A320137 Conjecture 1: sequence consists of numbers k with the property that the difference between the number of partitions of k into an odd number of consecutive parts and the number of partitions of k into an even number of consecutive parts is equal to 1.
%C A320137 Conjecture 2: sequence consists of numbers k with the property that the symmetric representation of sigma(k) has width 1 on the main diagonal.
%C A320137 Conjecture 3: all powers of 2 are in the sequence.
%C A320137 From _Hartmut F. W. Hoft_, May 24 2022: (Start)
%C A320137 Every number in this sequence is a square or twice a square, i.e., this sequence is a subsequence of A028982, and conjectures 2 and 3 are true (see the link for proofs). Furthermore, all odd numbers in this sequence are squares and form subsequences of A016754 and of A319529.
%C A320137 Every number k in this sequence has the form k = 2^m * q^2, m >= 0, q >= 1 odd, where for any divisor e of q^2 smaller than the largest divisor of q^2 that is less than or equal to row(q^2) = floor((sqrt(8*q^2 + 1) - 1)/2) the inequalities 2^(m+1) * e < row(n) hold (see the link for a proof).
%C A320137 The smallest odd square not in this sequence is 1225 = 35^2 = (5*7)^2 since it has the 3 middle divisors 25, 35, 49 and the width of the symmetric representation of sigma(1225) at the diagonal equals 3. However, the squares of odd primes in this sequence are a subsequence of A259417.
%C A320137 The smallest even square not in this sequence is 144 = 12^2 = (2*2*3)^2 since it has the 3 middle divisors 9, 12, 16 and the width of the symmetric representation of sigma(144) at the diagonal equals 3.
%C A320137 The smallest twice square not in this sequence is 72 = 2 * (2*3)^2 = 2^3 * 3^2 since it has the 3 middle divisors 6, 8, 9 and the width of the symmetric representation of sigma(72) at the diagonal equals 3.
%C A320137 Apart from the powers of 2 in the infinite first row, the numbers in the sequence can be arranged as an irregular triangle with each row containing the finitely many numbers q^2, 2 * q^2, 4 * q^2, ..., 2^m * q^2 satisfying the condition stated above, as shown below:

%e A320137 9 is in the sequence because 9 has only one middle divisor: 3.
%e A320137 On the other hand, in accordance with the first conjecture, 9 is in the sequence because there are two partitions of 9 into an odd number of consecutive parts: [9], [4, 3, 2], and there is only one partition of 9 into an even number of consecutive parts: [5, 4], therefore the difference of the number of those partitions is 2 - 1 = 1.
%e A320137 On the other hand, in accordance with the second conjecture, 9 is in the sequence because the symmetric representation of sigma(9) = 13 has width 1 on the main diagonal, as shown below in the first quadrant:
