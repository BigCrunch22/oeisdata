%N A320272 Indices (starting at 0) of integers in the increasing sequence S of nonnegative numbers that are representable in base 3/2 with digits {0, 1, 2}.
%C A320272 Base 3/2 representations are considered with nonnegative exponents only (i.e., ending at the radix point).
%C A320272 Odd-indexed terms of this sequence form A320035. The sequence S is essentially the same as in A320035 under multiplication of digits by 2 (i.e., under substitution H->1, 1->2).
%C A320272 a(n) is the number of positive numbers less than n that are representable in base 3/2 with digits {0, 1, 2}. - _Max Alekseyev_, Oct 12 2018
%F A320272 For all k >= 1, a(2*k-1) = A320035(k).
%e A320272 The sequence S starts with "0", "1"=1, "10"=3/2, "2", "100"=9/4, "11"=5/2, "20"=3, "101"=13/4, "1000"=27/8, ....
%e A320272 The indices of first four integers in S are a(1)=0, a(2)=1, a(3)=3, and a(4)=6.
%Y A320272 Cf. A320035.
