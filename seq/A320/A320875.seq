%N A320875 Least d > 0 such that both Q = M + 2d and R = M + (M^2-1)/(Q-M) are prime, where M = 2^n - 1 = A000225(n), or 0 if there is no such d.
%C A320875 It is easy to see that R can't be an integer unless M < Q < M^2 + M.
%C A320875 Nonzero terms yield primitive weird numbers (PWN) 2^(n-1)*Q*R, cf. A258882.
%C A320875 This idea was used by S. Kravitz in 1976 and 35 years later by students of CWU to find the largest known PWN, cf. links and A242025, A242993, A242998, A242999, A243003. The 226 digits mentioned in the news article correspond not to a PWN but to the prime R for a(381) = 5456. The corresponding prime Q = M(381) + 2*5456 is the 54th prime after M(381), and only the third one for which R is an integer. The 127 digit PWN they found earlier corresponds to a non-minimal solution d = 34008 for n = 109. (It is a matter of seconds to find many much larger solutions, see examples.) This news led to renewed interest in this topic and a series of recent research papers, see references in A258882 and A002975.
%C A320875 Sequences A242025, A242993, A242998, A242999, A243003 consider PWN of the form 2^(k-1)*Q*R(k,Q) where the prime Q is fixed to be a Mersenne prime A000668, and k is varied to find a prime R.
%C A320875 Zero terms do not mean that there aren't PWN of the form 2^(n-1)*p*q with M+1 = 2^n < p < 2M < q < M(M+1). For example, a(8) = 0, but there are A258333(8) = 53 weird numbers with such (p,q). However, the two primes never satisfy the relation (p-M)(q-M) = M^2-1 which is considered here for (Q,R). - _M. F.
