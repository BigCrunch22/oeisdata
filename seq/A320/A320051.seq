%N A320051 Square array read by antidiagonals upwards: T(n,k) is the n-th positive integer with exactly k middle divisors, n >= 1, k >= 0.
%C A320051 This is a permutation of the natural numbers.
%C A320051 For the definition of middle divisors see A067742.
%C A320051 Conjecture 1: T(n,k) is also the n-th positive integer j with the property that the difference between the number of partitions of j into an odd number of consecutive parts and the number of partitions of j into an even number of consecutive parts is equal to k.
%C A320051 Conjecture 2: T(n,k) is also the n-th positive integer j with the property that the symmetric representation of sigma(j) has width k on the main diagonal.

%e A320051 In accordance with the conjecture 1, T(1,0) = 3 because there is only one partition of 3 into an odd number of consecutive parts: [3], and there is only one partition of 3 into an even number of consecutive parts: [2, 1], therefore the difference of the number of those partitions is 1 - 1 = 0.
%e A320051 On the other hand, in accordance with the conjecture 2: T(1,0) = 3 because the symmetric representation of sigma(3) = 4 has width 0 on the main diagonal, as shown below:
