%N A320809 Number of non-isomorphic multiset partitions of weight n in which each part and each part of the dual, as well as the multiset union of the parts, is an aperiodic multiset.
%C A320809 Also the number of nonnegative integer matrices up to row and column permutations with sum of elements equal to n and no zero rows or columns, in which (1) the positive entries in each row and column are relatively prime and (2) the column sums are relatively prime.
%C A320809 The dual of a multiset partition has, for each vertex, one part consisting of the indices (or positions) of the parts containing that vertex, counted with multiplicity. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,2}} is {{1},{1,2,2}}.
%C A320809 A multiset is aperiodic if its multiplicities are relatively prime.
%C A320809 The weight of a multiset partition is the sum of sizes of its parts. Weight is generally not the same as number of vertices.
