%N A320838 a(0) = 0, a(n) is the number of x such that a(x) = a(n-1) and there exists no y such that x < y < n and a(y) > a(n-1).
%C A320838 After the n-th occurrence (with n <= m) of m after a number larger than n comes the segment of the sequence from the first appearance of n to the first appearance of m.
%C A320838 The first appearance of n in this sequence is given by A002104(n).
%F A320838 Let s(n) be the first time n appears in the sequence, then s(n) = Sum_{k=0...n-1} (s(n-1)-s(k)+1).
%e A320838 Start with a(0) = 0.
%e A320838 No larger number has occurred yet, and the number of 0's since the start of the sequence is 1, so a(1) = 1.
%e A320838 No larger number has occurred yet, and the number of 1's since the start of the sequence is 1, so a(2) = 1.
%e A320838 Still no larger number has occurred, and the number of 1's since the start of the sequence is 2, so a(3) = 2.
%e A320838 No larger number has occurred yet, and the number of 2's since the start of the sequence is 1, so a(4) = 1.
%e A320838 The number of 1's that have occurred since the last appearance of a larger number is 1, so a(5) = 1.
%e A320838 Etc.
