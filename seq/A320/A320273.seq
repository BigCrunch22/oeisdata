%N A320273 Arrange ternary integers in lexicographic order. a(n) is the index of the n-th largest number in this sequence as interpreted in base 3/2 (starting from 0).
%C A320273 Every nonnegative integer appears exactly once.
%C A320273 The inverse is sequence A320274.
%e A320273 The ternary integers are: 0, 1, 2, 10, 11, 12, 20, 21, 22, 100 and so on. The values of these numbers interpreted in base 3/2 are 0, 1, 2, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 3, 4, 5, 2.25  and so on. The values in ascending order are: 0, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.25 and so on. They correspond to indices 0, 1, 3, 2, 9, and so on, which is our sequence.
