%N A320493 Coordination sequence of thinnest 5-neighbor packing of the plane with congruent triangles with respect to a hexavalent point with no symmetry.
%C A320493 "5-neighbor" means that each triangle has a point in common with exactly five other triangles.
%C A320493 This packing is actually the thinnest 5-neighbor packing in the plane using any congruent convex polygons.
%C A320493 More formally, this sequence is the coordination sequence of the vertex-edge graph of the packing with respect to a hexavalent vertex with no symmetry. The base vertex is marked "A" in the figure (it is the apex of a large empty triangle).
%D A320493 William Moser and Janos Pach, Research Problems in Discrete Geometry: Packing and Covering, DIMACS Technical Report 93-32, May 1993. See Fig. 19.1a, page 32. There is an error in the figure: the triangle at the right of the bottom row should not be shaded. The figure shown here is correct.
