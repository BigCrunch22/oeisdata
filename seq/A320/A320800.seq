%N A320800 Number of non-isomorphic multiset partitions of weight n in which both the multiset union of the parts and the multiset union of the dual parts are aperiodic.
%C A320800 The latter condition is equivalent to the parts having relatively prime sizes.
%C A320800 A multiset is aperiodic if its multiplicities are relatively prime.
%C A320800 The dual of a multiset partition has, for each vertex, one part consisting of the indices (or positions) of the parts containing that vertex, counted with multiplicity. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,2}} is {{1},{1,2,2}}.
%C A320800 The weight of a multiset partition is the sum of sizes of its parts. Weight is generally not the same as number of vertices.
%e A320800 Non-isomorphic representatives of the a(1) = 1 through a(4) = 14 multiset partitions:
%e A320800   {{1}}  {{1},{2}}  {{1},{2,2}}    {{1},{2,2,2}}
%e A320800                     {{1},{2,3}}    {{1},{2,3,3}}
