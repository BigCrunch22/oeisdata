%N A320036 a(n) is the number of integer partitions of n with largest part <= 7 for which the index of the seaweed algebra formed by the integer partition paired with its weight is 0.
%C A320036 The index of a Lie algebra, g, is an invariant of the Lie algebra defined by min(dim(Ker(B_f)) where the min is taken over all linear functionals f on g and B_f denotes the bilinear form f([_,_]) were [,] denotes the bracket multiplication on g.
%C A320036 For seaweed subalgebras of sl(n), which are Lie subalgebras of sl(n) whose matrix representations are parametrized by an ordered pair of compositions of n, the index can be determined from a corresponding graph called a meander.
%C A320036 a(n) is periodic with period 12 for n > 40.
