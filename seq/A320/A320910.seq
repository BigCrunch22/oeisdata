%N A320910 a(n)/2^n is the expected length of the longest palindromic subsequence of a length-n binary string.
%C A320910 By subsequence we mean "not necessarily contiguous subsequence".
%e A320910 For n = 3, the binary strings are 000, 001, 010, 011, and their bitwise complements, with longest palindromic subsequence of length 3,2,3,2 respectively, so a(3) = 2*(3+2+3+2) = 20.
