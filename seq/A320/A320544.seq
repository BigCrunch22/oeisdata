%N A320544 (1/8) * number of ways to select 3 distinct points forming a triangle of unsigned area = 1 from a square of grid points with side length n.
%C A320544 Permutations of the 3 points are not counted separately.

%e A320544 a(1) = 0 because no triangle of area 1 can be formed from the corner points of the [0,1]X[0,1] square.
%e A320544 a(2) = 4 because 3 triangles of area 1 can be formed by connecting the end points of any of the 8 segments of length 1 on the periphery of the [0,2]X[0,2] square to any of the 3 vertices on the opposite side of the grid square, making 8*3 = 24 triangles. Additionally, 4 triangles of the type (0,0),(0,2),(1,2) and another 4 triangles of the type (2,1),(0,1),(1,0) can be selected. 24 + 4 + 4 = 32, a(2) = 32/8 = 4.
