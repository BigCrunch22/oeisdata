%N A320212 Number of binary n X n X n permutation arrays (all projections onto 2-dimensional faces yield the all-ones matrix) which yield the all-ones array when repeatedly changing a 0 with three 1 neighbors to 1.
%C A320212 This can be phrased as the number of n X n X n permutation arrays which percolate with respect to the 3-neighbor bootstrap percolation rule in the n X n X n grid. C.f. Balogh, Bollobás and Morris (2009).
%C A320212 The analogous sequence for n X n permutation arrays with respect to 2-neighbor bootstrap percolation is enumerated by the Large Schröder numbers A006318. See Shapiro and Stephens (1991).

%e A320212 One example of such an array is the n X n X n array in which the (i,j,k) entry is 1 if i+j+k is 0 mod n. For n=2 and n=3, the arrays counted by a(n) are precisely the (n-1)!n! arrays that are obtained from this example by permuting rows and columns. For larger n, more complicated examples exist.
