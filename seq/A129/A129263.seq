%N A129263 Skylar (age 7) counts change by stacking all coins of the same type then arranging the stacks in a row. a(n) is the number of distinct Skylar stackings of n cents using any combination of pennies, nickels, dimes or quarters.
%C A129263 Sequence definition and Scratch program to compute the 100 terms due to Skylar Sutherland. Generating function contributed by Andrew V. Sutherland. Related to A001299, but distinguishes permutations of coin types.

%F A129263 Let A_v(x,y) = 1-y+y/(1-x)^v and A(x,y) = A_1(x,y)A_5(x,y)A_10(x,y)A_25(x,y). Let A^(k)(x,y) denote the k-th partial derivative of A(x,y) w.r.t. y. The generating function of a(n) is A(x) = Sum A^(k)(x,0) for k from 0 to 4.
%e A129263 a(16) = 15 = 1+2*4+6*1 since the distinct Skylar stackings of 16 cents are:
