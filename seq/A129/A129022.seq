%N A129022 Isomer numbers for the fluorenoid/fluoranthenoid constant-isomer series.
%C A129022 This allows a single pentagonal ring among otherwise hexagonal rings.
%C A129022 The terms occur in groups of 5: X, X, Y, Z, Y, ..., except for the 0th term (corresponding to the C5H5 series). [Edited by _Petros Hadjicostas_, Nov 17 2019]
%C A129022 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Nov 17 2019: (Start)
%C A129022 From all the papers listed in the Links, the author of this sequence considers Dias (1991) as the basic one for this sequence.
%C A129022 The starting compounds for each constant-isomer series are as follows (with the number of isomers inside parentheses): C5H5 (1), C9H7 (1), C12H8 (1), C15H9 (2), C18H10 (3), C23H11 (2), C26H12 (7), C31H13 (7), C36H14 (9), C41H15 (17), C48H16 (9), C53H17 (31), C60H18 (31), C67H19 (41), C74H20 (72), C83H21 (41), C90H22 (120), C99H23 (120), C108H24 (...), C117H25 (...), C128H26 (...), where "..." means that the corresponding number of isomers is not listed in the papers (probably because they are not known yet).
%C A129022 Starting with each one of the above compounds, the corresponding constant-isomer series is generated by the operator P(C_n H_s) -> C_{n + 2*s + 5} H_{s + 5} successively. For example, the first series is C5H5 -> C20H10 -> C45H15 -> C80H20 -> ...
%C A129022 The starting compound of each constant-isomer series is C_n H_s, where n = s + 2 + 2*floor((1/10) * (s^2 - 7*s + 6)), for s = 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, ... (i.e., we skip s = 6). Thus, a(0) = 1 corresponds to s = 5 (i.e., C5H5), and for m >= 1, a(m) corresponds to s = m + 6, i.e., to C_n H_s, where n = s + 2 + 2*floor((1/10) * (s^2 - 7*s + 6)). See Cyvin et al. (1993, p. 233). (End)
