%N A129686 Triangle read by rows: row n is 0^(n-3), 1, 0, 1.
%C A129686 Alternate term operator, sums.
%C A129686 Let A129686 = matrix M, with V any sequence as a vector. Then M*V is the alternate term sum operator. Given V = [1,2,3,...], M*V = [1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, ...]. The analogous operation using A097807, (the pairwise operator), gives [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, ...]. Binomial transform of A129686 = A124725. A129686 * A007318 = A129687. Row sums of A129686 = (1, 1, 2, 2, 2, ...).
%F A129686 As an infinite lower triangular matrix, (1,1,1,...) in the main diagonal, (0,0,0,...) in the subdiagonal and (1,1,1,...) in the subsubdiagonal; with the rest zeros. (1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, ...) in every column.
