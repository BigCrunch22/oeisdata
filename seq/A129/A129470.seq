%N A129470 Primes p such that the largest prime factor of p+1 has Erd≈ës-Selfridge class+ < N-1 if p is of class N+.
%C A129470 In practice the class+ of a prime p is most often given by 1 + the class of the largest prime factor of p+1; terms of this sequence are counterexamples to this "rule". Terms of this sequence are at least of class 3+, since primes of class 1+ and 2+ have all prime factors of p+1 of class 1+. Terms a(k) of this sequence are >= -1 + 2*A005113(N-1) * nextprime(A005113(N-1)), where N is the class of a(k).
%e A129470 a(3) = 883 = -1 + 2*13*17 is a prime of class 3+ since 13 is of class 2+, but the largest divisor of 883+1 is 17 which is only of class 1+.
