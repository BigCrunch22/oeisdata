%N A129592 The smallest in a triple of three consecutive primes such that the ceiling of the square root of their sums-of-squares is prime.
%C A129592 Can three squares with consecutive prime sides prime(i), i=k,...,k+2, be contained/morphed in a larger square also with prime sides just slightly greater than required?
%C A129592 The areas are the squares of the prime sides; the total area is their sum prime(k)^2 + prime(k+1)^2 + prime(k+2)^2, and pulling the square root is the diagonal of the hosting square. The sequence lists the first, prime(k), if this diagonal (rounded up) is a prime number, indicating that a rather tight enclosing square with (again) a prime side length can be found.

%e A129592 Take 13,17,19 with summed squares 169 + 289 + 361 = 819 = A133529(6). The square root is approximately 28.6 and rounding up to 29 yields a prime, so 13 is a term.
