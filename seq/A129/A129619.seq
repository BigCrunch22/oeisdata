%N A129619 a(n) = largest proper divisor of the sum of all positive integers which are <= n and are not included among the first n-1 terms of the sequence.
%e A129619 The positive integers which are <= 8 and do not occur among the first 7 terms of the sequence are 2,4,5,6,7,8. a(8) is the largest proper divisor of the sum of these integers. 2+4+5+6+7+8 = 32. So a(8) is the largest proper divisor of 32, which is 16.
