%N A129347 Number of inequivalent n-colorings of the 5D hypercube under the set of geometric transformations generated by all possible compositions of the 5 main reflections and the 10 main rotations and their inverses, in any order, with repetition of these geometric transformations allowed.
%C A129347 The formula was obtained by computing the cycle index of the group of geometric transformations, in 5D space, generated by all possible compositions of the 5 main reflections and the 10 main rotations and their inverses, in any order, with repetition of these geometric transformations allowed. The cycle index was obtained through the well known Polya's Enumeration Theorem.
