%N A129899 Smaller member p of a pair of consecutive primes (p,q) such that p^2 + q^2 is ten times a prime number.
%C A129899 How many prime numbers p have a consecutive prime q such that p^2 + q^2 has 10 as a divisor? What is the density of those numbers among the primes?
%e A129899 (7,11) is a pair of consecutive prime numbers. Since 7^2+11^2 = 10*17, where 17 is prime, 7 is in the sequence.
%e A129899 (13,17) is also a pair of consecutive prime numbers but 13^2 + 17^2 = 458 is not ten times a prime number. Hence 13 is not in the sequence.
