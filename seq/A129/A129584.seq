%N A129584 Number of unlabeled bi-point-determining graphs: graphs in which no two vertices have the same neighborhoods or the same augmented neighborhoods (the augmented neighborhood of a vertex is the neighborhood of the vertex union the vertex itself).
%C A129584 This is the unlabeled case of bi-point-determining graphs, which are basically graphs that are both point-determining (no two vertices have the same neighborhoods) and co-point-determining (graphs whose complements are point-determining)
