%N A129542 Number of isolated primes < 10^n.
%C A129542 Isolated primes are primes that are not twin prime components. Define I(n) to be the number of isolated primes <= n. Given that Pi(n) -> infinity and I(n) -> infinity as n -> infinity, proving that pi(n) always grows by an ever so slight factor k>1 than I(n), then we will have infinity_Pi(n) - infinity_I(n) = infinity. So twin primes would be infinite in extent.

%e A129542 The 10 isolated primes < 10^2 are 2,23,37,47,53,67,79,83,89,97 so 10 is the second entry in the table.
