%N A129618 A method of using three consecutive coprimes to generate numbers either one away from a prime or splitting two twin primes. The sequence lists the first of a group of three coprimes.
%C A129618 In 50 trials of trios of consecutive coprimes, nine failed to be within one of a prime; four split twin primes; and 37 were within one of a prime. The results were 37 + 2x4 = 45 prime neighbors from 50 trials. Does this sequence continue to produce primes with a probability greater than mere chance?
%F A129618 The first group is 1,2,3; the 2nd is 2,3,5; the 3rd is 3,4,5 and so forth as the first number increases by one. Place a group of three coprimes a,b and c into a^2 + b^2 + c to see how close the sum comes to a prime.
%e A129618 Take 12,13,17 to yield 12^2 + 13^2 + 17 = 144+169+17=330 which is one away from the prime 331.
