%N A129350 The smallest number in a group of four consecutive mutually coprime integers such that the sum of three of them plus the square of the fourth is prime.
%C A129350 Groups of 4 coprime integers (a,b,c,d) are defined by fixing a, then searching for the smallest b > a such that b is coprime to a, searching for the smallest c > b coprime to a and b, then searching for the smallest d > c coprime to a, b and c. If at least one of the 4 sums a^2 + b + c + d, a + b^2 + c + d, a + b + c^2 + d or a + b + c + d^2 is prime, a is in the sequence.

%F A129350 The groups of four coprimes increase from 1,2,3,5 as the first group, 2,3,5,7 as the second, 3,4,5,7 as the third and so forth. Each group has four chances of producing a prime by squaring one and adding the rest.
%e A129350 Consider the quadruple {17, 18, 19, 23}: 17^2 + 18+19+23 = 349; 18^2 + 17+19+23 = 383; 19^2 + 17+18+23 = 419. Three sum to primes but only one is required put 17 in the sequence.
