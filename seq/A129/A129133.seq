%N A129133 Numbers whose trajectory under the Esucarys map ends at the fixed point 247.
%C A129133 Old title was: "(c,n) is the n-th number for which the Esucarys sequence starting from it reaches 247 and from there keeps indefinitely this value."
%C A129133 The name "Esucarys" is a reversal of "Syracuse", with the generating rule being that for the Syracuse sequence followed by a reversal.
%C A129133 247 is the only known fixed point of the Esucarys sequence. - _Charlie Neder_, Jan 12 2019

%e A129133 For c < 1247 no sequence starting from c except 247 itself reaches 247.
%e A129133 S(1247)=2473, then E(1247) = 3742.
%e A129133 S(3742)=7420, then E(3742) = 247, then (c,1) = 247 and (c,2) = 1247.
