%N A129233 Number of integers k>=n such that binomial(k,n) has fewer than n distinct prime factors.
%C A129233 This sequence, which is much smoother than the closely related A005735, is calculated using the same "cheat" as described in Selmer's paper. That is, after we seem to have found the largest k for a given n, we search up to 10k for binomial coefficients having fewer than n distinct prime factors.

%e A129233 Consider n=3. The values of binomial(k,n) are 1,4,10,20,35,56,84,120 for k=3..10. Selmer shows that k=8 yields the largest value having fewer than 3 distinct prime factors. Factoring the other values shows that a(3)=6.
