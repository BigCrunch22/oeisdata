%N A129651 a(n) is the smallest position k at which b_n(i)<b_n(i+1) for all i>=k, where b_n(m) is the largest order of a permutation of m elements with exactly n cycles.
%e A129651 a(2)=6 because b_2(6)=5 and b_2(i)<b_2(i+1) for all i>=6. (That is, the largest order of a permutation of i elements with exactly 2 cycles is monotonic increasing starting at i=6.)
%Y A129651 Cf. A000793, A129647, A129648, A129649, A129650.
