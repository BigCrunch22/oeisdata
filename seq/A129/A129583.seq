%N A129583 Number of labeled bi-point-determining graphs with n vertices.
%C A129583 A bi-point determining graph is a graph in which no two vertices have the same neighborhoods or the same augmented neighborhoods (the augmented neighborhood of a vertex is the neighborhood of the vertex union the vertex itself).
