%N A129163 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of skew Dyck paths of semilength n and pyramid weight k.
%C A129163 A skew Dyck path is a path in the first quadrant which begins at the origin, ends on the x-axis, consists of steps U=(1,1)(up), D=(1,-1)(down) and L=(-1,-1)(left) so that up and left steps do not overlap. The length of the path is defined to be the number of its steps. A pyramid in a skew Dyck word (path) is a factor of the form U^h D^h, h being the height of the pyramid. A pyramid in a skew Dyck word w is maximal if, as a factor in w, it is not immediately preceded by a U and immediately followed by a D. The pyramid weight of a skew Dyck path (word) is the sum of the heights of its maximal pyramids.
%C A129163 Row sums yield A002212. T(n,1)=2^(n-2) (n>=2). T(n,n)=2^(n-1). Sum(k*T(n,k),k=1..n)=A129164(n). Pyramid weight in Dyck paths is considered in the Denise and Simion reference (see also A091866).

%e A129163 T(3,2)=4 because we have (UD)U(UD)L, U(UD)(UD)D, U(UD)(UD)L and U(UUDD)L (the maximal pyramids are shown between parentheses).
