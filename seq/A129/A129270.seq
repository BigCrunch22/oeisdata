%N A129270 (c,n) is the (n)th integer for which the Esucarys sequence starting from it reaches a term beginning with 4 and ending with 1 and from there grows infinitely. The sequence contains all integers beginning with 4 and ending with 1 (411,421,431,441,...).
%e A129270 for c=1,2,3,4 E(c) reaches 1.
%e A129270 s(5)=16 then E(5)=61
%e A129270 s(61)=184 then E(61)=481
%e A129270 E(481)=4..1 E(4..1)=4...1 and so on with one digit more at each step then (c,1)=5
