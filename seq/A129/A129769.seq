%N A129769 Exponents m(i) for exceptional groups with best guesses for E7 1/2 and E9 added (there is a problem with the dimension of E9 as no sum of odd numbers will equal the 484, I get 483): triangular sequence is: A1,G2,F4,E6,E7 E7 1/2,E8,E9.
%C A129769 Betti number row sums: Table[Apply[Plus, CoefficientList[Expand[Product[(1 + t^(2*a[i][[n]] + 1)), {n, 1, Length[a[i]]}]], t]], {i, 0, 7}] {2, 4, 16, 64, 128, 256, 256, 512} Group dimensions sums: b[n_] = 2*a[n] + 1 Table[Apply[Plus, b[n]], {n, 0, 7}] {3, 14, 52, 78, 133, 190, 248, 483}.
%C A129769 From these exponents it is possible to get Poincaré polynomial estimates for the new E7 1/2 and E8 that best fit the pattern of the known exponents.
