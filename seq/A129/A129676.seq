%N A129676 Permutation sequence generated by the "odious numbers" (A000069), by swapping n-th natural number by the (n-g)-th sequentially, where g=min(odious(n+1)-odious(n)-1,n-1).
%C A129676 In contrast to A128754 and A128756 (which are generated analogously from the primes and the lucky numbers, respectively), this sequence seems consisting solely of fixed points and cycles of length 4,5 and 6. It is also notable that the difference of the number of fixed points and the number of cycles never differs by more than 3, up to index 10000, according to numerical tests. Thus the ratio of the number of fixed points to the number of cycles seems to be asymptotically equal to unity.
