%N A129503 Pascal's Fredholm-Rueppel triangle.
%C A129503 First row of the array = the Fredholm-Rueppel sequence (A036987); which becomes the right border of the triangle. Second row of the array (1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 4, ...) = A104117. Third row of the array (1, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 10, ...) = A129502. Row sums of triangle A129503 = A129504: (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 17, 24, 34, ...).

%F A129503 Antidiagonals of an array in which n-th row (n=0,1,2,...) = M^n * V, where M = A115361 as an infinite lower triangular matrix and V = the Fredholm-Rueppel sequence A036987 as a vector: [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, ...]. The array = 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, ... 1, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, ... 1, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 10, 0, ... 1, 4, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 20, 0, ... (n+1)-th row can be generated from A115361 * n-th row.
