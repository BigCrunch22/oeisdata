%N A129170 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of skew Dyck paths of semilength n such that the sum of the height of the peaks is k (n >= 0; n <= k <= floor((n+1)^2/4)).
%C A129170 A skew Dyck path is a path in the first quadrant which begins at the origin, ends on the x-axis, consists of steps U=(1,1)(up), D=(1,-1)(down) and L=(-1,-1)(left) so that up and left steps do not overlap. The length of the path is defined to be the number of its steps.
%C A129170 Row n has 1 + floor((n+1)^2/4) terms, the first n of which are equal to 0.
%C A129170 Row sums yield A002212.

%F A129170 T(n,n) = A088305(n) = A001906(n) = Fibonacci(2n) for n >= 1.
%F A129170 Sum_{k>=0} k*T(n,k) = A129171(n).
%F A129170 G.f.: G(t,z)=H(t,1,z), where H(t,x,z)=1+z[H(t,tx,z)-1+tx]H(t,x,z)+z[H(t,tx,z)-1] (H(t,x,z) is the trivariate g.f. for skew Dyck paths according to sum of the height of the peaks, number of peaks and semilength, marked by t,x and z, respectively).
%e A129170 T(3,4)=2 because we have UUDUDD and UUDUDL.
