%N A129856 Primes that are one less than the difference between consecutive primes.
%C A129856 Might be called Prime Prime Intervals: the sequence of prime numbers that occur as 1 less than the difference between consecutive prime numbers. - _Barry Forman_, Oct 14 2016

%e A129856 The first 4 consecutive prime pairs are (2,3),(3,5),(5,7),(7,11). The differences - 1 are the numbers 0,1,1,3. The first three of these are not prime so 3 is the first entry in the table.
