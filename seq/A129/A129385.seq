%N A129385 a(n) is the smallest root m of the least perfect power q (= m^k) such that n+q is an even semiprime, or -1 if no such q exists.
%C A129385 If n = 4*d with d > 0 then a(n) = -1: If q is odd then 4*d+q is odd; if q is even then q = 4*x with integer x > 0 and n+q = 2*2*(d+x) has more than 2 prime factors. Consequently n+q is odd or not semiprime.
%C A129385 There are also composite terms. The first two of them are a(122) = 6 and a(161) = 15.
%e A129385 n=0: A001597(2) = 4 = 2^2 is the least perfect power q such that 0+q is an even semiprime; 0+4 = 4 = 2*2, hence a(0) = 2.
%e A129385 n=11: A001597(7) = 27 = 3^3 is the least perfect power q such that 11+q is an even semiprime; 11+27 = 38 = 2*19, hence a(11) = 3.
%e A129385 n=14: A001597(3) = 8 = 2^3 is the least perfect power q such that 14+q is an even semiprime; 14+8 = 22 = 2*11, hence a(14) = 2.
%e A129385 n=27: A001597(1722) = 2476099 = 19^5 is the least perfect power q such that 27+q is an even semiprime; 27+2476099 = 2476126 = 2*1238063 and 1238063 is prime, hence a(27) = 19.
