%N A129832 Integers n such that the n-th cyclotomic polynomial Phi(n) is irreducible over GF(2).
%F A129832 This sequence consists of 1, 2 and numbers having primitive root 2 (that is, numbers that are powers of primes p in sequence A001122, or twice powers of p). - _T. D. Noe_, Jan 03 2008
%e A129832 7 is absent from the list as Phi(7) == (x^3 + x + 1)*(x^3 + x^2 + 1) (mod 2).
