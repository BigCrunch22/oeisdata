%N A129376 Larger cube root in set of successive minima of A^(1/3) + B^(1/3) - C (A,B,C positive integers; A,B not cubes).
%e A129376 a(2)=4 because 3^(1/3) + 2^(1/3) is farther from an integer than 2^(1/3) so 3 doesn't appear;
%e A129376 a(3)=9 because 9^(1/3) + 7^(1/3) is the first term nearer to an integer than 4^(1/3) + 3^(1/3).
