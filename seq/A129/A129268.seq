%N A129268 Slowest increasing sequence: the sum of three consecutive terms shares no digit with any of the summands.
%C A129268 The sequence is finite and has 112 terms. _Max Alekseyev_ (who computed the sequence together with Peter Pein) proved that 175414854, 415748410, and 1631058958 are the last three terms: (Quoting _Max Alekseyev_) Suppose that the next term is x, then the sum s = 415748410 + 1631058958 + x = 2046807368 + x may contain only decimal digit 2. Therefore all solutions are given by the formula x(k) = 2*(10^k-1)/9 - 2046807368 where k>=10. It is easy to see that while x(10)=175414854 is smaller than 1631058958 (hence it cannot be an element of our sequence), all other x(k) contain a decimal digit 2 which is not allowed: x(11) = 20175414854, x(12) = 220175414854, x(13) = 2220175414854, ... Therefore there is no next term in this sequence. QED. (End of quote)
