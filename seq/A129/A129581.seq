%F A129581 Let D(P) be the exponential Dirichlet generating series for the species of prime graphs and let D(C) be the exponential Dirichlet generating series for the species of connected graphs. We have D(P)=log D(C)
%e A129581 Almost all connected graphs are prime graphs with respect to Cartesian product of graphs. So instead of giving an example of prime graph, we give here an example of a connected nonprime graph on vertices {1,2,3,4}:
%e A129581 1 --- 4
%e A129581 | ... |
%e A129581 2 --- 3
%e A129581 The above graph is not prime since it is the Cartesian product of two line graphs of order 2.
%Y A129581 Cf. This is the logarithmic of A001187. Unlabeled prime graphs is given by A129582.
