%N A027854 Mutinous numbers: n > 1 such that n/p^k > p, where p is the largest prime dividing n and p^k is the highest power of p dividing n.
%C A027854 Numbers n > 1 such that n/A053585(n) > A006530(n). - _Michael De Vlieger_, Jul 13 2017
%C A027854 If p = A006530(a(n)) then p * a(n) is in the sequence. E.g., as 12 is in the sequence with gpf(12) = A006530(12) = 3, 12*3^k is in the sequence for k > 0. Conjecture: if m is in the sequence then so is A003961(m). - _David A. Corneth_, Jul 13 2017
%C A027854 At present this and A027855 are complements in the set of integers >= 2. If a 1 were inserted at the start, then this and A027855 are complements in the set of positive integers. - _Harry Richman_, Sep 08 2019
%C A027854 The sequence is closed under multiplication (a semigroup). For, suppose x = p^i*m1, y = q^j*m2 are in the sequence, with p, q, p^i, p^j as given, with m1 > p and m2 > q, and suppose q >= p. If q = p then xy/q^(i+j) = m1*m2 > q. If q > p, then xy/q^j = p^i*m1*m2 > q (since q > p and p is greater than all primes in m1). - _Richard Peterson_, May 29 2022
%C A027854 There are subsequences that constitute subsemigroups: Consider as a subsequence all terms x such that x/p^k > a*p^b, with p,k as specified in the definition and a,b fixed real numbers greater than or equal to 1. Each pair (a,b) determines a subsequence that is also a subsemigroup of the original (1,1) semigroup that constitutes the whole sequence. The proof of closure is similar. To see that such proposed subsemigroups are nonempty, choose any prime p greater than 2 and multiply p by a sufficiently large power of 2. - _Richard Peterson_, May 29 2022
%C A027854 This sequence is a subsequence and subsemigroup of A289484. - _Richard Peterson_, Oct 29 2022

%e A027854 From _Michael De Vlieger_, Jul 13 2017: (Start)
%e A027854 12 is a term since 12/A053585(12) = 12/3 = 4, A006530(12) = 3, and 4 > 3.
%e A027854 30 is a term since 30/A053585(30) = 30/5 = 6, A006530(30) = 5, and 6 > 5.
