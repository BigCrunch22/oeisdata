%N A112738 On the standard 33-hole cross-shaped peg solitaire board, the number of distinct board positions after n jumps that can still be reduced to one peg at the center (starting with the center vacant).
%C A112738 The reason the sequence is palindromic is because playing the game backward is the same as playing it forward, with the notions of "hole" and "peg" interchanged.

%F A112738 Satisfies a(n)=a(31-n) for 0<=n<=31 (sequence is a palindrome).
