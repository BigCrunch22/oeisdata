%N A112435 Next term is the sum of the last 10 digits in the sequence, beginning with a(10) = 4.
%C A112435 Variation on Angelini's A112395. The sequence cycles at a(16)=38 and the loop has 312 terms. It is exactly the same loop as in A112433 "Next term is the sum of the last 10 digits in the sequence, beginning with a(10) = 2" and the first term of this 4-loop is the first term of that 2-loop . Computed by Gilles Sadowski.
