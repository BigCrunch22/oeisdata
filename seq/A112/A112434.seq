%N A112434 Next term is the sum of the last 10 digits in the sequence, beginning with a(10) = 3.
%C A112434 Variation on Angelini's A112395. The sequence cycles at a(21)=36 and the loop has 104 terms. It is the same loop as in A112437 "Next term is the sum of the last 10 digits in the sequence, beginning with a(10) = 6" and the first term of this 2-loop is the 59th term of that 6-loop . Computed by Gilles Sadowski.
%e A112434 a(21)=36 because 2+4 + 2+7 + 2+7 + 3+3 + 3+3 = 36
%Y A112434 Cf. A112395.
