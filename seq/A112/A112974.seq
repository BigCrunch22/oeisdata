%N A112974 Number of superabundant numbers between two consecutive colossally abundant numbers.
%C A112974 The colossally abundant numbers are a subset of the superabundant abundant numbers. Is there a formula for a(n) that depends on the two consecutive colossally abundant numbers A004490(n) and A004490(n+1)?
%H A112974 T. D. Noe, <a href="/A112974/b112974.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n=1..10000</a>
%e A112974 a(3)=3 because between colossally abundant numbers 12 and 60 there are three superabundant numbers: 24, 36 and 48.
%Y A112974 Cf. A004490 (colossally abundant numbers), A004394 (superabundant numbers), A189228 (superabundant numbers that are not colossally abundant).
