%N A112411 a(n) = smallest positive integer, not occurring earlier in the sequence and not equal to n, that has the same number of (non-leading) 0's in its binary representation as n.
%C A112411 Sequence is a permutation of the positive integers. It is its own inverse permutation.
%e A112411 Among positive integers not among the first 8 terms of the sequence, 4 (100 in binary) is the smallest positive integer which has the same number of non-leading zeros in its binary representation as 9 (1001 in binary). So a(9) = 4.
