%N A112536 Natural numbers that can be factored into the product of three positive integers whose minimal sum is achieved in more than one way.
%e A112536 6552 = 14*18*26 = 13*21*24. Each triples' factors sum to 58 (14+18+26 = 58 and 13+21+24 = 58). 58 works out to be the minimal sum for all 3-factorizations of 6552 and there are two of them.
