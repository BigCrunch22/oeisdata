%N A112792 Array where a(1,1)=1 and m-th term of n-th row is number of terms of (n-1)th row which are coprime to the m-th positive integer coprime to n and <=n.
%C A112792 Number of terms in row n is A000010(n).
%C A112792 For the purpose of this sequence, GCD(0,n)=n. Since being "coprime" means that the greatest divisor common to two numbers is 1, 0 is only coprime to 1. [From _Diana L. Mecum_, Aug 07 2008]

%e A112792 The irregular array's 5th row is [2,0,2,0]. The integers coprime to 6 and <= 6 are 1 and 5. In the 5th row there are 4 terms coprime to 1 and there are 2 terms coprime to 5. So the 6th row of the array is [4,2].
