%N A112382 A self-descriptive fractal sequence: the sequence contains every positive integer. If the first occurrence of each integer is deleted from the sequence, the resulting sequence is the same is the original (this process may be called "upper trimming").
%C A112382 This sequence is also self-descriptive in that each element gives the number of first occurrences of integers (X's in the example) that were removed just before it.
%e A112382 If we denote the first occurrence of each integer by X we get:
%e A112382 X, 1, X, 1, X, X, 2, X, 1, X, X, X, 3, X, X, X, X, 4, X, X, 2, ...
%e A112382 and dropping the X's:
%e A112382 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2, ...
%e A112382 which is the beginning of the original sequence.
