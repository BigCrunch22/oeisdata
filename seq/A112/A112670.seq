%N A112670 Smallest positive integer that has a different number of digits in each of the bases 2 through n.
%C A112670 Comment from Jack Brennan: The base of each member seems to be roughly n-O(log n*log log n). The exponent of each member seems to be roughly n*O(log n). The sequence of bases seems to only have differences of +1 or 0. The sequence of exponents seems to only have positive differences.
%C A112670 Does 120 ever appear as a base? (See A112672.)

%F A112670 a(n) >> n^n. For any A < n, a(n) > exp(1/(1/log(n-A-1) - 1/log(n))). - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, May 01 2012
