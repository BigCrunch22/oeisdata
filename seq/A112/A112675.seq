%N A112675 Number of directed Hamiltonian paths on a triangular grid, n vertices on each side.
%C A112675 This sequence counts paths in a triangular region of the familiar 2-dimensional lattice in which each point has 6 neighbors (sometimes called either the "triangular" or the "hexagonal" lattice), visiting every vertex of the region exactly once. The paths are not assumed to be closed. A path and its reversal are not considered equivalent.
