%N A112024 Number of cents in U.S. currency in 2005.
%C A112024 The U. S. Mint actually made 20-cent coins in 1875 and 1876. In 1878, Congress ordered the coins out of circulation, and the Mint melted most of them down. What few 20-cent coins are left are now collector's items that go for a few hundred dollars. - _Alonso del Arte_, Oct 10 2017
