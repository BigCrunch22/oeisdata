%N A112823 Greatest p less than or equal to n with p and q both prime, p+q = 2n.
%C A112823 Essentially the same as A002374, which is the main entry for this sequence. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Jan 25 2010
%C A112823 Well defined only under the assumption that the yet unproved Goldbach conjecture holds, which states that any even N = 2n > 2 has a decomposition as sum of two primes. - _M. F. Hasler_, May 03 2019
%F A112823 a(n) = n - A047160(n). - _Jason Kimberley_, Aug 31 2011
%F A112823 a(n) = n if and only if n is prime, i.e., n in A000040. - _M. F. Hasler_, May 03 2019
%e A112823 From _M. F. Hasler_, May 03 2019: (Start)
%e A112823 For n = 2, the largest prime p <= n is p = 2, and q := 2n - p = 4 - 2 = 2 is also prime, whence a(2) = 2. We see that whenever n is prime, we will have a(n) = p = q = n.
%e A112823 For n = 4, the largest prime p <= n is p = 3, and q := 2n - p = 8 - 3 = 5 is also prime, whence a(4) = p = 3.
%e A112823 For n = 8, the largest prime less than n is p' = 7, but 2n - p' = 16 - 7 = 9 is not prime, so we have to go to the next smaller prime p = 5 and now q := 2n - p = 16 - 5 = 11 is also prime, whence a(8) = p = 5. (End)
