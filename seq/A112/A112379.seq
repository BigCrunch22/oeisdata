%N A112379 A self-descriptive fractal sequence: if 1 is subtracted from every term and any zero terms are omitted, the original sequence is recovered (this process may be called "lower trimming").
%C A112379 The sequence also gives the number of numbers that are retained between zeros that are dropped. Alternatively, each element is the number of numbers between 1's in the original sequence.
%Y A112379 Cf. A112377, A112380.
