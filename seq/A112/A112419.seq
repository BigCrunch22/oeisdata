%N A112419 Prime Friedman numbers.
%C A112419 A Friedman number is one which is expressible in a nontrivial manner with the same digits by means of the arithmetic operations +, -, *, "divided by" along with ^ and digit concatenation.
%C A112419 Ron Kaminsky notes that, by Dirichlet's theorem, this sequence is infinite; see Friedman link. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Apr 30 2010
%C A112419 There are only 49 terms below 10^5, and there are less than 40 "orderly" terms (in A080035) below 10^6. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 03 2015
%H A112419 Erich Friedman, <a href="https://erich-friedman.github.io/mathmagic/0800.html">Problem of the Month (August 2000)</a>.
%F A112419 Intersection of A036057 and A000040. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 03 2015
%e A112419 Since the following primes have expressions 16381 = (1+1)^(6+8) - 3 ; 16447 = -1+64+4^7 ; 16759 = 7^5 - 6*(9-1), they are in the sequence.
%Y A112419 Cf. A036057.
