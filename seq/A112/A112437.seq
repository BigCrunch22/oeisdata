%N A112437 Next term is the sum of the last 10 digits in the sequence, beginning with a(10) = 6.
%C A112437 Variation on Angelini's A112395. The sequence cycles at a(24)=36 and the loop has 104 terms. It is the same loop as in A112434 "Next term is the sum of the last 10 digits in the sequence, beginning with a(10) = 3"; the first term of this 6-loop is the 47th term of that 3-loop and the first term of that 3-loop is the 59th of this 6-loop. Computed by Gilles Sadowski.
%e A112437 a(24)=36 because 1+8 + 2+4 + 2+4 + 2+7 + 3+3 = 36
%Y A112437 Cf. A112395, A004207, A065075, A001370.
