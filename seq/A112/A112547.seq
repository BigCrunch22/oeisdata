%N A112547 Lengths of the loop of the sequences "Sum of last n digits" beginning with (n-1) zeros followed by digit 2.
%e A112547 a(4)=50 because the sum of last four *digits* of the sequence beginning with 0,0,0,2, (three zeros followed by a 2) enters in a loop whose length is 50 terms; so a(4)=50
%e A112547 a(5)=171 because "Sum of last five digits" beginning with 0,0,0,0,2 enters in a cycle of 171 terms.
