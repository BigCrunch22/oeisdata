%N A112090 Degrees of nonconstant complex polynomials f(x) and g(x) such that (1) neither f nor g can be written nontrivially as r(s(x)), (2) f(x) does not equal g(ax+b) for complex numbers a,b and (3) f(x)-g(y) is reducible as a complex polynomial in two variables.
%C A112090 There are no further terms. The proof of this statement uses the classification of finite simple groups.
