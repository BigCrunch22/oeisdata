%N A112355 Triangular numbers that are the sum of three positive triangular numbers.
%C A112355 A112353 is a subsequence: it requires the three positive triangular numbers to be distinct. The positive terms of A076140 are a subsequence.
%e A112355 21 is a term because 21 = 3 + 3 + 15 and these four numbers are positive triangular numbers (A000217(6) = A000217(2) + A000217(2) + A000217(5)). {Also 21 = 1 + 10 + 10 = A000217(1) + A000217(4) + A000217(4).}.
%Y A112355 Cf. A000217 (triangular numbers), A089982 (triangular numbers that are the sum of two positive triangular numbers), A112353, A076140 (the three triangular numbers summed are identical).
