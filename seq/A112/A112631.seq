%N A112631 Rightmost term of each row of triangle A112599. (For n >= 2, a(n) = number of terms in the (n-1)th row of triangle A112599 which are coprime to n.)
%C A112631 It appears that there are no 0's in A112599 after the 6th row. If so, a(p) = p-1 for every prime p except 5 and 7. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Nov 15 2006
%e A112631 The 6th row of triangle A112599 is [5,0,4,0,4,0]. So a(7) is the number of these terms which are coprime to 7. Now 5, 4 and 4 are coprime to 7, but the 0's are not; so a(7) = 3.
