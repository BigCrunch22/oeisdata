%N A306374 Lexicographically earliest sequence starting with a(1) = 23 with no duplicate terms such that the n-th digit of the sequence is not a divisor of a(n).
%C A306374 This sequence doesn't include any term containing at least one digit 0 or one digit 1 as we want the sequence to extend forever.
%C A306374 Any a(1) < 23 would be in contradiction with the definition.
