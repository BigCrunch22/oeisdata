%N A306194 Non-isomorphic colorings of the edges of a cube using at most n colors under rotational symmetries and permutations of the colors.
%C A306194 This uses Power Group Enumeration (PGE). The sequence ceases to grow once it reaches a(12) = 178249 because at most twelve colors can be represented and in a coloring with additional colors beyond the initial twelve the new colors can be permuted out and replaced by colors from the initial set, forming part of an orbit that has already been counted.
