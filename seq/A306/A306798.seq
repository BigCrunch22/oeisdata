%N A306798 Starting position of first subword of length n of the Thue-Morse sequence (A010060) maximizing the number of unbordered conjugates (sequence A321162).
%C A306798 Here we are indexing the Thue-Morse sequence t starting at position 0, so the relevant subword is t[a(i)..a(i)+n-1].
%C A306798 A conjugate of a word x is a cyclic shift of x. A word w is bordered if it contains a nonempty prefix y, not equal to w, that is also a suffix.
