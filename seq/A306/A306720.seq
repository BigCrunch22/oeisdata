%N A306720 Even numbers that are not the sum of two unitary abundant numbers (not necessarily distinct).
%C A306720 The unitary version of A048242.
%C A306720 a(6066) = 530086 is the last term. te Riele proved that every even number larger than 530086 is the sum of two unitary abundant numbers (not necessarily distinct). The corresponding sequence of odd numbers is also finite, but he did not calculate the last term, and only showed that it is below 2004452254833.

%e A306720 Since the unitary abundant numbers begin with 30, 42, 66, 70, ... the first integers which are missing from this sequence are 60 = 30 + 30, 72 = 30 +42, 84 = 42 + 42, 96 = 30 + 66, 100 = 30 + 70, ...
