%N A306670 Numbers k with exactly three distinct prime factors and such that cototient(k) is a square.
%C A306670 The integers with only one prime factor and whose cototient is a square are in A246551. The integers with two prime factors and whose cototient is a square are in A323916, and the subsequences A323917 and A323918.
%C A306670 There are exactly three different families of integers which realize a partition of this sequence. See the file "Subfamilies and subsequences" (& III) in A063752 for more details, proofs with data, comments, formulas and examples.
%F A306670 1st family: The primitive terms are p*q*r with p,q,r primes and cototient(p*q*r) = p*q*r-(p-1)*(q-1)*(r-1) = M^2. These primitives generate the entire family formed by the numbers k = p^(2s+1) * q^(2t+1) * r^(2u+1) with s,t,u >=0, and cototient(k) = (p^s * q^t * r^u * M)^2.
%F A306670 2nd family: The primitive terms are p^2 *q * r with p,q,r primes and cototient(p^2 * q * r) = p * (p*q*r-(p-1)*(q-1)*(r-1)) = M^2. These primitives generate the entire family formed by the numbers k = p^(2s) * q^(2t+1) * r^(2u+1) with s>=1, t,u >=0, and cototient(k) = (p^(s-1) * q^t * r^u * M)^2.
%F A306670 3rd family: The primitive terms are p^2 * q^2 * r with p,q,r primes and cototient(p^2 * q^2 * r) = p * q * (p*q*r-(p-1)*(q-1)*(r-1)) = M^2. These primitives generate the entire family formed by the numbers k = p^(2s) * q^(2t) * r^(2u+1) with s,t>=1, u >=0, and cototient(k) = (p^(s-1) * q^(t-1) * r^u * M)^2.
%e A306670 1st family: 2769 = 3 * 13 * 71 and cototient(2769) = 33^2.
%e A306670 2nd family: 14841 = 3^2 * 17 * 97 and cototient(14841) = 75^2.
%e A306670 3rd family: 1872 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 13 and cototient(1872) = 36^2.
%Y A306670 Subsequence of A063752.
%Y A306670 Cf. A246551 (only one prime factor), A323916, A323917, A323918 (two prime factors), A000396 (even perfect numbers).
