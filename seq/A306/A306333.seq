%N A306333 Last term in each generation of A306211.
%C A306333 The first 65 generations of A306211 were computed explicitly. Since the tail of each generation is the RUNS of the tail of the previous generation, if we start with a complete generation then we can get just the tail of some further generations by iterating RUNS on it. This allowed the computation of the remaining 55 terms.
%C A306333 Generations 11, 16, 25, 42, and 75 end in a 4. The number of generations in between those which end in a 4 is thus 4, 8, 16, 32.
