%N A306803 An irregular fractal sequence: underline a(n) iff [a(n-1) + a(n)] is prime; all underlined terms rebuild the starting sequence.
%C A306803 The sequence S starts with a(1) = 0 and a(2) = 1. S is extended by duplicating the first term A among the not yet duplicated terms, under the condition that [A + the last term Z of the sequence] is prime. If this is not the case, we then extend the S with the smallest integer X not yet present in S such that [X + the last term Z of the sequence] is not a prime. This is the lexicographically first sequence with this property.

%e A306803 S starts with a(1) = 0 and a(2) = 1
%e A306803 Can we duplicate a(1) to form a(3)? No, as a(2) + a(3) would be 1 and 1 is not prime; we thus extend S with the smallest integer X not yet in S such that [X + a(2)]  is not prime. We get X = 3 and thus a(3) = 3.
%e A306803 Can we duplicate a(1) to form a(4)? Yes, as now [a(1) + a(3)] is prime; we get thus a(4) = 0.
%e A306803 Can we duplicate a(2) to form a(5)? No, as a(4) + a(2) would be 1 and 1 is not prime; we thus extend S with the smallest integer X not yet in S such that [X + a(4)]  is not prime. We get X = 4 and thus a(5) = 4.
%e A306803 Can we duplicate a(2) to form a(6)? Yes, as now [a(2) + a(5)] is prime; we get thus a(6) = 1
%e A306803 Can we duplicate a(3) to form a(7)? No, as a(6) + a(3) would be 4 and 4 is not prime; we thus extend S with the smallest integer X not yet in S such that [X + a(6)]  is not prime. We get X = 5 and thus a(7) = 5.
%e A306803 Can we duplicate a(3) to form a(8)? No, as a(7) + a(3) would be 8 and 8 is not prime; we thus extend S with the smallest integer X not yet in S such that [X + a(7)]  is not prime. We get X = 7 and thus a(8) = 7.
%e A306803 Can we duplicate a(3) to form a(9)? No, as a(8) + a(3) would be 10 and 10 is not prime; we thus extend S with the smallest integer X not yet in S such that [X + a(8)]  is not prime. We get X = 2 and thus a(9) = 2.
%e A306803 Can we duplicate a(3) to form a(10)? Yes, as now [a(3) + a(9)] is prime; we get thus a(10) = 3.
%e A306803 Can we duplicate a(4) to form a(11)? Yes, as [a(4) + a(10)] is prime; we get thus a(11) = 0.
%e A306803 Etc.
%Y A306803 Cf. A306808 (which is obtained by replacing prime by palindrome in the definition).
