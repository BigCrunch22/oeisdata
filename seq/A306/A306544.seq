%N A306544 Any positive integer n has a smallest multiple consisting of a succession of 1's followed by a succession of 0's (A052983). This multiple is regarded as a binary number and a(n) is its conversion to base 10.
%C A306544 For any odd number m not divisible by 5 (A045572), Euler's theorem (lcm(9*m,10) = 1, so 10^phi(9*m) == 1 (mod 9*m); i.e., 9*m | 10^d - 1 = 9*R_d with d = phi(9*m)) guarantees that the repunit R_d is always some multiple of m.
%C A306544 The numbers of the form 2^i*5^j with i, j >= 0 (A003592) clearly have a multiple equal to 10^r, for r = max(i,j).
%C A306544 These multiples of n end in a string of one or more 0's, so all the terms of this sequence are even.
%C A306544 The powers 2^k are fixed points of this sequence: the smallest multiple of 2^k consisting of a succession of 1's followed by a succession of 0's is 10^k, and 10^k in base 2 is 2^k in base 10.

%e A306544 The smallest multiple of the integer 7 consisting of a succession of 1's followed by a succession of 0's is 1111110, and 1111110_2 = 126_10, so a(7) = 126. This is also the case for n=13, 14, 21, 26, 33, 35, 37, ...
