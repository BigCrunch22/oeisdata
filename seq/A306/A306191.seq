%N A306191 T(n,k) is a triangular array read by rows.  Let S_n act on the set of size two subsets of {1,2,...,n}.  T(n,k) is the number of permutations in S_n that fix exactly k size two subsets, n >= 1, 0 <= k <= binomial(n,2).
%C A306191 The action of S_n on the 2-subsets of {1,2,...,n} is defined:  For all pi in S_n, pi({i,j}) = {pi(i),pi(j)}.
