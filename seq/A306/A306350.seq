%N A306350 Number of paraphyletic coalescence sequences for 2n lineages, n each in 2 species.
%C A306350 Consider a binary tree evolving in time from a single node until the tree has 2n labeled leaves. Color the 2n leaves in 2 colors, red and blue, assigning n leaves to each color. Suppose coalescences of pairs of leaves happen at distinct times (i.e., no simultaneous mergers). A coalescence sequence is a sequence of coalescence events backward in time, tracing the reduction of the 2n leaves to the single ancestral node. A paraphyletic coalescence sequence is a sequence in which (1) all n red leaves have a common ancestor node that is not the ancestor of any blue leaves; or (2) all n blue leaves have a common ancestor node that is not the ancestor of any red leaves; but not both (1) and (2).

%e A306350 For n=2, consider two red leaves R1 and R2 and two blue leaves B1 and B2. The a(2)=4 paraphyletic coalescence sequences, separated by semicolons, are (R1,R2), ((R1,R2),B1), (((R1,R2),B1),B2); (R1,R2), ((R1,R2),B2), (((R1,R2),B2),B1); (B1,B2), ((B1,B2),R1), (((B1,B2),R1),R2); and (B1,B2), ((B1,B2),R2), (((B1,B2),R2),R1).

%Y A306350 The total number of coalescence sequences for n leaves, from among which the paraphyletic coalescence sequences are identified, follows A006472. Reciprocally monophyletic coalescence sequences, in which conditions (1) and (2) above both hold, follow A306266.
