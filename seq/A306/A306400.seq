%N A306400 For the n-th prime p of the form 6k-1, a(n) is the first prime q for which (p+q^2-1, p+q^2+1) is a twin prime pair.
%C A306400 Actually, there is no need to test for q=2 and q=3, as 6k-1+4+-1 = (6k+2, 6k+4), both terms not prime; and 6k-1+9+-1 = (6k+7,6k+9), with 6k+9 not prime.
%C A306400 The sequence could be extended to nonprime numbers p=6k-1 and/or nonprime numbers q=6t+-1. However, it could not be extended to p=6k+1 (prime or not), because for q=6t+-1, p+q^2 = 6k+1+36t^2+-12t+1 â‰¡ 2 (mod 6); hence p+q^2+1 == 3 (mod 6) is never a prime number.
%C A306400 Proving that this sequence is infinite would prove the twin prime conjecture (that there are infinitely many twin primes), as the twin prime pair associated with the prime p is greater than p and there are infinitely many prime numbers.
%C A306400 This sequence refers to the first q for which p+q^2+-1 is a twin prime pair. However, analysis (by computer program) suggests that for each prime p there are infinitely many primes q for which p+q^2+-1 is a twin prime pair. Proving this statement, even for a single prime p, would prove the twin prime conjecture.

%e A306400 Example: for n=5, a(5) = 11, because the 5th prime of the form 6k-1 is 29, and 29+11^2+-1 = (149,151) is a twin prime pair, while 29+2^2+-1, 29+3^2+-1, 29+5^2+-1, 29+7^2+-1 are not twin prime pairs.
