%N A306787 Prime numbers p such that there exists an integer k such that p-1 does not divide k-1 and x -> x + x^k is a bijection from Z/pZ to Z/pZ.
%C A306787 If x -> x + x^k is a bijection from Z/pZ to Z/pZ then the following facts hold:
%C A306787 -v_2(k-1) >= v_2(p-1)
%C A306787 -gcd(k+1,p-1) = 2
%C A306787 -2^(k-1) = 1 (mod p).
%C A306787 The third fact is very important as it shows that for a given k there are a finite number of solutions p.
%C A306787 If p = 1 (mod 3) and 2^((p-1)/3) = 1 then either k = (p-1)/3+1 or k = 2*(p-1)/3+1 has the wanted property (see sequence A014752 for more information when this happens). It is a sufficient but not necessary condition since 3251 also appears in this sequence but 3 does not divide 3250.
