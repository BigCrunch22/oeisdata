%N A306517 a(n) is the binary number with string structure 10s00, s in {0,1}*, such that it results in a non-palindromic cycle of length 4 in the Reverse and Add! procedure in base 2 and is not in the trajectory of any m < a(n).
%C A306517 It is conjectured that all terms in this sequence are derived from S -> S_a -> 10 T_a 00 -> 10 T_a0 00 when we represent the cyclic patterns by the context-free grammar with production rules:
%C A306517 S -> S_a | S_b | S_c | S_d
%C A306517 S_a -> 10 T_a 00, T_a -> 1 T_a 0 | T_a0;
%C A306517 S_b -> 11 T_b 01, T_b -> 0 T_b 1 | T_b0;
%C A306517 S_c -> 10 T_c 000, T_c -> 1 T_c 0 | T_c0;
%C A306517 S_d -> 11 T_d 101, T_d -> 0 T_d 1 | T_d0;
%C A306517 T_a0, T_b0, T_c0 and T_d0 being some terminating strings.
%C A306517 The strings obtained by S -> S_a -> 10 T_a0 00 are also called (the representation of) "cycle seeds".
%C A306517 It is observed that all strings 10 T_a0 00, with T_a0 produced by the extended right regular grammar with starting symbol T_a0 and production rules T_a0 -> 1010010 T_a0 | 101, are included in this sequence; i.e. the set of seeds in base 2 is infinite if this conjecture is true. Similar observations can be made for any base b = 2^a, a > 0.
