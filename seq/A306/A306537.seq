%N A306537 The least prime q such that Kronecker(D/q) = 1 where D runs through all positive fundamental discriminants (A003658).
%C A306537 a(n) is the least prime that decomposes in the real quadratic field with discriminant D, D = A003658(n).
%C A306537 For most n, a(n) is relatively small. There are only 459 n's among [1, 3044] (there are 3044 terms in A003658 below 10000) that violate a(n) < log(A003658(n)).
%C A306537 Also a(n) is the smallest prime p such that the real quadratic field with discriminant D = A003658(n) can be embedded into the p-adic field Q_p. - _Jianing Song_, Feb 14 2021
%e A306537 Let K = Q[sqrt(635)] with D = 2540 = A003658(774), we have: 2 and 5 divides 2540, (2540/3) = (2540/7) = ... = (2540/37) = -1 and (2540/41) = +1, so 2 and 5 ramify in K, 3, 7, ..., 37 remain inert in K and 41 decomposes in K, so a(774) = 41.
