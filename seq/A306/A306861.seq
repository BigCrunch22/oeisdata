%N A306861 The concatenation kpk is the number obtained by placing k leading and trailing 1's around the prime p; a(n) is the smallest k such that kpk is prime, where p = prime(n), or -1 if no such k exists.
%C A306861 For p = 2,11,37,101 kpk is composite for all k, hence a(n) = -1.
%C A306861 For p = 397 (n=78), 563, 739, 1249, ... no k (<= 12000) has yet been found such that kpk is prime, but also there is no proof yet that k does not exist.
%C A306861 If p = prime(n) is an odd repunit prime, a(n) is half the difference in repunit length between p and the next repunit prime.
%C A306861 Conjecture: There are infinitely many -1 terms in this sequence.
%C A306861 This is a subsequence of A272232. - _Hans Havermann_, May 17 2022

%e A306861 a(1) = -1 because k2k is divisible by the (k+1)-th repunit for all k. The same argument applies to a(26) (p=101). a(2)=1 since 131 is prime, a(3)=1 since 151 is prime, a(4)=3 since 1117111 is prime. a(5)=-1 because k11k is always divisible by 11.
%e A306861 a(12) = -1 because the factor cycle for k37k comprises a covering congruence as follows: k==1 (mod 3)-->3|k37k; k==2 (mod 3)--> 13|k37k; k==3 (mod 3)--> 37|p37p.
%e A306861 For a(78) (p=397) no k (up to 30000) has been found such that kpk is prime.
