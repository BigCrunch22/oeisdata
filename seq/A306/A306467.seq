%N A306467 Let S(n)_k be the smallest positive integer t that t!k is a multiple of n (t!k is k-tuple factorial of t); then a(n) is the smallest k for which S(n)_k = n.
%C A306467 If p is prime, a(p) = 1.
%C A306467 Conjecture: consecutive primes p satisfying the equation a(p+1) = 2 are consecutive elements of A005383 (primes p such that (p+1)/2 are also primes, for p > 3). The conjecture was checked for all primes < 10^4.
%C A306467 Conjecture: consecutive primes p satisfying the equations a(p+1) = 2 and a(p+2) = 3 are consecutive elements of A036570 (primes p such that (p+1)/2 and (p+2)/3 are also primes). The conjecture was checked for all primes < 10^4.
%C A306467 The first six solutions of the equation a(n) = a(n+1) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 27. Is there a larger n? If such a number n exists, it is larger than 4000.

%e A306467 a(8) = 3 because:
%e A306467 - for k = 1 is: 1!1, 2!1, 3!1 are not multiples of 8 and 4!1 is a multiple of 8, then (t = 4 = S(8)_1) <> (n = 8);
%e A306467 - for k = 2 is: 1!2, 2!2, 3!2 are not multiples of 8 and 4!2 is a multiple of 8, then (t = 4 = S(8)_2) <> (n = 8);
%e A306467 - for k = 3 is: 1!3, 2!3, 3!3, 4!3, 5!3, 6!3, 7!3 are not multiples of 8 and 8!3 is a multiple of 8, then (t = 8 = S(8)_3) = (n = 8), hence a(8) = k = 3.
