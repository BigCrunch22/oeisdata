%N A306541 The least prime q such that Kronecker(D/q) >= 0 where D runs through all positive fundamental discriminants (A003658).
%C A306541 a(n) is the least prime that either decomposes or ramifies in the real quadratic field with discriminant D, D = A003658(n).
%C A306541 For most n, a(n) is relatively small. There are only 86 n's among [1, 3044] (there are 3044 terms in A003658 below 10000) that violate a(n) < log(A003658(n)).
%e A306541 Let K = Q[sqrt(293)] with D = 293 = A003658(90), we have: (293/2) = (293/3) = ... = (293/13) = -1 and (293/17) = +1, so 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 13 remain inert in K and 17 decomposes in K, so a(90) = 17.
