%N A306116 Largest k such that 6^k has exactly n digits 0 (in base 10), conjectured.
%C A306116 a(0) is the largest term in A030702: exponents of powers of 6 without digit 0 in base 10.
%C A306116 There is no proof for any of the terms, just as for any term of A020665 and many similar / related sequences. However, the search has been pushed to many magnitudes beyond the largest known term, and the probability of any of the terms being wrong is extremely small, cf., e.g., the Khovanova link.
