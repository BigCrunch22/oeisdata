%N A306892 Isomorphism classes of connected 2-regular digraphs on n nodes, allowing multiarcs and loops.
%C A306892 The graphs are directed, connected and have indegree=outdegree=2 at each node. Multiarcs (connecting two nodes with the same sense of heading) and loops (edges connecting a node to itself) are permitted.
%C A306892 The sequence of the same family of graphs which are not necessarily connected is A006372 (the Euler transform of this sequence).

%e A306892 On n=1 node, the graph is the node with two edges looping back to the node.
%e A306892 On n=2 nodes, the graph is either having two pairs of edges (4 edges in total) linking one node to the other, or a loop at each node and two edges (different senses) from one node to the other.
%Y A306892 Cf. A306827 (no loops).
