%N A306583 Positive integers that cannot be represented as a sum or difference of factorials of distinct integers.
%C A306583 It can be proved that any number in the gap between n! + (n-1)! + (n-2)! + ... + 2! + 1! + 0! and (n+1)! - (n! + (n-1)! + (n-2)! + ... + 2! + 1! + 0!) is in this sequence.
%C A306583 0! and 1! are treated as distinct. - _Bernard Schott_, Feb 25 2019
%e A306583 10 can be represented as 10 = 0! + 1! + 2! + 3!, so it is not a term.
%e A306583 11 cannot be represented as a sum or a difference of factorials, so it is a term.
