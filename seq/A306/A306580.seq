%N A306580 An irregular fractal sequence: underline all terms that share at least one digit with the preceding one. All underlined terms rebuild the starting sequence. (See the Comments section for more details.)
%C A306580 The sequence S starts with a(1) = 0 and a(2) = 1. S is extended by duplicating the first term A among the not yet duplicated terms, under the condition that A shares at least one digit with the last term Z of the sequence. If A doesn't share any digit with Z, we then extend the sequence with the smallest integer X not yet present in S and not sharing a digit with Z.
