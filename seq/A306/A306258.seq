%N A306258 a(n) = floor(n^2/4)*n!.
%C A306258 a(n) is the total displacement of all letters in all permutations on n letters as if the first letter were connected to the last letter, forming a loop.
%C A306258 For the sequence A090672 the displacement of the permutation "0123" is 0, while that of the permutation "3210" is 8 because each of the digits 0 and 3 is 3 places away from its original place and each of the digits 1 and 2 is one place away, so the total displacement is 3+1+1+3 = 8.
%C A306258 In this sequence, however, the displacement is calculated differently: that of "0123" is 0 as before, but the displacement of "3210" is no longer 8 because the first index and last index are connected, forming a loop; each of the digits 0 and 3 is now 1 place away from its original place (and each of the digits 1 and 2 is one place away, as before), so the total displacement is calculated as 1+1+1+1 = 4.
