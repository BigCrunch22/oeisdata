%N A001198 Zarankiewicz's problem k_3(n).
%C A001198 Guy denotes k_{a,b}(m,n) the least k such that any m X n matrix with k '1's and '0's elsewhere has an a X b submatrix with all '1's, and omits b (resp. n) when b = a (resp. n = m). With this notation, a(n) = k_3(n). Sierpiński (1951) found a(4..6), a(7) is due to Brzeziński and a(8) due to Čulík (1956). - _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 28 2021

%e A001198 From _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 28 2021: (Start)
%e A001198 For n = 3 it is clearly necessary and sufficient that there be 3 X 3 = 9 ones in the n X n matrix in order to have an all-ones 3 X 3 submatrix.
%e A001198 For n = 4 there may be at most 2 zeros in the 4 X 4 matrix in order to be guaranteed to have a 3 X 3 submatrix with all '1's, whence a(4) = 16 - 2 = 14: If 3 zeros are placed on a diagonal, it is no more possible to find a 3 X 3 all-ones submatrix, but if there are at most 2 zeros, one always has such a submatrix, as one can see from the following two diagrams:

%e A001198      Here one can delete, e.g.,   ->   1 0 1 1        1 0 1 1  <-  all-ones
