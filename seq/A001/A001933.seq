%N A001933 Number of chessboard polyominoes with n squares.
%C A001933 Chessboard-colored polyominoes, considering to be distinct two shapes that cannot be mapped onto each other by any form of symmetry. For example, there are two distinct monominoes, one black, one white. There is only one domino, with one black square, and one white. - _John Mason_, Nov 25 2013
