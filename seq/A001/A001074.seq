%N A001074 Numbers m such that Sum_{k=0..m-1} exp(2*Pi*i*k^3/m) != 0.
%C A001074 Mark m points around a horizontal disk with labels 0..m-1; place coins at positions k^3 mod m for k=0..m-1; sequence gives values of m for which the disk is not balanced.

%e A001074 8 is in the sequence because 4 coins go at 0, and 1 each at 1, 3, 5, 7, so the disk is unbalanced in the direction of point 0.
%e A001074 12 is not in the sequence because there are 2 coins at 0, 4, 8 and 1 coin at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, so the disk is balanced.
