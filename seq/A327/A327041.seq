%N A327041 a(n) is the number whose binary indices are the union of the set-system with BII-number n.
%C A327041 A binary index of n is any position of a 1 in its reversed binary expansion. The binary indices of n are row n of A048793. We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. Every set-system has a different BII-number. For example, 18 has reversed binary expansion (0,1,0,0,1), and since the binary indices of 2 and 5 are {2} and {1,3} respectively, the BII-number of {{2},{1,3}} is 18.

%e A327041 22 is the BII-number of {{2},{1,2},{1,3}}, and 7 has binary indices {1,2,3}, so a(22) = 7.
