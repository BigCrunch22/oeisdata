%N A327734 Number of n-bead bracelet structures using exactly two different colored beads that are not self-equivalent under either a nonzero rotation or reversal (turning over bracelet).
%e A327734 Case n=7: There are 7 necklace structures using exactly two colors. See example in A056295. Of these, 5 are achiral and the other two a chiral pair: AAABABB/AAABBAB. a(7) = 1, since this sequence considers chiral pairs as the same bracelet structure.
