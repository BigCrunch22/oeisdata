%N A327819 Elements of the unique smallest MSTD set of primes.
%C A327819 This set is smallest in terms of minimizing the maximum element.
%C A327819 Chu, McNew, Miller, Xu, & Zhang show that, as a consequence of the Green-Tao theorem, there are infinitely many MSTD sets of primes, and give an example. Chu finds this set and proves minimality, answering a question of the former authors.
