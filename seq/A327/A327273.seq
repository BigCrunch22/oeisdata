%N A327273 An upper bound sequence for A327272.
%C A327273 a(n) can be calculated by a faster algorithm than that for A327272(n). It gives a small (but not necessarily smallest) positive determinant with top row [1,2,2^2,...,2^n] and all entries integers, and rows orthogonal. Note that a(n) = A327272(n) for n=0,1 and 3. See Pinner and Smyth link below for both algorithms, and more details of the sequences.

%e A327273 a(2) = 105 since the algorithm for a(n) produces the determinant([[1,2,4],[2,-1,0],[4,8,-5]]) = 105, having top row [1,2,2^2] and all rows orthogonal.
