%N A327296 a(n) is the decimal value of the largest binary palindrome that can be obtained from the digits of the binary representation of n.
%C A327296 a(n) is the largest-valued binary palindrome that can be constructed from the binary representation of n. The palindrome may not have a leading 0.
%C A327296 When constructing a palindrome from a binary string, digits may only be permuted and deleted. I.e., the constructed palindrome will contain the same number or fewer 1's and 0's as the original binary string.
%C A327296 The algorithm is as follows:
%C A327296 If there is an odd number of 1's in the original binary string, start by placing a 1 in the middle of the output palindrome. Note that the remaining number of 1's is now even. If the remaining number of 1's is zero, then the constructed palindrome is simply "1" because the constructed palindrome cannot have leading zeros. If the remaining number of 1's is greater than zero, then place the remaining 0's evenly on either side of the previously placed "1". Because the output must be a palindrome, if the original string contains an odd number of 0's, then one of the 0's will be discarded. Lastly, place the remaining 1's on either end of the constructed palindrome.
%C A327296 If there is an even number of 1's in the original binary string, start by placing all of the 0's from the original string in the center of the palindrome, then place the 1's evenly on either side of the 0's.

%e A327296 The largest palindrome that can be constructed:
%e A327296 For 101  it is  101, thus a(5)  = 5.
%e A327296 For 1000 it is    1, thus a(8)  = 1.
%e A327296 For 1010 it is 1001, thus a(10) = 9.
%e A327296 For 1011 it is  111, thus a(11) = 7.
