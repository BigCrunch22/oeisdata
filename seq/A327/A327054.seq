%N A327054 a(n) is the smallest number m such that the antiharmonic mean of the divisors is n, or 0 if no such m exists.
%C A327054 a(n) = the smallest number m such that sigma_2(n) / sigma_1(n) = A001157(m) / A000203(m) = n, or 0 if no such m exists.
%C A327054 Zeros occur if n is not in A176799.
%C A327054 See A000290, A091911 and A162538 for like sequences for geometric, arithmetic and harmonic means of the divisors.
%e A327054 a(3) = 4 because 4 is the smallest number m with sigma_2(m) / sigma_1(m) = 3; sigma_2(4) / sigma_1(4) = 21 / 7 = 3.
