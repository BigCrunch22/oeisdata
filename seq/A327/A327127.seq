%N A327127 Triangle read by rows where T(n,k) is the number of unlabeled simple graphs with n vertices where k is the minimum number of vertices that must be removed (along with any incident edges) to obtain a disconnected or empty graph.
%C A327127 A graph with one vertex and no edges is considered to be connected. Except for complete graphs, this is the same as vertex-connectivity (A259862).
%C A327127 There are two ways to define (vertex) connectivity: the minimum size of a vertex cut, and the minimum of the maximum number of internally disjoint paths between two distinct vertices. For non-complete graphs they coincide, which is tremendously useful. For complete graphs with at least 2 vertices, there are no cuts but the second method still works so it is customary to use it to justify the connectivity of K_n being n-1. - _Brendan McKay_, Aug 28 2019.
