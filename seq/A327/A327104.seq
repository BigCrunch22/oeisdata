%N A327104 Maximum vertex-degree of the set-system with BII-number n.
%C A327104 A binary index of n is any position of a 1 in its reversed binary expansion. The binary indices of n are row n of A048793. We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. Every set-system (finite set of finite nonempty sets) has a different BII-number. For example, 18 has reversed binary expansion (0,1,0,0,1), and since the binary indices of 2 and 5 are {2} and {1,3} respectively, the BII-number of {{2},{1,3}} is 18. Elements of a set-system are sometimes called edges.
%C A327104 In a set-system, the degree of a vertex is the number of edges containing it.
%e A327104 The BII-number of {{2},{3},{1,2},{1,3},{2,3}} is 62, and its degrees are (2,3,3), so a(62) = 3.
