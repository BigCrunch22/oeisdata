%N A327823 Odd integers m such that every odd integer k with 1 < k < m and gcd(k,m) = 1 is prime.
%C A327823 Solomon W. Golomb and Kee-Wai Lau prove in AMM (see link) that the greatest odd integer with this property is 105.
%C A327823 This sequence is inspirated by the other one: integers q such that every integer k with 1 < k < q and gcd(k,q) = 1 is prime, with 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30 in A048597 \ {1}.
%C A327823 The terms 1 and 3 are added after recommendations of _Amiram Eldar_ and _Michel Marcus_.

%e A327823 For m = 15 and 1 < k odd < 15, we have gcd(3,15) = 3, gcd(5,15) = 5, gcd(7,15) = 1, gcd(9,15) = 3, gcd(11,15) = 1, gcd(13,15) = 1. So, gcd(k,15) = 1 only if k is prime and 15 is a term.
%e A327823 For m = 63, we have gcd(25,63) = 1 with 25 no prime, so 63 is not a term.
