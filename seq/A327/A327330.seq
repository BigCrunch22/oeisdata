%N A327330 "Concave pentagon" toothpick sequence (see Comments for precise definition).
%C A327330 This arises from a hybrid cellular automaton on a triangular grid formed of I-toothpicks (A160164) and V-toothpicks (A161206).
%C A327330 The surprising fact is that after 2^k stages the structure looks like a concave pentagon, which is formed essentially by an equilateral triangle (E) surrounded by two quadrilaterals (Q1 and Q2), both with their largest sides in vertical position, as shown below:

%C A327330 Note that for n >> 1 both quadrilaterals look like right triangles.
%C A327330 Every polygon has a slight resemblance to Sierpinsky's triangle, but here the structure is much more complex.
%C A327330 For the construction of the sequence the rules are as follows:
%C A327330 On the infinite triangular grid at stage 0 there are no toothpicks, so a(0) = 0.
%C A327330 At stage 1 we place an I-toothpick formed of two single toothpicks in vertical position, so a(1) = 1.
%C A327330 For the next n generation we have that:
%C A327330 If n is even then at every free end of the structure we add a V-toothpick, formed of two single toothpicks, with its central vertex directed upward, like a gable roof.
%C A327330 If n is odd then we add I-toothpicks in vertical position (see the example).
%C A327330 a(n) gives the total number of I-toothpicks and V-toothpicks in the structure after the n-th stage.
%C A327330 A327331 (the first differences) gives the number of elements added at the n-th stage.
%C A327330 2*a(n) gives the total number of single toothpicks of length 1 after the n-th stage.
%C A327330 The structure contains many kinds of polygonal regions, for example: triangles, trapezes, parallelograms, regular hexagons, concave hexagons, concave decagons, concave 12-gons, concave 18-gons, concave 20-gons, and other polygons.
%C A327330 The structure is almost identical to the structure of A327332, but a little larger at the upper edge.
%C A327330 The behavior seems to suggest that this sequence can be calculated with a formula, in the same way as A139250, but that is only a conjecture.
%C A327330 The "word" of this cellular automaton is "ab". For more information about the word of cellular automata see A296612.
%C A327330 For another version, very similar, starting with a V-toothpick, see A327332, which it appears that shares infinitely many terms with this sequence.

%e A327330 After three generations there are five I-toothpicks and two V-toothpicks in the structure, so a(3) = 5 + 2 = 7 (note that in total there are 2*a(3) = 2*7 = 14 single toothpicks of length 1).
