%N A327170 Number of divisors d of n such that A327171(d) (= phi(d)*core(d)) is equal to n.
%C A327170 From any solution (*) to A327171(d) = d*phi(d) = n, we obtain a solution for core(d')*phi(d') = n by forming a "pumped up" version d' of d, by replacing each exponent e_i in the prime factorization of d = p_1^e_1 * p_2^e_2 * ... * p_k^e_k, with exponent 2*e_i - 1 so that d' = p_1^(2*e_1 - 1) * p_2^(2*e_2 - 1)* ... * p_k^(2*e_k - 1) = A102631(d) = d*A003557(d), and this d' is also a divisor of n, as n = d' * A173557(d). Generally, any product m = p_1^(2*e_1 - x) * p_2^(2*e_2 - y)* ... * p_k^(2*e_k - z), where each x, y, ..., z is either 0 or 1 gives a solution for core(m)*phi(m) = n, thus every nonzero term in this sequence is a power of 2, even though not all such m's might be divisors of n.
%C A327170   (* by necessity unique, see _Franz Vrabec_'s Dec 12 2012 comment in A002618).
%C A327170 On the other hand, if we have any solution d for core(d)*phi(d) = n, we can find the unique such divisor e of d that e*phi(e) = n by setting e = A019554(d).
%C A327170 Thus, it follows that the nonzero terms in this sequence occur exactly at positions given by A082473.

%e A327170 For n = 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7, it has 24 divisors, out of which four divisors: 42 (= 2^1 * 3^1 * 7^1), 84 (= 2^2 * 3^1 * 7^1), 126 (= 2^1 * 3^2 * 7^1), 252 (= 2^2 * 3^2 * 7^1) are such that A007913(d)*A000010(d) = 504, thus a(504) = 4.
