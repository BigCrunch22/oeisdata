%N A327102 BII-numbers of set-systems with non-spanning edge-connectivity >= 2.
%C A327102 A binary index of n is any position of a 1 in its reversed binary expansion. The binary indices of n are row n of A048793. We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. Every set-system (finite set of finite nonempty sets) has a different BII-number. For example, 18 has reversed binary expansion (0,1,0,0,1), and since the binary indices of 2 and 5 are {2} and {1,3} respectively, the BII-number of {{2},{1,3}} is 18. Elements of a set-system are sometimes called edges.
%C A327102 A set-system has non-spanning 2-edge-connectivity >= 2 if it is connected and any single edge can be removed (along with any non-covered vertices) without making the set-system disconnected or empty. Alternatively, these are connected set-systems whose bridges (edges whose removal disconnects the set-system or leaves isolated vertices) are all endpoints (edges intersecting only one other edge).
