%N A327565 Number of transfers of marbles between two sets until the first repetition.
%C A327565 There are initially n marbles in both sets. In the first turn, half of the marbles of set A are transferred to set B, rounding to the upper integer when halving. In the second turn, half of the marbles of set B are transferred back to set A, following the same rule. The game goes on back and forth until we reach a distribution already encountered.
%C A327565 a(n) is then the number of steps until the first repetition occurs.
%C A327565 First occurrence of a(n) = m > 1 in this sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 17, 33, 65, 129, 257, 513, 1025, 2049...
%C A327565 Conjecture: for m > 2, the first occurrence of a(n) = m is for n = 2^(m-3) + 1.
%F A327565 For m > 1, first occurrence of a(n) = m is for n = A094373(m-1) (conjectured).
%e A327565 For n = 3, (SetA ; SetB):
%e A327565 (3 ; 3), ceiling(3/2)=2 marbles get transferred,
%e A327565 (1 ; 5), ceiling(5/2)=3 marbles get transferred,
%e A327565 (4 ; 2), ceiling(4/2)=2 marbles get transferred,
%e A327565 (2 ; 4), ceiling(4/2)=2 marbles get transferred,
%e A327565 (4 ; 2), this is a repetition, it took 4 steps to get there, so a(3) = 4.
%e A327565 For n = 9, (SetA ; SetB):
%e A327565 (9 ; 9), (4 ; 14), (11 ; 7), (5 ; 13), (12 ; 6), (6 ; 12), (12 ; 6) which is a repetition, so a(9) = 6.
