%N A327262 a(n) is the sum of all parts of all partitions of n into consecutive parts that differ by 4.
%C A327262 The one-part partition n = n is included in the count.
%F A327262 a(n) = n*A334461(n).
%e A327262 For n = 28 there are three partitions of 28 into consecutive parts that differ by 4, including 28 as a valid partition. They are [28], [16, 12] and [13, 9, 5, 1]. The sum of the parts is [28] + [16 + 12] + [13 + 9 + 5 + 1] = 84, so a(28) = 84.
