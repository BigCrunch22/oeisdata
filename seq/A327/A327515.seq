%N A327515 Number of steps to reach a fixed point starting with n and repeatedly taking the quotient by the maximum divisor that is 1, 2, or a nonprime number whose prime indices are pairwise coprime (A327512, A327514).
%C A327515 Positions of zeros are A289509.
%C A327515 First term > 1 is a(225) = 2.
%C A327515 First zero not in A318978 is a(17719) = 0.
%C A327515 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798. Numbers that are 1, 2, or a nonprime number whose prime indices are pairwise coprime are listed in A302696.

%F A327515 a(15^n) = n.
%e A327515 We have 50625 -> 3375 -> 225 ->  15 -> 1, so a(50625) = 4.
