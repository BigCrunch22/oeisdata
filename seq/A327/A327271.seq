%N A327271 Smallest modulus of any n X n integer determinant whose top row has all 1's and whose rows are pairwise orthogonal.
%C A327271 a(n) = A327267(2^n), since 2^n = (p_1)^n is the Heinz code for the multiset {1,1,...,1}.
%C A327271 See Pinner and Smyth link below for more details, including an algorithm for computing A327267(n). Also, see file link below for {(n, a(n), matrix(n)), n <= 13}, where matrix(n) has minimal modulus determinant equal to a(n) among n X n matrices with top row all 1's and all rows orthogonal.
%C A327271 For the first 13 terms, the number of prime factors counted with multiplicity equals n-1: A001222(a(n))=n-1. How far does this hold? - _Jon Maiga_, Sep 07 2019

%e A327271 a(3) = 6 because the matrix [[1,1,1],[1,-1,0],[1,1,-2]] has top row of 3 1's and all rows orthogonal, and minimal positive determinant equal to 6.
%Y A327271 Subsequence of A327267, see comments; A327273 is similar, but determinant's top row is 1,2,2^2,...,2^{n-1}.
