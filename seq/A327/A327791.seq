%N A327791 Number of ways, up to order, of decomposing (Z/nZ)* as the internal direct product of r cyclic subgroups, where r = rank((Z/nZ)*).
%C A327791 In general, let G be a finite abelian group and r = rank(G), let s be the number of arrays (k_1, k_2, ..., k_r) such that G = C_(k_1) X C_(k_2) X ... X C_(k_r). We can see from A302257 that:
%C A327791 (a) Given (k'_1, k'_2, ..., k'_r) such that G = C_(k'_1) X C_(k'_2) X ... X C_(k'_r), the number of arrays (a_1, a_2, ..., a_r) such that G = <a_1> X <a_2> X ... <a_r> and that ord(a_i) = k'_i is |Aut(G)|, where <a> is the subgroup of G generated by a. This is because if one group of such (a_1, a_2, ..., a_r) is found, all the others can be found by group automorphism. As a result, the number of sets {a_1, a_2, ..., a_r} such that G = <a_1> X <a_2> X ... <a_r> is |Aut(G)|*s/r!. As (k'_1, k'_2, ..., k'_r) runs through all the s possible choices, each array (a_1, a_2, ..., a_r) such that G = <a_1> X <a_2> X ... <a_r> occurs exactly once, giving a total of |Aut(G)|*s arrays. But the elements in a set are unordered, so the number of sets is |Aut(G)|*s/r!;
%C A327791 (b) Let M = Product_{i=1..r} phi(k_i), then the number of sets {H_1, H_2, ..., H_r} such that G = H_1 X H_2 X ... X H_r is (|Aut(G)|*s/r!)/M. Given {H_1, H_2, ..., H_r} such that G = H_1 X H_2 X ... X H_r, there are phi(|H_i|) ways to choose a generator of H_i, that is, there are Product_{i=1..r} phi(|H_i|) sets {a_1, a_2, ..., a_r} such that <a_i> = H_i.  From (a), the total number of sets {a_1, a_2, ..., a_r} as {H_1, H_2, ..., H_r} runs through all possible choices is |Aut(G)|*s/r!.  Note that Product_{i=1..r} phi(|H_i|) is always equal to M regardless of the choice of {H_1, H_2, ..., H_r}. That is to say, each set of cyclic subgroups {H_1, H_2, ..., H_r} corresponds to M sets of generators {a_1, a_2, ..., a_r}. Thus, the number of sets {H_1, H_2, ..., H_r} is (|Aut(G)|*s/r!)/M.
