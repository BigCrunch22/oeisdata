%N A327844 Table read by antidiagonals: the m-th row gives the sequence constructed by repeatedly choosing the smallest positive number not already in the row such that for each k = 1, ..., m, the k-th differences are distinct.
%C A327844 First row is A175498. Main diagonal is A327743.
%C A327844 The index of where the m-th row first differs from A327743 is 6, 15, 15, 16, 16, 194, 301, 301, 1036, 1036, 1036, 1037, ...
%C A327844 For example, T(6, 194) != A327743(194), but T(6, n) = A327743(n) for n < 194.
