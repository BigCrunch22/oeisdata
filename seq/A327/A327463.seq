%N A327463 a(1) = 1; thereafter, a(n) is the reversal of the next prime after a(n - 1) in base 6 if n is prime, and the reversal of the next composite after a(n - 1) in base 6 if n is composite.
%C A327463 The sequence is written in base 10.
%C A327463 Conjecture: a(n) <= 5.
%Y A327463 For bases 3,5,6,7,10 see A326894, A327464, A327463 = the present sequence, A327241, A326344.
