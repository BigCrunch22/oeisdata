%N A327147 Smallest BII-number of a set-system with spanning edge-connectivity n.
%C A327147 A binary index of n is any position of a 1 in its reversed binary expansion. The binary indices of n are row n of A048793. We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. Every set-system (finite set of finite nonempty sets) has a different BII-number. For example, 18 has reversed binary expansion (0,1,0,0,1), and since the binary indices of 2 and 5 are {2} and {1,3} respectively, the BII-number of {{2},{1,3}} is 18. Elements of a set-system are sometimes called edges.
%C A327147 The spanning edge-connectivity of a set-system is the minimum number of edges that must be removed (without removing incident vertices) to obtain a set-system that is disconnected or covers fewer vertices.
