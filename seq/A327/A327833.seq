%N A327833 Number of non-overlapping pairs of adjacent runs in permutations of [n].
%C A327833 A run is a maximal consecutive subsequence of increasing values; two adjacent runs are non-overlapping if the least value in the first run exceeds the greatest value in the second.
%C A327833 Permutations all of whose adjacent runs overlap are in the image of the pop-stack sorting operation (see A307030 and references).
%F A327833 a(n) = (n-1)*n! - (n/3-1/2)*floor(e*n!) + (n/6-1/2), for all n > 1.
%F A327833 Asymptotically, the expected number of non-overlapping adjacent pairs of runs an n-permutation is (1-e/3)*n + (e/2-1).
%e A327833 a(3) = 4: one non-overlapping pair of adjacent runs in both 231 and 312, and two non-overlapping pairs in 321; the pairs of adjacent runs in 132 and 213 overlap.
