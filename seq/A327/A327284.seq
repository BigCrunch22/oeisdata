%N A327284 Indices of terms of the Hofstadter Q-sequence (A005185) not used in generating a later term.
%C A327284 Each term of the Q-sequence is the sum of two previous terms. This sequence gives the Q-sequence terms which appear never to be used as one of those two. In other words, a(n) != x - A005185(x-1), and a(n) != x - A005185(x-2).
