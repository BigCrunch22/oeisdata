%N A327166 Number of divisors d of n for which A000005(d)*d is equal to n, where A000005(x) gives the number of divisors of x.
%C A327166 a(n) tells how many times in total n occurs in A038040.

%F A327166 a(n) = Sum_{d|n} [A000005(d)*d == n], where [ ] is the Iverson bracket.
%e A327166 108 has the following twelve divisors: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 27, 36, 54, 108]. Of these, only d=18 and d=27 are such that d*A000005(d) = 108, as 18*6 = 27*4 = 108. Thus a(108) = 2.
