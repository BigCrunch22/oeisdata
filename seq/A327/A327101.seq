%N A327101 BII-numbers of 2-cut-connected set-systems (cut-connectivity >= 2).
%C A327101 A binary index of n is any position of a 1 in its reversed binary expansion. The binary indices of n are row n of A048793. We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. Every set-system (finite set of finite nonempty sets) has a different BII-number. For example, 18 has reversed binary expansion (0,1,0,0,1), and since the binary indices of 2 and 5 are {2} and {1,3} respectively, the BII-number of {{2},{1,3}} is 18. Elements of a set-system are sometimes called edges.
%C A327101 A set-system is 2-cut-connected if any single vertex can be removed (along with any empty edges) without making the set-system disconnected or empty. Except for cointersecting set-systems (A326853), this is the same as 2-vertex-connectivity.
%F A327101 If (*) is intersection and (-) is complement, we have A327101 * A326704 = A326751 - A058891, i.e., the intersection of A327101 (this sequence) with A326704 (antichains) is the complement of A058891 (singletons) in A326751 (blobs).
