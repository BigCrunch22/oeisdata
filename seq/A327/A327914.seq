%N A327914 The 58 prime dates of each non-leap year of the form concatenate(month,day) with leading zero for days 1..9.
%C A327914 All these dates come in non-leap years from the months January, February, ..., December, in the form  m.d, with a 0 in front of the days 1..9, with 7, 3, 5, 4, 4, 5, 4, 6, 4, 5, 5, 6 prime dates, respectively, adding up to 58. For the corresponding leap year case with 59 prime dates see A327915.
%C A327914 Comparing with A327914 (no leap year, no 0 in front of days d = 1..9) one finds the number differences for the months  0, -2, -1, -2+1 = -1, 0, 0, -1, -1, -1+1 = 0, -3, +1, -1+1 = 0, respectively. For a month with difference 0 (Jan, May, Jun) one just has to add a zero before the days 1..9 in A327914. In the other cases a -x indicates that x dates are no longer prime after insertion of a 0 before days 1..9, and +1 indicates that a new prime date appears: Feb: 203 and 209 out, Mar: 301 out, Apr: 403 and 407 out, 409 in, Jul: 703 out, Aug: 803 out, Sep: 907 out, 901 in, Oct  101, 103 and 107 out, Nov: 1109 in, Dec: 1207 out, 1201 in.
