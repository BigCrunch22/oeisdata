%N A327920 The 16 pure prime dates of each year of the form concatenate(day,month) with month and day also prime numbers.
%C A327920 For the case of the 16, respectively 17, pure prime dates of the form concatenate(month,day) see A327918 (non-leap years) and A327919 (leap years).
%C A327920 Only the three months m = 3, 7, and 11 qualify. The qualifying days are for November (m = 11): d = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, and for months March and July (m = 3 and 7): d = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31.
