%N A327188 For any n >= 0: consider the different ways to split the binary representation of n into two (possibly empty) parts, say with value x and y; a(n) is the greatest possible value of x AND y (where AND denotes the bitwise AND operator).
%C A327188 The first 10000 positive integers where the sequence equals zero match the first 10000 terms of A082662; is that true forever?

%e A327188 For n=42:
%e A327188 - the binary representation of 42 is "101010",
%e A327188 - there are 7 ways to split it:
%e A327188    - "" and "101010": x=0 and y=42: 0 AND 42 = 0,
%e A327188    - "1" and "01010": x=1 and y=10: 1 AND 10 = 0,
%e A327188    - "10" and "1010": x=2 and y=10: 2 AND 10 = 2,
%e A327188    - "101" and "010": x=5 and y=2: 5 AND 2 = 0,
%e A327188    - "1010" and "10": x=10 and y=2: 10 AND 2 = 2,
%e A327188    - "10101" and "0": x=21 and y=0: 21 AND 0 = 0,
%e A327188    - "101010" and "": x=42 and y=0: 42 AND 0 = 0,
%e A327188 - hence a(42) = 2.
