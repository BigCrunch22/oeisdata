%N A327830 Numbers m such that the geometric mean of tau(m) and sigma(m) is an integer.
%C A327830 The first 20 terms of this sequence are also the first 20 terms of A144695: m such that sigma(m)/tau(m) is a square. Indeed, if sigma(m)/tau(m) is a square then sigma(m)*tau(m) is also a square, but the converse is false. These counterexamples are in A327831; the first one is a(21) = 232.
%C A327830 The primes p of the form 2*k^2 - 1: 7, 17, 31, 71, ... (A066436) form a subsequence because sigma(p) * tau(p) = (2*k)^2.
%C A327830 Another subsequence consists of the terms m such that sigma(m) and tau(m) are both squares; this occurs when m is the product of two distinct primes p*q, p < q where sigma(m) = (p+1)*(q+1) is a square and tau(m) = 4. The first few terms are 22, 94, 115, 119, 214, ... They are in A256152.
%e A327830 sigma(30) = 72 and tau(30) = 8, sigma(30)*tau(30) = 576 = 24^2, hence 30 is a term.
