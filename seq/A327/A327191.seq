%F A327191 a(n) = 0 iff n = 0 or n belongs to A175468.
%e A327191 For n=42:
%e A327191 - the binary representation of 42 is "101010",
%e A327191 - there are 7 ways to split it:
%e A327191    - "" and "101010": x=0 and y=42: abs(0 - 42) = 42,
%e A327191    - "1" and "01010": x=1 and y=10: abs(1 - 10) = 9,
%e A327191    - "10" and "1010": x=2 and y=10: abs(2 - 10) = 8,
%e A327191    - "101" and "010": x=5 and y=2: abs(5 - 2) = 3,
%e A327191    - "1010" and "10": x=10 and y=2: abs(10 - 2) = 8,
