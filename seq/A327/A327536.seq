%N A327536 Number of divisors of n that are 1, prime, or whose prime indices are relatively prime.
%C A327536 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798. Numbers that are 1, prime, or whose prime indices are relatively prime are A327534. The maximum divisor of n satisfying the same conditions is A327535(n).
