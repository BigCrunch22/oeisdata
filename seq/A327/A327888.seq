%N A327888 Orders of cubic (i.e., trivalent, 3-regular) distance-regular graphs.
%C A327888 "Order" is the number of vertices. Terms are listed from smallest to largest, with duplications when there exist multiple graphs with the same order.
%H A327888 Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance-regular_graph#Cubic_distance-regular_graphs">Cubic distance-regular graphs</a>
%e A327888 4 is a term because the tetrahedron graph is cubic and distance-regular and has order 4.
%e A327888 20 is a term because the dodecahedron graph is cubic and distance-regular and has order 20.
%Y A327888 Cf. A328144 (cubic distance-transitive graphs), A075124 (cubic symmetric graphs).
