%N A327886 Digits d in decimal expansion of n replaced with d-th digit of n (keeping the digits 0). If n does not have enough digits to index, the indexing resumes at the first digit of n as many times as necessary to find the substitution digit. Leading zeros are erased unless the result is 0.
%C A327886 For all numbers n, the iterated map n -> a(n) gives a loop of numbers linked by permutations of their digits, consisting of k-cycles, with k always odd. Indeed, for k even, each iteration divides k by 2. After a few steps, we obtain a fixed point or a loop of 2, 3, 4 or 6, generated respectively by:
%C A327886 - the identity,
%C A327886 - 2 permutations consisting of one, two or three 3-cycle,
%C A327886 - 3 permutations of 7-cycle,
%C A327886 - 4 permutations of 5-cycle,
%C A327886 - 6 permutations of 9-cycle.
%C A327886 Thus, the smallest numbers n giving such loops are respectively 0, 231, 2345671, 23451 and 234567891. There is no step before loop of 6 because the permutation applies directly to all nonzero digits. Also applicable to other bases, the loop length is the least common multiple of multiplicative orders of 2 modulo the different values of k.

%e A327886 For n=23, the digit 2 is replaced by three, because it is the second digit of n. Next, the digit 3 cannot be replaced directly because n has no third digit. After counting the first two digits of n, the indexing resumes at the first digit of n which corresponds here to the third ordinal: the digit 3 is thus replaced by two. In summary: a(23) = {2nd digit of n, 1st digit of n} = {3, 2} = 32.
