%N A327332 "Concave pentagon" toothpick sequence, starting with a V-toothpick (see Comments for precise definition).
%C A327332 Another version and very similar to A327330.
%C A327332 This arises from a hybrid cellular automaton on a triangular grid formed of V-toothpicks (A161206) and I-toothpicks (A160164).
%C A327332 After 2^k stages, the structure looks like a concave pentagon, which is formed essentially by an equilateral triangle (E) surrounded by two right triangles (R1 and R2) both with their hypotenuses in vertical position, as shown below:

%C A327332 .
%C A327332 Every triangle has a slight resemblance to Sierpinsky's triangle, but here the structure is much more complex.
%C A327332 For the construction of the sequence the rules are as follows:
%C A327332 On the infinite triangular grid at stage 0 there are no toothpicks, so a(0) = 0.
%C A327332 At stage 1 we place an V-toothpick, formed of two single toothpicks, with its central vertice directed up, like a gable roof, so a(1) = 1.
%C A327332 For the next n generation we have that:
%C A327332 If n is even then at every free end of the structure we add a I-toothpick formed of two single toothpicks in vertical position.
%C A327332 If n is odd then at every free end of the structure we add a V-toothpick, formed of two single toothpicks, with its central vertex directed upward, like a gable roof (see the example).
%C A327332 a(n) gives the total number of V-toothpicks and I-toothpicks in the structure after the n-th stage.
%C A327332 A327333 (the first differences) gives the number of elements added at the n-th stage.
%C A327332 2*a(n) gives the total number of single toothpicks of length 1 after the n-th stage.
%C A327332 The structure contains many kinds of polygonal regions, for example: triangles, trapezes, parallelograms, regular hexagons, concave hexagons, concave decagons, concave 12-gons, concave 18-gons, concave 20-gons, and other polygons.
%C A327332 The structure is almost identical to the structure of A327330, but a little smaller.
%C A327332 The behavior seems to suggest that this sequence can be calculated with a formula, in the same way as A139250, but that is only a conjecture.
%C A327332 The "word" of this cellular automaton is "ab". For more information about the word of cellular automata see A296612.
%C A327332 It appears that A327330 shares infinitely many terms with this sequence.

%e A327332 After two generations there are only one V-toothpick and two I-toothpicks in the structure, so a(2) = 1 + 2 = 3 (note that in total there are 2*a(2)= 2*3 = 6 single toothpicks of length 1).
