%N A254056 Sum two last digits of the sequence to get next term, starting with 1,2.
%C A254056 Start with {1,2}: 1,2,3,5,8,13,4,7,11,2,3,5,8,13,4,7,11,2,3,5,8,13,4,7,... period  {11,2,3,5,8,13,4,7,}.
%C A254056 Sequences with any other pair of initial digits eventually merge with case {1,2} except for the case {4,5}: 4,5,9,14,5,9,14,5,9,14,... which has period {5,9,14}.
