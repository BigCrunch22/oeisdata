%N A254065 Vulgar fractions whose denominators are numbers ending with nine, the case 1/19.
%C A254065 The method provides an alternative for obtaining reversals of decimal expansions of 1/n, where n is of the form 10x + 9. We then access the reversal of the periodic sequence, noting that it matches the decimal expansion of 1/19 as shown in A021023: (.0, 5, 2, 6, 3, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 4, 7, 3, 6, 8, 4, 2, 1, ...). Page 23 of "Vedic Mathematics" states "In accordance with the sutra, we multiply it by 2" [since we have deleted the rightmost 9 and enhanced the remaining digit (a 1) by 1 = 2]. Then N. Ramamurthy states: "Similarly the multiplier for 49 is 5, for 149 is 15, for 12789 is 1279 and so on."

%F A254065 Given 1/n, where n ends in 9, delete the 9 and use the previous set of digits (incremented by 1) as a multiplier M; let the first term = 1. Perform M * 1 and carry over the remainder if any, marking down the result. Perform M * result, adding the carryover for the next operation, and continue until the sequence repeats.

%e A254065 Let 1/n = 1/19. Delete the 9 and increment the previous digit (1) by 1 to get 2, our multiplier M. Let the first term be 1, then continue multiplying by M, getting 1, 2, 4, 8, ... then the next term is 6 with a carryover of 1, giving (1, 2, 4, 8, 6, ...). The next term is 3 since 2 * 6 = 12; thus we mark down 3 (2 plus the carryover). The next term is 7 (being 2 * 3 plus the carryover of 1); proceeding in this way, we get 1, 2, 4, 8, 6, 3, 7, 4, 9, 8, 7, ...
