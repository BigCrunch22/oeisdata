%N A254001 a(n) is the least natural number k such that n^k is abundant or perfect, or a(n) is 0 if all n^k are deficient numbers.
%C A254001 Let p_1, p_2, ..., p_m be the distinct primes dividing n. If (p_1/(p_1 - 1))*(p_2/(p_2 - 1))*...*(p_m/(p_m - 1)) > 2, then sufficiently high powers of n are abundant. Otherwise all powers of n are deficient, and we set a(n)=0.
%C A254001 The sequence is unbounded. In particular, for each N, we have a(A063765(N)) = N.
