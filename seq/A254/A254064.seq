%N A254064 Positive integers whose square is expressible in exactly one way as x^2 + 6xy + y^2, with 0 < x < y.
%C A254064 Equivalently positive integers whose square is expressible in exactly one way as -x^2 + 2xy + y^2 with 0 < x < y by replacing (x,y) with (2x,x+y).  As such this sequence represents the sum of legs that are unique to a single Pythagorean triangle. - _Ray Chandler_, Feb 18 2020
%C A254064 n is in the sequence iff A331671(n)=1. - _Ray Chandler_, Feb 26 2020
