%N A254003 For n>=1, let B_n(k) be the sequence defined by b(1)=1, b(2)=p_1, ..., b(n+2)=p_(n+1), thereafter (for k>=n+3) the smallest number not occurring earlier having at least one common factor with b(k-(n+1)), but none with b(k-1)*b(k-2)*...*b(k-n); a(n) is m such that B_n(m)=6.
%C A254003 In particular, A098550(10)=6, A247225(14)=6.
%C A254003 On the other hand, it seems likely that 6 never appears in A247665 (which has a different although related definition). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 26 2015
