%N A254785 Zeroless numbers n with digits d_1, d_2, ... d_k such that F(d_1) + F(d_2) + ... + F(d_k) is a Fibonacci number where F(.) is A000045.
%C A254785 If n is a member of this sequence, any reordering of its digits is also a member of this sequence. Since A000045(0) = 0, any number is the sequence can have an arbitrary number of zeros; hence, the numbers with zeros have been omitted as trivial.
%e A254785 23 is a member of this sequence because F(2) + F(3) = 1+2 = 3 is a Fibonacci number.
