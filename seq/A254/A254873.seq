%N A254873 Recamán [divide, -, +, *]-sequence with seed 14 and step 2.
%C A254873 Starting at the seed number (14) the sequence continues by dividing, subtracting, adding or multiplying by the step number (2). Division gets precedence over subtraction which gets precedence over addition which gets precedence over multiplication. The new number must be a positive integer and not previously listed. The sequence terminates if this is impossible.
%C A254873 Less chaotic sequences are obtained if division is not included (see for example A254868).
%C A254873 These sequences were first explored by Brian Kehrig, a 15-year-old student at Renert School, Calgary, Canada.
%C A254873 They are exceptionally good sequences to introduce to the elementary school math classroom.
%C A254873 Like many Recamán sequences, this is worth listening to.
