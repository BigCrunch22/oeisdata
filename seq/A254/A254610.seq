%N A254610 Number of decompositions of 2n into sums of two primes p1 <= p2 such that the smallest |k*p1-p2| = 2^m+b, where |b|<=2.
%C A254610 a(1)=0 is the only zero term up to n=200000.
%C A254610 It is hypothesized that a(1)=0 is the only zero term of this sequence.
%C A254610 The histogram for 1<=n<=60000 of this sequence shows the shape of a distribution with mode=10, and it has a regional maximum at 20.

%e A254610 For n=1, 2n=2, which cannot be decomposed into the sum of two primes, so a(1)=0.
%e A254610 For n=2, 2n = 4 = 2+2, and 2-2 = 0 = 2^0-1, so the difference from 2^0 is 1, which satisfies the condition. So a(2)=1;
%e A254610 ...
%e A254610 For n=5, 2n = 10 = 3+7 = 5+5. |3*2-7| = 1 = 2^0 and |5-5| = 0 = 2^0-1; both satisfy the condition, so a(5)=2.
%e A254610 ...
%e A254610 For n=35, 2n = 70 = 3+67 = 11+59 = 17+53 = 23+47 = 29+41. These five Goldbach decompositions make A045917(35)=5. Among these, |3*22-67| = 1 = 2^0; |11*5-59| = 4 = 2^2; |17*3-53| = 2 = 2^1; |23*2-47| = 1 satisfies the condition. However, |29-41| = 12 = 2^3+4 = 2^4-4 does not satisfy the condition. So, a(35)=4 < A045917(35). This is the first term where the two sequences differ.
