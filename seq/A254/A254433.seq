%N A254433 Maximum number of "feasible" partitions of length n.
%C A254433 a(n) gives the highest value in the (3^(n-1)+1)/2-th through the (3^n-1)/2-th terms of the sequence A254296. It lists the highest possible number of "feasible" partitions into n parts.

%F A254433 The first term is 1. For n>=2, a(n) = A254296((3^(n-1)+5)/2).
%e A254433 The numbers 2, 3 and 4 are "feasibly" partitionable into 2 parts. Each of them has 1 feasible partitions. So a(2)=1.
%e A254433 The numbers 14 to 40 are "feasibly" partitionable into 4 parts. Among them 16, 18, 19 and 22 each has the highest 12 "feasible" partitions. So a(4)=12.
%e A254433 The numbers 122 to 364 are "feasibly" partitionable into 6 parts. Among them 124 has the highest 3950 "feasible" partitions. So a(6)=3950.
