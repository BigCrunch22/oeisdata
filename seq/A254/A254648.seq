%N A254648 Numbers n whose square representation in base 10 can be split into three parts whose sum is n.
%C A254648 Extension of the Kaprekar numbers (A006886) where the number of parts of n^2 is two. It is probably possible to generalize this property with the division of n^2 into m parts.
%C A254648 By convention, the second and third parts may start with the digit 0, but must be positive. For example, 991 is in the sequence because 991^2 = 982081, which can be split into 982, 08 and 1, and 982 + 08 + 1 = 991. But 100 is not; although 100^2 = 10000 and 100 + 0 + 0 = 100, the second and the third part here are not positive. The number 99 is not in the sequence although 99^2 = 9801 and 98 + 0 + 1 = 99.
%C A254648 Property of the sequence:
%C A254648 The sequence is infinite because the numbers of the form 10^n-9 = 91, 991, 991, ... (A170955) are in the sequence: if m = 99...91 with k digits "9", then m^2 = 99...98200...081 with k-1 digits "9" and k-1 digits "0", and 99...982 + 00...8 + 1 = 99...91 = m.
%C A254648 The prime of the sequence are {379, 9901, ...} union {A093177}.
%C A254648 Calculation method: For each class of squares having k-digit numbers, the number of partitions into 3 parts is n(n+1)/2 (A000217). For instance, if the numbers are of the form (abcde) with k = 5, the 6 partitions into 3 subsets are {a,b,{c,d,e}}, {a,{b,c},{d,e}}, {a,{b,c,d},e}, {{a,b},c,{d,e}}, {{a,b},{c,d},e}, {{a,b,c},d,e} and then we compute the corresponding numbers.
%C A254648 Example: 235^2 = 55225 (abcde) = 55225 => {a,b,{c,d,e}} = {5,5,{2,2,5}} => {5,5,225} and 5+5+225 = 235.
