%N A254432 Natural numbers with the maximum number of "feasible" partitions of length m.
%C A254432 Sequence A254296 describes "feasible" partitions and gives the number of all "feasible" partitions of all natural numbers. We must take the value of m from there.
%C A254432 Here we list the natural numbers with the highest number of "feasible" partitions of length m. Such numbers are unique for all m except for m=[2,4,5].
%C A254432 For m>=6, there is a unique natural number with the maximum number of "feasible" partitions.

%F A254432 For the first 11 values, there is no specific formula.
%F A254432 For n>=12, a(n) = (3^(m-7)+5)/2.
%F A254432 Recursively, for n>=13, a(n) = 3*a(n-1)-5.
%e A254432 Natural numbers with maximum "feasible" partitions are unique for all m except for m=[2,4,5].
%e A254432 For m=1, the number 1 has 1 "feasible" partition.
%e A254432 For m=2, three numbers 2,3 and 4 each has the highest 1 "feasible" partition.
