%N A269346 Perfect cubes that are not the difference of two primes.
%C A269346 An even number can be the difference of two primes, but an odd one can only be if an odd number m is such that m+2 is prime. Since a(n) is odd and such that a(n)+2 is composite, a(n) cannot be such a difference.
%C A269346 The cubes of this property are also the cubes in A269345.
%C A269346 It is still an open conjecture that every even number is the difference of 2 primes. On the other hand, a computer test shows that all even cubes <= 10^21 can be written as the difference of 2 primes. The computer program generating the sequence needs an additional part to test for even cubes besides checking that for odd m^3, m^3+2 is composite. - _Chai Wah Wu_, Mar 03 2016

%e A269346 For n=1, 343 = 7^3 and 345 = 343+2 is a composite, so 343 is a term.
