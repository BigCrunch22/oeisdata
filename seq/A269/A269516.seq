%N A269516 Number of T(n) X T(n) matrices containing the multiset {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, ..., n, n, ..., n} in each row and column, where T(n) = A000217(n).
%C A269516 Each 1 <= k <= n appears k times in the multiset. Terms include rotations/reflections. Related to Latin squares. Inspired by related question in "Chess Set Latin Square" link.

%e A269516 Using terminology such as that suggested by Rebecca J. Stones in a "Chess Set Latin Square" comment, this matrix is a (3, 2, 1)-frequency square corresponding to a decomposition of K_{6,6} into one 3-regular spanning subgraph, one 2-regular spanning subgraph, and one 1-regular spanning subgraph.
