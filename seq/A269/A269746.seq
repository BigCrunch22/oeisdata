%N A269746 Maximal number of 1's in an equilateral triangle of 0's and 1's with n points on each side, the entries being constant on vertical lines, with property that no three 1's form a triangle with sides parallel to the edges of the triangle.
%C A269746 The triangle is oriented with apex at the top and horizontal base.
%C A269746 Label the entries in the top left and right edges with the numbers 1 through 2n-1, and let S denote the subset of [1..2n-1] where these edges contains 1's. Then the matrix has the no-subtriangle property iff S contains no three-term arithmetic progression.

%e A269746 It is a plausible conjecture that any optimal solution S here is also an optimal solution to the square grid version in A269745, and vice versa. (The square grid being obtained by reflecting the triangle in its base.)
%Y A269746 This is a lower bound on A227308.
