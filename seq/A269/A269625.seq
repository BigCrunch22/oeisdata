%N A269625 a(1)=1; a(2)=0. For n>=3 , if {d(1),...,d(r)} is a part of {a(1),...,a(n-1)} then a(n)=1 else a(n)=0. d(j) digits of the binary representation of n.
%e A269625 a(1)=1; a(2)=0.
%e A269625 n=3, binary 11. {1,1} is not a part of {1,0} thus a(3)=0.
%e A269625 n=4, binary 100. {1,0,0} is a part of {1,0,0} thus a(4)=1.
%e A269625 n=5, binary 101. {1,0,1} is not a part of {1,0,0,1} thus a(5)=0.
%e A269625 n=6, binary 110. {1,1,0} is not a part of {1,0,0,1,0} thus a(6)=0.
%e A269625 n=7, binary 111. {1,1,1} is not a part of {1,0,0,1,0,0} thus a(7)=0.
