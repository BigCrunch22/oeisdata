%N A269326 Let k be a number which is simultaneously SierpiÅ„ski and Riesel, and let P be a set of primes which cover every number of the form k*2^m + 1 and of the form k*2^m - 1 with m >= 1. Sequence shows elements of the set P which has the property that the product of its primes is as small as it is possible.
