%N A269757 Number of black cells after n moves of Langton's ant on an infinite hexagonal grid, starting with only white cells.
%C A269757 On a white cell, turn 60 degrees right, flip the color of the cell, then move forward one unit. On a black cell, turn 60 degrees left, flip the color of the cell, then move forward one unit.
%C A269757 One may see the ant as (1) living on a hexagonal tiling (as in the illustration), in which case one third of all tiles are never visited, or (2) as living on a triangular tiling, in which case these never-visited hexagonal tiles are divided between six neighboring tiles to form triangular tiles, or (3) as living on a hexagonal grid understood as a graph dual to that triangular tiling, in which case the ant travels from one vertex to another using edges. - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Oct 09 2016
