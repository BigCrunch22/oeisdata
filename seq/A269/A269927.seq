%N A269927 Start with A_0 = 0, then extend by setting B_k = complement of A_k and A_{k+1} = A_k C_1 C_2 ... C_m, where m is the length of A_k and C_i = A_k if the i-th element of A_k is 1 and C_i = B_k otherwise; sequence is limit of A_k as k -> infinity.
%C A269927 Similar to the Thue-Morse sequence, with the replication rule determined by the bits in A_k at each step.
%C A269927 The lengths of A_i's are 1, 2, 6, 42, 1806,... (A007018).
