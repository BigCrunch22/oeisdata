%N A269230 Indices for which A037053(n), the smallest prime with n digits '0', does not have n consecutive digits '0'.
%C A269230 Sequence A085824 lists the indices n for which A037053(n) has only two nonzereo digits, i.e., A037053(n) = a*10^(n+1) + b, with 1 <= a,b <= 9.
%C A269230 It is conjectured that, apart from A037053(0) = 2, all other terms have three nonzero digits and are therefore of the form A037053(n) = a*10^(n+2) + b*10^k + c, where 1 <= a,b,c <= 9 and 1 <= k <= n+1.
%C A269230 Whenever 1 < k < n+1, the n digits '0' are not consecutive but separated in two "chunks" of length n-k+1 and k-1, respectively. These indices n are listed here.
%C A269230 I conjecture that k < n+1 for all n (where k is function of n, of course).
%C A269230 For most indices n listed here, the smallest prime with n consecutive digits '0' is of the above form with k = n+1, i.e., of the form ab0...0c = (10a+b)*10^(n+1) + c.
%C A269230 The first index n for which this is not the case remains to be found. It can be expected that for this index n, the least prime with n consecutive digits '0' is either of the form a0...0b0c = a*10^(n+3) + b*100 + c (in which case it equals A037053(n+1)) or of the form a0...0bc with a > 9 (in which case it equals A037053(n+1) if a = 0 (mod 10)).
%C A269230 Sequence A269260 lists the values a > 9 such that the least prime with (at least) n consecutive '0's equals nextprime(a*10^(n+1)), for the numbers n listed here. - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 22 2016
%C A269230 The first two values of n that do not satisfy the above forms are 192 and 213. The least prime with 192 consecutive 0's is 11100...0007. The least prime with 213 consecutive 0's is 100...000499. - _Chai Wah Wu_, Mar 11 2018
