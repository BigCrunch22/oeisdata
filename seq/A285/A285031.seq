%N A285031 0-limiting word of the morphism 0->10, 1-> 001.
%C A285031 The morphism 0->10, 1->001 has two limiting words.  If the number of iterations is even, the 0-word evolves from 0 -> 10 -> 00110 -> 101000100110 -> 00110001101010001101000100110; if the number of iterations is odd, the 1-word evolves from 0 -> 10 -> 00110 -> 101000100110, as in A285034.
