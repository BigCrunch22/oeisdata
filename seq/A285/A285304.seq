%N A285304 P-positions in the sum-from-product game.
%C A285304 The sum-from-product game is played by two players alternating moves. Given a positive integer n, a player can choose any two integers a and b, such that ab = n. The player subtracts a + b from n, given that the result is nonnegative. That is, the next player starts with a new number n - a - b. A player without a move loses.
%C A285304 Prime numbers are P-positions.
%C A285304 N-positions are A285847.
