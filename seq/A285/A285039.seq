%N A285039 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct terms such that, for any n>0, a(n) is divisible by k and a(n+1) is divisible by prime(k) for some k.
%C A285039 As prime(1)=2, this sequence can always be extended with an even number.
%C A285039 This sequence is a permutation of the natural numbers, with inverse A285041 (say prime(k) divides n: the sequence contains all the multiples of 2*k, hence n will eventually be chosen).
%C A285039 This sequence has a fractal structure that is highlighted in the illustrations of some derived sequences in the Links section.
