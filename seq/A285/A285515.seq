%N A285515 {00->0, 11->1}-transform of A285501.
%C A285515 As a word, A285501 = 0011001100110011111100110011111100110011..., so that the transform of A285501 that results from the substitutions 00-> and 11->1 is 01010101110101110101010101011101011101010...  The sequence is also the 0-limiting word of the morphism 0->11, 1->0101.  See A285517 and A285518 for conjectured connections to the golden ratio.
