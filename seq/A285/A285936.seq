%N A285936 Number of rotations of the digits in n produced by n * x/y where x != y.
%C A285936 Rotations with a leading digit of zero are omitted.
%C A285936 If d is the number of nonzero digits in n, a(n) < d.

%e A285936 a(13) = 0 because there is no fraction x/y such that 13 * x/y = 31, the only rotation of 13;
%e A285936 a(15) = 1 because 15 * 17/5 = 51, the only rotation 51;
%e A285936 a(114) = 2 because 114 * 47/38 = 141 and 114 * 137/38 = 411, both the rotations of 114.
