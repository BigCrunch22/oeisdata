%N A285527 Number of super perfect rhythmic tilings of [0,3n-1] with triples.
%C A285527 A super perfect tiling of the line with triples consists of n groups of three evenly spaced points, each group having a different common interval such that all points of the line are covered, and such that all intervals are inferior or equal to n (thus, each interval belongs to [1..n]).
%F A285527 For n>1, a(n) = A059108(n)*2 because A059108 ignores reflected solutions. - _Fausto A. C. Cariboni_, May 20 2017
%e A285527 For n = 9, there are 18 tilings.
%e A285527 One is: (0,2,4), (1,5,9), (3,11,19), (6,12,18), (7,14,21), (8,17,26), (10,13,16), (15,20,25), (22,23,24), with the intervals: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 appearing in order: 2,4,8,6,7,9,3,5,1.
