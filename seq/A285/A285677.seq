%N A285677 {0010->2}-transform of the infinite Fibonacci word A003849.
%C A285677 As a word, A003849 = 01001010010010100..., and replacing each 0010 by 2 gives 0121201012120101201012120101212010...
%C A285677 Warning: "replacing each 0010 by 2" means "replacing each 0010 by 2 from left to right, consecutively". The result is that the word a(8)...a(14)=0010010 in A003849 is replaced by 201, not by 22. - _Michel Dekking_, Aug 27 2018
