%N A285249 0-limiting word of the morphism 0->10, 1-> 0101.
%C A285249 The morphism 0->10, 1-> 0101 has two limiting words.  If the number of iterations is even, the 0-word evolves from 0 -> 10 -> 0101 -> 100101100101 -> 010110100101100101010110100101100101; if the number of iterations is odd, the 1-word evolves from 0 -> 10 -> 0101 -> 100101100101, as in A285252.
