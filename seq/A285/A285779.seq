%N A285779 Parity index: number of integers z with 1 <= z <= n for which A010060(z) = A010060(n), negated if A010060(n) = 1.
%C A285779 Signs are given by A010059 or A010060, the Thue-Morse sequence. Here, zero has positive sign. Like A130472, this sequence maps the natural numbers to the integers. Positive terms are one less than the corresponding term in A008619.
%C A285779 This was a test problem for seqr, a genetic programming integer sequence recognizer, which discovered a method for generating terms of the sequence given the bits of n in descending order.
%C A285779 Iterating over the bits of n in ascending order yields a sequence with more irregular behavior, differing in absolute value by up to 2: 0, -1, -2, 0, -3, +3, +3, +2, -5, 5, 5, ...
%C A285779 Consecutive terms of A285779 usually differ in absolute value by 1 or 2, but consecutive terms differing only in sign occur irregularly. This happens first for a(11) = -6 and a(12) = +6.
