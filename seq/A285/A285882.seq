%N A285882 Numbers which are twice a U(2,4) number but not the sum of two distinct U(2,4) numbers.
%C A285882 The sequence could also be described as numbers that have no representation as a sum of two distinct U(2,4) numbers, but have a "pseudo-representation" u + u, where u is in U(2,4).
%C A285882 a(10), if it exists, is larger than 10^8. - _Giovanni Resta_, May 02 2017
%e A285882 188 is in the sequence since it can't be written as the sum of two distinct U(2,4) numbers A048951, but 188 = 94 + 94, where 94 is in U(2,4).
%Y A285882 Cf. A048951.
