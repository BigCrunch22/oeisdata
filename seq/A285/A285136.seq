%N A285136 1-limiting word of the morphism 0->10, 1-> 0001.
%C A285136 The morphism 0->10, 1->0001 has two limiting words.  If the number of iterations is even, the 0-word evolves from 0 -> 10 -> 000110 -> 1010100001000110 -> 00011000011000011010101000011010100001000110; if the number of iterations is odd, the 1-word evolves from 0 -> 10 -> 000110 -> 1010100001000110, as in A285136.
