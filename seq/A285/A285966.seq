%C A285966 From _Michel Dekking_, Mar 15 2019: (Start)
%C A285966 This sequence is a morphic sequence, i.e., a letter-to-letter image of a fixed point of a morphism. Coding:
%C A285966       0 followed by 0 by 0,
%C A285966       0 followed by 1 by 2,
%C A285966       1 by 1 if 1 was in 010 in the TM word,
%C A285966       1 by 3 if it was the image of 11 in the TM word.
%C A285966 It then follows that (a(n)) is the letter to letter image 0->0, 1->1, 2->0, 3->1 of the unique fixed point of the morphism
%C A285966       0 -> 21
%C A285966       1 -> 0
%C A285966       2 -> 23
%C A285966       3 -> 210.
%C A285966 Explanation of (the more difficult) first and last productions:
%C A285966   010 -> 011001 by the TM morphism, which is coded to 2302. Here the 3 is put in the production 2 -> 23, the 0 is from the production 1 -> 0, and the final 2 is taken care of in either the production 0 -> 21, or the production 2 -> 23. For the last production, note that 0110 -> 01101001 by the TM morphism, which is coded to 232102. Here the prefix 23 is taken care of by the production 2 -> 23, then 11 coded by 3 gives 210, and the final 2 comes from the final 0 in 0110.
