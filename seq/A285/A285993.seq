%N A285993 Largest odd abundant number (A005231) equal to the product of n consecutive primes.
%C A285993 The smallest term is a(5) = 3*5*7*11*13, there is no odd abundant number (A005231) equal to the product of less than 5 consecutive primes.
%C A285993 The smallest odd abundant number (A005231) equal to the product of n consecutive primes is equal (when it exists, i.e., for n >= 5) to the least odd number with n (distinct) prime divisors, equal to the product of the first n odd primes = A070826(n+1) = A002110(n+1)/2.
%C A285993 See A188342 = (945, 3465, 15015, 692835, 22309287, ...) for the least odd primitive abundant number (A006038) with n distinct prime factors, and A275449 for the least odd primitive abundant number with n prime factors counted with multiplicity.
%C A285993 The terms are in general not primitive abundant numbers (A091191), in particular this cannot be the case when a(n) is a multiple of a(n-1), as is the case for most of the terms, for which a(n) = a(n-1)*A117366(a(n-1)). In the other event, spf(a(n)) = nextprime(spf(a(n-1))), and a(n) is in A007741(2,3,4...). These are exactly the primitive terms in this sequence.

%F A285993 a(n) >= a(n-1)*p where p = A117366(a(n-1)) = A151800(A006530(a(n-1))) = nextprime(gpf(a(n-1))), an odd abundant number equal to the product of n consecutive primes. We have strict inequality for n = 9, 18, 31, 46, 67, ..., in which case a(n) = a(n-1)*p*p'/q, where p' = nextprime(p), q = least prime factor of a(n-1). This is the case if a(n) is in A007741.
%e A285993 For n < 5, there is no odd abundant number equal to the product of n distinct primes.
%e A285993 For 5 <= n <= 8, the largest odd abundant number equal to the product of n consecutive primes is 3*...*prime(n+1).
%e A285993 For 9 <= n <= 17, the largest odd abundant number equal to the product of n consecutive primes is 5*...*prime(n+2).
%e A285993 For 18 <= n <= 30, the largest odd abundant number equal to the product of n consecutive primes is 7*...*prime(n+3).
%e A285993 For 31 <= n <= 45, the largest odd abundant number equal to the product of n consecutive primes is 11*...*prime(n+4).
%e A285993 For 46 <= n <= 66, the largest odd abundant number equal to the product of n consecutive primes is 13*...*prime(n+5).
