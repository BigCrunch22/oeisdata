%N A285142 1-limiting word of the morphism 0->10, 1->0010.
%C A285142 The morphism 0->10, 1->0010 has two limiting words.  If the number of iterations is even, the 0-word evolves from 0 -> 10 -> 001010 -> 1010001010001010 -> 00101000101010100010100010101010001010001010, as in A285139; if the number of iterations is odd, the 1-word evolves from 0 -> 10 -> 001010 -> 1010001010001010 (here).
