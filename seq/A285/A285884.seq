%N A285884 For n => 1, the number of distinct summands u and v that can be used in the representation of n as u+v, where u and v are two (possibly equal) Ulam numbers A002858.
%C A285884 An odd number in the sequence means that there exists the "pseudo-representation" u + u, where u is an Ulam number. For example, a(22)=5 since 22 = 18 + 4 = 16 + 6 = 11 + 11, and the 5 distinct summands 18,4,16,6,11 are Ulam numbers.
%C A285884 Note that both 2 and 3 are values for Ulam numbers since, by the previous comment, a value of 3 means that the Ulam number has the additional "pseudo-representation" u + u (see the Examples).
%C A285884 It seems that all nonnegative integers occur as values of this sequence.

%e A285884 a(23) = 0 since 23 can't be written as the sum of two distinct Ulam numbers. This type of numbers are in A033629.
%e A285884 a(94) = 1 since 94 = 47 + 47, where 47 is an Ulam number.  This type of numbers are in A287611.
%e A285884 a(11) = 2 since 11 has the unique representation 11 = 8 + 3, where 8,3 are Ulam numbers. If such n is also an Ulam number (such as 11), then it is in A002858.
%e A285884 a(8) = 3 since it has the representation 8 = 6 + 2 and also the additional "pseudo-representation" 8 = 4 + 4, where 6, 2, and 4 are Ulam numbers. If n has such a "pseudo-representation" and is an Ulam number, then it is in A068799.
