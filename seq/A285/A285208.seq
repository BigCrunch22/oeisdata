%N A285208 1-limiting word of the morphism 0->10, 1-> 0100.
%C A285208 The morphism 0->10, 1-> 0100 has two limiting words.  If the number of iterations is even, the 0-word evolves from 0 -> 10 -> 0100 -> 1001001010 -> 0100101001001010010010010010; if the number of iterations is odd, the 1-word evolves from 0 -> 10 -> 0100 -> 1001001010, as in A285208.
