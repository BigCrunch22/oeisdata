%N A285248 All positive integers n which for some k can be computed by a straight line program (SLP) of length k but not by a monotone straight line program (mSLP) of length k.
%C A285248 Or equivalently, all positive integers n which for some k can be computed by a non-monotone arithmetic circuit with initial input 1 with k nodes but not by a monotone arithmetic circuit with initial input 1 with k nodes.
%C A285248 In other words, all the integers which can be computed faster through the use of subtraction.
