%N A285347 Positions of 1 in A285345; complement of A285346.
%C A285347 Conjecture: 2n - 1 - a(n) is in {0,1} for n >= 1.
%C A285347 From _Michel Dekking_, Sep 14 2019: (Start)
%C A285347 Proof of the conjecture by Kimberling. I will show that
%C A285347 (*)    2n - 1 - a(n) = A189668(n) for n > 0,
%C A285347 where A189668 is the fixed point of the morphism delta given by
%C A285347     delta(0)= 010, delta(1) = 100.
%C A285347 First we have to find the sequence d(n) := a(n+1)-a(n) of first differences of a(n). We rather consider the mirror image of the morphism: 0 -> 10, 1 -> 1100, given by sigma: 0 -> 0011, 1 -> 01. Then, of course, A285345 is the binary complement (mirror image) of the fixed point xS = 0011001101010011... of sigma. So (a(n)) gives the positions of 0 in xS.
%C A285347 Let u=0, v=01, and w=011 be the return words of 0 in the sequence xS. [See Justin & Vuillon (2000) for definition of return word. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 23 2019]
%C A285347 Then
%C A285347     sigma(u) = uw, sigma(v) = uwv, sigma(w) = uwvv.
%C A285347 Coding the return words by their lengths, this gives a morphism alpha with
%C A285347     alpha(1)=13, alpha(2) = 132, alpha(3) = 1322.
%C A285347 What we found is that the difference sequence (d(n)) is equal to the fixed point xA = 131322131322132... = A326420 of the morphism alpha.
%C A285347 Note that it is shown in the comments of A326420 that xA = xB, where xB is the fixed point of the morphism beta given by
%C A285347     beta(1)=131, beta(2) = 132, beta(3) = 322.
%C A285347 To prove (*), we note that it suffices to prove the corresponding relation for the difference sequence, as 1-a(n) = 0 = A189668(1).
%C A285347 What has to be shown then is
%C A285347 (**)  d(n) = a(n+1)-a(n) = 2 - delta(n+1) + delta(n) for n>0.
%C A285347 To obtain the difference sequence (delta(n+1) - delta(n)), we consider the two-block morphism delta-hat_2 generated by delta.  The blocks of length two occurring in A189668, the fixed point of the morphism delta, are 00, 01 and 10. One finds
%C A285347     delta-hat_2(00) = 01,10,00,
%C A285347     delta-hat_2(01) = 01,10,01,
%C A285347     delta-hat_2(10) = 10,00,00.
%C A285347 This morphism is in 1 to 1 correspondence with the morphism gamma on the alphabet {-1,0,1} which has (delta(n+1)-delta(n)) as fixed point. One has
%C A285347     gamma(0) = 1,-1,0,   gamma(1) = 1,-1,1,  gamma(-1) = -1,0,0.
%C A285347 Since the map x->2-x maps the alphabet {-1,0,1} to {3,2,1}, we see that the sequence (2-delta(n+1)+delta(n)) is nothing else than the fixed point of beta. This proves (**).
