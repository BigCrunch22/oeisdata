%N A285519 Positions of 0 in A285518; complement of A285520.
%C A285519 Conjecture: a(n)/n -> (3+sqrt(5))/2.
%C A285519 From _Michel Dekking_, Feb 22 2021: (Start)
%C A285519 Here is a proof of this conjecture. The limit of a(n)/n as n tends to infinity is equal to the inverse 1/f0 of the frequency f0 of the letter 0 in the sequence (a(n)) (see also the argument in A285401).
%C A285519 From the Perron-Frobenius theorem we know that the frequency vector (f0,f1) is the normalized eigenvector associated to the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue lambda of the incidence matrix M of the generating morphism 0->11, 1->0101.
%C A285519 Here M = | 0 2|
%C A285519          | 2 2|.
%C A285519 The Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue of M is lambda = 1+sqrt(5), and the vector [u,v]:= [2, 1+sqrt(5)] is an eigenvector with lambda. So
%C A285519        1/f0 = (u+v)/u = (3+sqrt(5))/2 = phi^2, where phi = (1+sqrt(5))/2.
