%C A285726 Consider the binary tree illustrated in A005940: If we start from any n, computing successive iterations of A252463 until 1 is reached (i.e., we are traversing level by level towards the root of the tree, starting from that vertex of the tree where n is located), then a(n) gives the number of even numbers > 2 encountered on the path after the initial n, that is, both the penultimate 2 and also the starting n (if it was even) are excluded from the count.
