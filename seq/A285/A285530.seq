%N A285530 0-limiting word of the morphism 0->11, 1-> 0100.
%C A285530 The morphism 0->11, 1-> 0100 has two limiting words.  If the number of iterations is even, the 0-word evolves from 0 -> 11 -> 01000100 -> 11010011111101001111 -> 01000100110100111101000100010001000100010011010011110100010001000100...; if the number of iterations is odd, the 1-word evolves from 0 -> 11 -> 01000100 -> 11010011111101001111, as in A285533.
