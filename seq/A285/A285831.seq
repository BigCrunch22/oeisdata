%N A285831 Triangular array: row n shows the n+1 zero-one subwords of length n that occur in the infinite Fibonacci word A003849, in lexicographic order.
%C A285831 Exactly n+1 zero-one-words of length n occur as subwords of the infinite Fibonacci word w = A003849 = 01001010010010100101... For n = 0..5, they are listed here in lexicographic order. (See A285830 for a listing in order of appearance in w.)
