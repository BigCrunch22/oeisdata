%N A285518 {00->0, 11->1}-transform of A285504.
%C A285518 As a word, A285504 = 1111001100111111001100111111001100111111..., so that the substitutions 00-> and 11->1 leave 110101110101110101110101010101011101...
%C A285518 The sequence can also be given as the 1-limiting word of the morphism 0->11, 1->0101. The reason is that the generating morphism for A285504 is the morphism 0->11, 1-> 0011, which generates a 2-block morphism 00->11 11, 11->00 11 00 11. - _Michel Dekking_, Feb 28 2021
%C A285518 See A285519 and A285520 for conjectured connections to the golden ratio.
