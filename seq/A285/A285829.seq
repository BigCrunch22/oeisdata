%N A285829 Numbers n such that, for any i and j with i >= j >= 0, ds^i(n) divides ds^j(n) (where ds^k denotes the k-th iteration of the digital sum).
%C A285829 All terms are Niven numbers (A005349).
%C A285829 All terms belongs to A234474; the first difference occurs at index 81: a(81) = 312 whereas A234474(81) = 308.
%C A285829 All powers of 10 belong to the sequence, hence the sequence is infinite.

%e A285829 The digital sum of 312 is 6, and it divides 312; the digital sum of 6 is 6; hence 312 appears in the sequence.
%e A285829 The digital sum of 308 is 11, which divides 308; however the digital sum of 11 is 2, which does not divide 11; hence 308 is not in the sequence.
