%N A285128 1-limiting word of the morphism 0->10, 1-> 0000.
%C A285128 The morphism 0->10, 1->0000 has two limiting words.  If the number of iterations is even, the 0-word evolves from 0 -> 10 -> 000010 -> 10101010000010 -> 00001000001000001000001010101010000010; if the number of iterations is odd, the 1-word evolves from 0 -> 10 -> 000010 -> 10101010000010, as in A285128.
