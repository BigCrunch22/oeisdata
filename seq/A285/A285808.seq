%N A285808 a(n) = smallest k such that (6*k-3)*2^n-1 is prime.
%C A285808 As N increases, (Sum_{n=1..N} a(n)) / (Sum_{n=1..N} n) tends to log(2)/3 as seen by plotting data; this is consistent with the prime number theorem as the probability that (6*x-3)*2^n - 1 is prime is ~ 3/(n*log(2)) if n is great enough, so after n*log(2)/3 try n*log(2)/3*(3/n*log(2))=1.
%C A285808 For n=1 to 14000, a(n)/n is always < 3.
