%N A285847 N-positions in the sum-from-product game.
%C A285847 The sum-from-product game is played by two players alternating moves. Given a positive integer n, a player can choose any two integers a and b, such that ab=n. The player subtracts a+b from n, given that the result is positive. That is, the next player starts with a new number n-a-b. A player without a move loses.
%C A285847 Prime numbers are P-positions.
%C A285847 P-positions are A285304.

%e A285847 Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 11 are P-positions as there are no legal moves. Therefore, 6 and 8 are N-positions, as the only move from 6 goes to 1, and the only move from 8 goes to 2. It follows that 16 is a P-position as there are two moves: 16-4-4 = 8, and 16-2-8 = 6: both are N-positions.
%Y A285847 Cf. A285304.
