%e A285038 5 = prime(3); as 5 is coprime to 3, a(5) must be a multiple of 3; 5*3 = prime(3)*prime(2) does not belong to A120383 as it is not divisible by 2; so a(5) must also be divisible by 2; 5*3*2 belongs to A120383, hence a(5) = 3*2 = 6.
%e A285038 7 = prime(4); as 7 is coprime to 4, a(7) must be a multiple of 4; 7*4 belongs to A120383, hence a(7)=4.
