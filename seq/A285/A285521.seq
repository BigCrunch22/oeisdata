%N A285521 Table read by rows: the n-th row gives the lexicographically earliest sequence of length n such that the convex hull of (1, a(1)), ..., (n, a(n)) is an n-gon with minimum height.
%C A285521 "Minimum height" means that there is no other sequence such that the convex hull is an n-gon and max(a'(1),...,a'(n)) - min(a'(1),...,a'(n)) is smaller.
%C A285521 Each number appears at most twice in any given row.
%C A285521 Conjecture: Even-length rows have rotational symmetry.
%C A285521 Conjecture: The maximum value in any even-length row is the same as the maximum value in the preceding row.
%C A285521 Conjecture by Peter Kagey: 24th row is 12, 14, 8, 17, 5, 4, 21, 22, 2, 23, 1, 1, 24, 24, 2, 23, 3, 4, 21, 20, 8, 17, 11, 13. - _Lars Blomberg_, May 06 2017
