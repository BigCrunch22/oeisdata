%N A285565 0-limiting word of the morphism 0->11, 1-> 0110.
%C A285565 The morphism 0->11, 1-> 0110 has two limiting words.  If the number of iterations is even, the 0-word evolves from 0 -> 11 -> 01100110; if the number of iterations is odd, the 1-word evolves from 0 -> 11 -> 01100110 -> 110110011011110110011011, as in A285568.  See A285567 for a connection to the golden ratio.
