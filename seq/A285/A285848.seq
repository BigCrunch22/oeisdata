%N A285848 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms such that for any n>0, i > j >=0, gcd(a^i(n), a^j(n)) = 1 (where a^k denotes the k-th iteration of a).
%C A285848 For any n>0, n and a(n) are coprime.
%C A285848 There is only one fixed point: a(1) = 1.
%C A285848 All terms are odd.
%C A285848 All terms > 1 have an even ancestor (if n > 1 then a(n) = a^i(2*j) for some i >= 0 and j > 0).
%C A285848 If n > 1, then a(n) > n.
%C A285848 This can be proved by induction, by considering u(n) = least odd term not seen among {a(1), ..., a(n-1)}, and noticing also that u(2*n) > 2*n.
%C A285848 The derived sequence b=(a+1)/2 is a permutation of the natural numbers.
%C A285848 The first terms of the orbit of 2 are: 2, 3, 5, 11, 23, 47, 97, 197, 401, 809, 1627, 3259, 61*107, 13063, 7*3733, 13*4021, 19*5503, 163*1283, 29*14423, 83*10079, 929*1801.
%C A285848 Conjecturally, a(n) ~ 2*n.
