%N A285949 {0->01, 1->0}-transform of the Thue-Morse word A010060.
%C A285949 The morphism {0->01, 1->0} has the infinite Fibonacci word A003849 as fixed point.
%C A285949 From _Michel Dekking_, Sep 04 2020: (Start)
%C A285949 This sequence is a morphic sequence, i.e., the letter-to-letter image of the fixed point of a morphism mu.
%C A285949 The transform map 0->01, 1->0 is called a decoration in my paper "Morphic words, Beatty sequences and integer images of the Fibonacci language". It is well-known that decorated fixed points are morphic sequences, and the 'natural' algorithm to achieve this yields a morphism on an alphabet of 2+1 = 3 symbols.  So here one can take the alphabet {1,2,3}, and one obtains the morphism
%C A285949       mu:  1->12, 2->3, 3->312,
%C A285949 and the letter-to-letter map lambda defined by
%C A285949       lambda:  1->0, 2->1, 3->0.
%C A285949 Then (a(n)) = lambda(x), where x = 1,2,3,3,1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3... is the unique fixed point of the morphism mu.
%C A285949 This representation of (a(n)) leads to new derivations of the sequences  A285950 and A285951 of positions of 0, respectively 1 in (a(n)). The sequence x is a concatenation of the three return words  a=1233, b=123, and  c=12, of 1 in x. (These are all the words occurring in x starting with 1, and having no other occurrences of 1 in them).
%C A285949 Since  mu(1233) = 1233 123 12, mu(123)= 1233 12, mu(12) = 123,
%C A285949 the return words induce a derived morphism
%C A285949       tau:  a->abc, b->ac, c->b.
%C A285949 One recognizes tau as the famous Istrail morphism, which has the ternary Thue Morse  sequence A036577 = abcacbabc....  as unique fixed point.
%C A285949 A close look at the occurrences of the letters 1 and 3 (which are the two letters that are mapped to 0 by lambda) in the words a, b and c, shows that the sequence of first differences of A285950 is the decoration a->211, b->21, c->2 of the ternary Thue Morse sequence. The result is the Thue Morse sequence again, but on the alphabet {2,1}. See the comments of A285950, or Example 8 in my paper "The spectrum of dynamical systems...".
%C A285949 The letter 2 in x, which is the sole letter with lambda image 1, occurs with differences 2, 3 and 4 associated to the return words c, b and a.
%C A285949 This implies that the sequence of first differences of A285951, the positions of 1 in (a(n)), is nothing else but the ternary Thue Morse sequence with a=4, b=3 and c=2. Thus one obtains the result in my comments on A285951 in a simple way.
