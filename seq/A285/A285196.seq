%N A285196 If A_k denotes the first 2*3^k terms, then A_0 = 01, A_{k+1} = A_k A_k B_k, where B_k is the reversal of A_k.
%C A285196 The old (incorrect) definition was "If A_k denotes the first 2*3^k terms, then A_0 = 01, A_{k+1} = A_k A_k B_k, where B_k is obtained from A_k by interchanging 0's and 1's."
