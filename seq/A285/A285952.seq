%N A285952 {0->1, 1->10}-transform of the Thue-Morse word A010060.
%C A285952 The morphism {0->1, 1->10} has the infinite Fibonacci word A005614 as fixed point.
%C A285952 Since the Thue-Morse word is a concatenation of the 2-blocks 01 and 10, this word is a concatenation of 3-blocks 110 and 101. In particular the frequency of 0 is 1/3. This also follows from the fact that this sequence is a morphic sequence, i.e., the letter-to-letter image of the fixed point of a morphism. The morphism on {1,2,3} can be chosen as 1->123, 2->23, 3->1, and the letter-to-letter map as 1->1, 2->1, 3->0. - _Michel Dekking_, Sep 20 2020
%C A285952 Actually this sequence is an automatic sequence. It follows directly from the observations above that (a(n)) is the decoration by the map 0->110, 1->101 of the Thue-Morse word A010060. - _Michel Dekking_, Jun 18 2022
%e A285952 As a word, A010060 = 0110100110010110100101100..., and replacing each 0 by 1 and each 1 by 10 gives 110101101110101110110101...
