%N A279070 Compact numbers: numbers that can be expressed more compactly using their prime factorization than their decimal expansion.
%C A279070 For any number k > 1, write its "compact prime factorization", with no spaces, as p1^e1*p2^e2*...*pj^ej, where p1, p2, ..., pj are the distinct prime factors of k and e1, e2, ..., ej are their respective exponents, but omit each exponent whose value is 1 (along with its caret character "^"). Sequence gives those numbers k whose compact prime factorization has fewer characters than k has decimal digits.
%C A279070 The smallest term other than a prime power is 109375 = 5^6*7.
%C A279070 The smallest term that is a power of 10 is 10000000 = 2^7*5^7.
%C A279070 The smallest term that is a factorial is 45!

%C A279070 Includes 2^k for k >= 14, 3^k for k >= 7, 5^k for k >= 5, 7^k for k >= 4. - _Robert Israel_, Dec 26 2016
%C A279070 Let k'(b) be the smallest k such that b^k is included; then the sequence k'(2), k'(3), k'(4), ... begins {14, 7, 7, 5, 9, 4, 5, 4, 7, 4, 8, 4, 7, 6, 4, 4, 7, 4, 7, 6, 6, 3, 6, 3, ...} (with the larger values generally occurring where b has more than one prime divisor). It appears that b^k is included for all b > 1 and all k >= k'(b) with only two exceptions: although 6^k'(6) = 6^9 = 10077696 = 2^9*3^9 and 6^12 = 2176782336 = 2^12*3^12 are included, 6^10 = 60466176 = 2^10*3^10 and 6^11 = 362797056 = 2^11*3^11 are not. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Dec 26 2016

%e A279070 The number 2187 = 3^7 can be written more compactly as "3^7" (3 characters) than as "2187" (4 characters), so 2187 is in the sequence.
