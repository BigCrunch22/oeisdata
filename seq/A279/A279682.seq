%N A279682 The maximum number of coins that can be processed in n weighings where all coins are real except for one LHR-coin.
%C A279682 An LHR-coin is a coin that can change its weight periodically from light to heavy to real to light.
%C A279682 Also the number of outcomes of n weighings such that every even-numbered imbalance that is not the last one must be followed by a balance or every odd-numbered imbalance that is not the last one must be followed by a balance.
%C A279682 The first seven terms coincide with sequence A102001, which counts all the outcomes that don't have three imbalances in a row.
%C A279682 This sequence also counts the possible outcomes starting in the light or heavy state, and for the coins starting in the real state the possible number of outcomes is a subset for coins starting in the light state.

%e A279682 Consider a(7): in addition to outcomes that do not have three imbalances in a row, we are not allowed to have any outcomes like <<=<=<<, in which the first (odd-numbered imbalance) and the fourth (even-numbered imbalance) are both followed by an imbalance. We can replace a less-than sign with a greater-than sign. That means a(7) = A102001(7) - 32 = 739 - 32 = 707.
