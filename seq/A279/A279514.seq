%N A279514 Number of terms in the cycle index Z(S_n X S_n) of the Cartesian product of the symmetric group S_n with itself that contain q cycles, where 1 <= q <= n*n. (Triangular array.)
%C A279514 A permutation (alpha,beta) from S_n X S_n acts on pairs (p,q) producing (alpha(p), beta(q)) yielding a permutation of the pairs which is factored into cycles to produce the number of cycles. Compare to Stirling numbers of the first kind, which compute the same statistic for Z(S_n).
