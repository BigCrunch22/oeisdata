%N A279027 a(n) = number of primes of the form 4k + 3 such that 2n - 4k - 3 is prime.
%C A279027 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for n >= 3.
%e A279027 a(5) = 2 because 2*5 - 4*0 - 3 = 7 is prime where 4*0 + 3 = 3 is prime of the form 4k+3 and 2*5 - 4*1 - 3 = 3 is prime where 4*1 + 3 = 7 is prime of the form 4k+3.
