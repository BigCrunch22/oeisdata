%N A279022 Greatest possible number of diagonals of a polyhedron having n edges.
%C A279022 Note that a polyhedron with 6 edges (a tetrahedron) has no diagonals and a polyhedron having exactly 7 edges does not exist.
%C A279022 If n = 3k where k > 3 than the maximum number of diagonals is achieved by a simple polyhedron with k+2 faces.
%C A279022 According to the Grünbaum-Motzkin Theorem a(3k) = 2*k^2-13*k+30, for all k>11.
%C A279022 Additionally for all k>11 a(3k+1) <= 2*k^2-13*k+36 and a(3k+2) <= 2*k^2-11*k+27.
