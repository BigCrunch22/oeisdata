%N A279767 Numbers m such that m and m+2 have the same prime signature.
%C A279767 The sequence contains some terms such that m and m + 2k (k > 1) have the same prime signature. For some terms where m and m + 2k share the same prime signature this means that every alternate element between, and including m and m + 2k have the same prime signature. The first such example is where a(41951) = 402677, a(41953) = 402679, and a(41955) = 402681, share the same prime signature {1, 1}. Also the remaining alternate terms excluding endpoints share the same prime signature. Using the above example, a(41952) = 402678 and a(41954) = 402680 share the prime signature {1,1,3}. - _Torlach Rush_, Feb 25 2018

%e A279767 18 is a term because 18 = 2 * 3^2 and 18 + 2 = 20 = 2^2 * 5.
%e A279767 19 is not a term because it is prime and 21 is the product of two primes, so the prime signatures are different.
