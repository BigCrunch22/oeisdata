%N A279367 Numbers n for which the number of distinct prime divisors of binomial(n,k) has a "local maximum" (see the unusual meaning given in comment) at k = floor(n/2).
%C A279367 The expression "local maximum" is understood here in a broad sense (as it were considering a flat-topped hill to be the same as a pointed hill): it is assumed that there is a local maximum a(n1) = a1 at n=n1 if there exists a neighborhood of n1 where the sequence is of the form {a0, a1, ..., a1, a2} with a0<a1 and a2<a1. Of course, in the case {a0,a1,a2}, where a1 is not repeated, this coincides with the usual definition of a local maximum in the strict sense.
%C A279367 This sequence is different from A020731, which concerns a global maximum.
%C A279367 Sometimes a local maximum is not the global maximum: for instance, with n = 59, the global maximum omega(binomial(59,22)) = 13 is obtained at k = 22, but there is a local maximum 12 at k = floor(59/2) = 29; this is the first occurrence absent from A020731, the next ones being 86, 91, 121, 123, 169, ... (see the link).
