%N A279048 a(n) = 0 whenever n is a practical number (A005153) otherwise least powers of 2 that when multiplied by n becomes practical.
%C A279048 A conjecture by _Zhi-Wei Sun_ states that any rational number can be expressed as the sum of distinct unit fractions whose denominators are practical numbers. To prove this conjecture, _David Eppstein_ (see link) used the fact that every natural number when repeatedly multiplied by 2 will eventually become practical.

%e A279048 a(11) = 3 because 11 * 2^3 = 88 is a practical number and 3 is the least power of 2 which when multiplied by 11 becomes practical.
