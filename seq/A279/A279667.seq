%N A279667 Number of subparts (also number of odd divisors) of the smallest number k such that the symmetric representation of sigma(k) has n layers.
%C A279667 In other words: number of subparts (also number of odd divisors) of the smallest number k such that the symmetric representation of sigma(k) has at least a part of width n.
%C A279667 Note that the number of subparts in the symmetric representation of sigma(n) equals A001227(n), the number of odd divisors of n.
%C A279667 For more information about the subparts and the layers see A279387.
%F A279667 a(n) = A001227(A250070(n)).
%e A279667 For n = 5 we have that 360 is the smallest number k whose symmetric representation of sigma(k) has parts of width 5. The structure has six subparts: [719, 237, 139, 71, 2, 2]. On the other hand, 360 has six odd divisors: {1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45}, so a(5) = 6.
