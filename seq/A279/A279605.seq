%N A279605 Triangle T(n, k) read by rows: minimal number of knight moves to reach the central square on a (2*n+1) X (2*n+1) board starting from the k-th outermost square counted from middle of first rank for k = 1..n+1, or -1 if reaching the central square is impossible.

%e A279605 T(0, 1) = 0, because the board has just 1 square where the knight must start.
%e A279605 T(1, 1) and T(1, 2) = -1, because reaching the central square with a knight is not possible on a 3 X 3 board.
%e A279605 T(2, 1) = 4, because at least 4 moves are necessary on a 5 X 5 board to reach the central square when starting from a corner square.
%e A279605 T(2, 3) = 2 because 2 moves are necessary on a 5 X 5 board to reach the central square when starting from the middle of one side. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Feb 28 2020
