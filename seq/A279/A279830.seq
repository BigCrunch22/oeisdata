%N A279830 a(n) = the least integer that is centered polygonal in exactly n ways.
%C A279830 a(n) has exactly n representations as a centered r-gonal number P(r,m) = 1 + r*m*(m+1)/2, with m > 1, r > 0.
%C A279830 a(n) appears n+1 times in A101321, due to the second column containing every positive integer.
%C A279830 a(n)-1 is the first appearance of n+1 in A007862.
