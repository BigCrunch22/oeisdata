%N A279782 Numerator of Farey fractions sorted according to increasing k, with k = numerator^2 + denominator^2. Fractions with same k are sorted in order of increasing denominator.
%C A279782 The parameter k is the square of the Euclidean distance of the corresponding points to the origin in the "denominator, numerator" representation space.
%C A279782 The fractions in order begin: 0/1, 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 1/4, 3/4, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 1/6, 4/5, 1/7, 2/7, 3/7, 5/6, ..., .
%C A279782 Note that the fraction 2/4 is not in the above since it can be reduced to 1/2.
%e A279782 The point (1,0) lies closer to the origin than any other point in the first quadrant. Therefore a(1) = 0;
%e A279782 The next point is (1,1) because it lies closer to the origin. Therefore a(2) = 1;
%e A279782 The point (2,1) lies the next closest to the origin. Therefore a(3) = 1;
%e A279782 The point (3,1) is the next closest to the origin. Therefore a(4)= 1;
%e A279782 The point (3,2) is the next closest to the origin. Therefore a(5)= 2;
%e A279782 etc.
%e A279782 The fractions 4/7 and 1/8 are respectively represented by the points (7,4) and (8,1), both points are at the same distance sqrt(65) from the origin, but 4/7 has smaller denominator than 1/8 hence a(17)=4 and a(18)=1.
