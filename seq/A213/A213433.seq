%N A213433 Irregular array T(n,k) of the numbers of distinct shapes under rotation of the non-extendable (complete) non-self-adjacent simple paths of each length within a square lattice bounded by rectangles with nodal dimensions n and 3, n >= 2.
%C A213433 The irregular array of numbers is:

%C A213433 where k is the path length in nodes. In an attempt to define the irregularity of the array, it appears that the maximum value of k is 2n+1 for 2 <= n <= 6 and 2n+2 for n >= 7. Reading this array by rows gives the sequence.
%C A213433 The asymptotic sequence for the number of distinct shapes under rotation of the complete non-self-adjacent simple paths of each nodal length k, where n >= k-1, is 2, 4, 10, 22, 38, 60, 114, 192, 342, 564, 956, 1584, 2686, 4524, 7684, 12968 for which there appears to be no obvious formula.
