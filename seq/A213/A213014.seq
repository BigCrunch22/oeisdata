%N A213014 Number of zeros following the initial 1 in n-th absolute difference of primes.
%C A213014 Related to Gilbreath's conjecture: number of "0"s preceding the first term > 1 in the n-th row of the table A036261 (= row n of the table A036262 which starts with row 0).
%C A213014 Gilbreath's conjecture would be violated if the initial 1 would not always be followed by some number (>= 0) of "0"s and then a "2" as the first term > 1. See also A089582.
