%N A213904 a(n) is the initial member of the least pair of prime quadruples (of the form p, p+2, p+6, p+8) with a difference of 30*n, with no other prime quadruple between the pair.
%C A213904 a(n) is 0 if no such pair of prime quadruples is conjectured to exist for the indicated difference.
%C A213904 When n is congruent to 2 or 5 mod 7 (A047385) no solution exists because one of the terms is divisible by 7. [_Jud McCranie_, Jun 17 2013]
