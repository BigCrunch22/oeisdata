%N A213934 Triangle with entry a(n,m) giving the number of necklaces of n beads (C_N symmetry) with n colors available for each bead, but only m distinct fixed colors, say c[1],...,c[m], are present, with m from {1,...,n} and n>=1.
%C A213934 This triangle is obtained from the partition array A212359 by summing in the row number n, for n>=1, all entries related to partitions of n with the same number of parts m.
%C A213934 a(n,m) is the number of necklaces of n beads (C_N symmetry) corresponding to the representative color multinomials obtained from all partitions of n with m parts by 'exponentiation', hence only m from the available n colors are present. As a representative multinomial of each of the p(n,m)=A008284(n,m) such m-color classes we take the one where the considered m part partition of n, [p[1],...,p[m]], written in a nonincreasing way, is distributed as exponents over c[1]^p[1]*...*c[m]^p[m]. That is only the first m colors from the n available ones are involved.
%C A213934 See the comments on A212359 for the Abramowitz-Stegun (A-St) order of partitions, and the 'exponentiation' to obtain multisets, used to encode color multinomials, from partitions.
%C A213934 The row sums of this triangle coincide with the ones of array A212359, and they are given by A072605.
%C A213934 Number of necklaces with n beads w over a k-ary alphabet {a1,a2,...,ak} such that #(w,a1) >= #(w,a2) >= ... >= #(w,ak) >= 1, where #(w,x) counts the letters x in word w (necklace analog of A226874). - _Andrew Howroyd_, Dec 20 2017

%e A213934 a(5,3) = 4 + 6 = 10, from A212359(5,4) + A212359(5,5), because k(5,3,1) = 4 and p(5,3) = 2.
%e A213934 a(2,1) = 1 because the partition [2] of n=2 with part number m=1 corresponds to the representative color multinomial (here monomial) c[1]^2=c[1]*c[1], and there is one such representative necklace. There is another necklace color monomial in this class of n=2 colors where only m=1 color is active: c[2]*c[2]. See the triangle entry A213935(2,1)=2.
%e A213934 a(3,1) = 1 from the color monomial representative c[1]^3. This class has 2 other members: c[2]^3 and c[3]^3. See A213935(3,1)=3.
%e A213934 In general a(n,1)=1 and A213935(n,1)=n from the partition [n] providing the color signature and a representative c[1]^n.
%e A213934 a(3,2)=1 from the representative color multinomial c[1]^2*c[2] (from the m=2 partition [2,1] of n=3) leading to just one representative necklace cyclic(112) (when one uses j for color c[j]). The whole class consists of A213935(3,2)=6 necklaces: cyclic(112), cyclic(113), cyclic(221), cyclic(223), cyclic(331) and  cyclic(332).
%e A213934 a(3,3)=2. The representative color multinomial is c[1]*c[2]*c[3] (from the m=3 partition [1,1,1]). There are the two non-equivalent representative necklaces cyclic(1,2,3) and cyclic(1,3,2) which constitute already the whole class (A213935(3,3)=2).
%e A213934 a(4,2) = 3 from two representative color multinomials c[1]^3*c[2] and c[1]^2*c[2]^2 (from the two m=2 partitions of n=4: [3,1] and [2,2]). The first one has one representative necklace, namely cyclic(1112), the second one originates from two representative necklaces: cyclic(1122) and cyclic(1212). Together these are the 3 necklaces counted by a(4,2). The class with the first representative consists of 4*3=12 necklaces, when all 4 colors are used. The class of the second representative consists of 2*6=12 necklaces. Together they sum up to the 24 necklaces counted by A213935(4,2).
