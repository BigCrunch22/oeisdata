%N A213672 Final term in Collatz trajectory of n that did not appear in previous trajectories.
%C A213672 This can be considered as the step down value, as beyond this point the trajectory of n reduces to a lower trajectory. When n is impure we define a(n)=0; see also A177729.
%H A213672 T. D. Noe, <a href="/A213672/b213672.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..10000</a>
%e A213672 a(7)=20 because after 20 trajectory of 7 becomes identical with trajectory of 3.
