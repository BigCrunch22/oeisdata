%N A213383 Irregular array T(n,k) of numbers/2 of non-extendable (complete) non-self-adjacent simple paths of each length within a square lattice bounded by rectangles with nodal dimensions n and 7, n >= 2.
%C A213383 The irregular array of numbers is:
%C A213383 ...k..3....4....5....6....7....8....9...10...11...12...13...14...15...16...17...18...19...20
%C A213383 .n

%C A213383 where k is the path length in nodes. There is insufficient evidence to attempt to define the irregularity of the array.  However, the maximum values of k for 2 <= n <= 11 are 11, 16, 20, 24, 29, 33, 38, 42, 46, 50. Reading this array by rows gives the sequence. One half of the numbers of paths constitute the sequence to remove the effect of the bilateral symmetry of the rectangle.
