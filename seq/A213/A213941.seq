%N A213941 Partition array a(n,k) with the total number of bracelets (D_n symmetry) with n beads, each available in n colors, with color signature given by the k-th partition of n in Abramowitz-Stegun(A-St) order.
%C A213941 This array is obtained by multiplying the entry of the array A213939(n,k) (number of bracelets (dihedral D_n symmetry) with n beads, each available in n colors, with color representative given by the n-multiset representative obtained from the k-th partition of n in A-St order after 'exponentiation') with the entry of the array A035206(n,k) (number of members in the equivalence class represented by the color multiset considered for A213939(n,k)): a(n,k)=A213939(n,k)*A035206(n,k), k=1..p(n)=A000041(n), n>=1. The row sums then give the total number of bracelets with n beads from n colors, given by A081721(n).
%C A213941 See A212359 for references, the 'exponentiation', and a link. For multiset signatures and representative multisets defining color multinomials see also a link in A213938.
%C A213941 The corresponding triangle with the summed row entries related to partitions of n with fixed number of parts is A214306.

%e A213941 Row m=7 is: 7 42 126 168 315 1890 1050 1890 2100 12600 6720 6300 18900 7560 360.
%e A213941 For the rows n=1 to n=15 see the link.
%e A213941 a(3,1) = 3 because the 3 bracelets with 3 beads coming in 3 colors have the color multinomials (here monomials) c[1]^3=c[1]*c[1]*c[1], c[2]^3 and c[3]^3. The partition of 3 is [3], the color representative is c[1]^3, and the equivalence class with color signature from the partition [3] has the three given members. There is no difference between necklace and bracelet numbers in this case.
%e A213941 a(3,2) = 6 from the color signature 2,1 with the representative multinomial c[1]^2 c[2] with coefficient A213939(3,2) = 1, the only 3-bracelet cyclic(112) (taking j for the color c[j]), and A035206(3,2) = 6 members of the whole color equivalence class: cyclic(112), cyclic(113), cyclic(221), cyclic(223), cyclic(331) and cyclic(332). There is no difference between necklaces and bracelets numbers in this case.
%e A213941 a(3,3) = 1, color signature 1^3 = 1,1,1 with representative multinomial c[1]*c[2]*c[3] with coefficient A213939(3,3)=1 from the bracelet cyclic(1,2,3). The necklace (1,3,2) becomes equivalent to this one under D_3 operation. There are no other members in this class (A035206(3,3)=1).
%e A213941 The sum of row No. 3 is 10 = A081721(3). The bracelets are 111, 222, 333, 112, 113, 221, 223, 331, 332 and 123, all taken cyclically.
