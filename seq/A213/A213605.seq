%N A213605 Lesser of a pair (x,y) of consecutive terms of A045572 (numbers coprime to 2*5), both semiprimes and such that the prime factors of x are adjacent primes to the factors of y.
%C A213605 Within the subset A045572 of numbers ending in 1, 3, 7 or 9, i.e., excluding numbers having 2 or 5 as prime factor, we look for two consecutive elements (x,y) which are both semiprimes and whose prime factors are "adjacent" primes, i.e., if x=p(i)*p(j), then we require y=p(i +/- 1)*p(j +/- 1).

%e A213605 a(1) = 403 because (403,407) are such that 403=13*31 and 407=11*37, (11,13) and (31,37) being consecutive primes.
%e A213605 a(2) = 1003 because (1003,1007) are such that 1003=17*59 and 1007=19*53, where (17,19) and (53,59) are pairs of subsequent primes.
%Y A213605 Cf. A213606 (the greater ("y") of the pair of semiprimes).
