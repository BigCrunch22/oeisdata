%e A213329 For n=4, p(4) = 7 and p(4 + 1) = 11.  We are looking for an interval containing 4 - 1 = 3 primes.  There are zero primes between 1 * 7 = 7 and 1 * 11 = 11.  There are two primes between 2 * 7 = 14 and 2 * 11 = 22 (17 and 19).  There are three primes between 3 * 7 = 21 and 3 * 11 = 33 (23, 29, and 31).  So a(4) = 3.
