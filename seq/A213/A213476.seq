%N A213476 Irregular array T(n,k) of the numbers of distinct shapes under rotation of the non-extendable (complete) non-self-adjacent simple paths of each length within a square lattice bounded by rectangles with nodal dimensions n and 7, n >= 2.
%C A213476 The irregular array of numbers is:
%C A213476 ...k..3....4....5....6....7....8....9...10...11...12...13...14...15...16...17...18....19...20...21...22...23...24

%C A213476 where k is the path length in nodes. There is insufficient evidence to attempt to define the irregularity of the array. However, the maximum values of k for 2 <= n <= 7 are 11, 16, 20, 24, 29, 33. Reading this array by rows gives the sequence. The asymptotic sequence for the number of distinct shapes under rotation of the complete non-self-adjacent simple paths of each nodal length k for n >= k-1 is 2, 4, 10, 22, 50, 104 for which there appears to be no obvious formula.
