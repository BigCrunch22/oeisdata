%N A213375 Irregular array T(n,k) of numbers/2 of non-extendable (complete) non-self-adjacent simple paths of each length within a square lattice bounded by rectangles with nodal dimensions n and 5, n >= 2.
%C A213375 The irregular array of numbers is:
%C A213375 ...k..3....4....5....6....7....8....9...10...11...12...13...14...15...16....17...18....19...20...21...22...23...24

%C A213375 where k is the path length in nodes. In an attempt to define the irregularity of the array, it appears that the maximum value of k is 3n+2 for 2 <= n <= 5, 3n+3 for 6 <= n <= 9 and 3n+4 for n >= 10. Reading this array by rows gives the sequence. One half of the numbers of paths constitute the sequence to remove the effect of the bilateral symmetry of the rectangle.
