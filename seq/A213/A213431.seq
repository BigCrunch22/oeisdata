%N A213431 Irregular array T(n,k) of the numbers of distinct shapes under rotation of the non-extendable (complete) non-self-adjacent simple paths of each length within a square lattice bounded by rectangles with nodal dimensions n and 2, n >= 2.
%C A213431 The irregular array of numbers is:
%C A213431 ....k..3...4...5...6...7...8...9..10..11..12..13..14..15
%C A213431 ..n
%C A213431 ..2....2

%C A213431 where k is the path length in nodes. In an attempt to define the irregularity of the array, it appears that the maximum value of k is n + floor((n+1)/2) for n >= 2. Reading this array by rows gives the sequence.

%F A213431 The asymptotic sequence for the number of distinct shapes under rotation of the complete non-self-adjacent simple paths of each nodal length k for n >> 0 appears to be 2*A097333(2:), that is, 2*(Sum(j=0..k-2, C(k-2-j, floor(j/2)))), for k >= 4.
