%N A213936 Number triangle with entry a(n,k), n>=1, m=1, 2, ..., n, giving the number of representative necklaces with n beads (C_n symmetry) corresponding to the color multinomial  c[1]^k*c[2]*...*c[n+1-k].
%C A213936 This table coincides with A173333 but has an extra main diagonal with entries 1.
%C A213936 a(n,k) is the number of necklaces of n beads (C_N symmetry), with colors from the repertoire {c[1],c[2],...,c[n]}, corresponding to the representative color multinomials obtained from the partition [k,1^(n-k)] of n with m=n-k+1 parts by 'exponentiation' (taking the parts in the given order as exponents of the colors), hence only m from the available n colors are present. As representative necklaces one takes the ones where the color c[1] appears k times. In particular, for k=1 the partition is [1^n] and all n colors are used, and there are (n-1)! necklaces from permuting the n colors.
%C A213936 a(n,k) appears in the representative necklace partition array A212359 in row n at the position l(n,n+1-k,1), with l(n,m,1) the position of the first partition with m parts in the list of partitions of n in A-St order. E.g., n=5, k=4: l(5,5-3,1) =2 with the partition [4,1] (used in reverse order compared to A-St).
%C A213936 See the comments on A212359 for the Abramowitz-Stegun (A-St) reference, and the 'exponentiation' to obtain multisets, used to encode color multinomials, from partitions.
%C A213936 The row sums of this triangle are given by A213937.
%F A213936 a(n,n)=1, a(n,k) = (n-1)!/k! if 1 <= k < n, else 0.
%F A213936 See also A212359 with a link for the formula for general partitions.
%F A213936 a(n,k) = A173333(n-1,k), 1 <= k < n.

%e A213936 a(4,3) = 1 because  the partition is [3,1], the color signature (exponentiation) c[.]^3 c[.]^1, and the one representative necklace (we use j for color c[j] here) is: cyclic(1112).
%e A213936 a(4,2) = 3  because  the partition is [2,1^2], the color signature c[.]^2 c[.] c[.], and the three representative necklaces are: cyclic(1123), cyclic(1132) and cyclic(1213).
%e A213936 a(5,3) = 4  because the color signature is  c[.]^3 c[.] c[.]  (from the partition [3,1^2]). and the four representative necklaces are 11123, 11132, 11213 and 11312, all taken cyclically.
