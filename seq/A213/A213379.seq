%N A213379 Irregular array T(n,k) of numbers/2 of non-extendable (complete) non-self-adjacent simple paths of each length within a square lattice bounded by rectangles with nodal dimensions n and 6, n >= 2.
%C A213379 The irregular array of numbers is:

%C A213379 where k is the path length in nodes. In an attempt to define the irregularity of the array, it appears that the maximum value of k is 4n - floor((n-8)/4) for n >= 8. Reading this array by rows gives the sequence. One half of the numbers of paths constitute the sequence to remove the effect of the bilateral symmetry of the rectangle.
