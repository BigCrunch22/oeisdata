%N A214628 Intersections of radii with the cycloid.
%C A214628 Number of times the line y=x/n intersects the cycloid specified by x=t-sin(t), y=1-cos(t) or, by symmetry, number of times the line y=n*x intersects the cycloid specified by x=1-cos(t), y=t-sin(t). It is equal to twice the number of arches that are intersected by the lines (2 intersection points by arch).
%C A214628 To find this sequence one can look for the slopes of the tangents to the n-th arch when these tangents pass through the origin (see PARI script). If one consider the indices where a(n) change value, one gets: 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, ... that may well be A062389, as this is the slope of the line joining the origin to the summit of the n-th arch. Will this be true for all n? - _Michel Marcus_, Aug 29 2013
