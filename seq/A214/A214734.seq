%N A214734 Sum_{k=1..n} floor(k*p/q), where (p,q) are either coprime positive integers or q=1 or p=1, n*p>=q, ordered by (n + p + q) ascending, then n ascending, then p ascending.
%C A214734 Since this is a sequence with 3 indexes (n,p,q), then the order proposed is an ordering by planes of 3D-discrete points (similar to a diagonal ordering of 2D-discrete points). It is not possible to order by rows, columns since n, p, q are boundless.
%C A214734 This sequence generalizes other sequences like A130518, A001840, A058937, A130519, A001972 and maybe others (most of those sequences are replica of each other up to an offset), by providing a closed formula (see formulas).
%F A214734 a(n, p, q) = Sum_{k=1..n} floor(k*p/q) defines the sequence.
%F A214734 a(n, p, q) = n*(n+1)*p/q/2 - floor(n/q) * (q-1)/2 - Sum_{k=1...(n mod q)} (k*p mod q)/q (the remaining sum has at most q-1 terms, and can assume at most q values when n varies, i.e., that sum for n is equal to the sum for n+q, so the computation of a(n, p, q) requires adding at most (q+1) terms).

%e A214734 a(n, 1, 3) = n*(n+1)/ 6 - floor(n/3) - Sum_{k=1..(n mod 3)} (k mod 3) = n*(n+1)/ 6 - floor(n/3) - (4 mod 3)/3 = A130518(n).
%e A214734 Example of the ordering (n,p,q): (1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,1), (2,1,1), (1,1,3), (1,3,1), (2,1,2), (2,2,1), (3,1,1), (1,1,4), ...
