%N A214409 a(n) is the smallest conjectured m such that the irreducible fraction m/n is a known abundancy index.
%C A214409 The abundancy index of a number k is sigma(k)/k. When n is prime, (n+1)/n is irreducible and abund(n) = (n+1)/n, so a(n) = n + 1.
%C A214409 A known abundancy index is related to a limit. Terms of the sequence have been built with a limit of 10^30. So when n is composite, the values for a(n) are conjectural. A higher limit could provide smaller values.
%C A214409 If m < k < sigma(m) and k is relatively prime to m, then k/m is an abundancy outlaw. Hence if r/s is an abundancy index with gcd(r, s) = 1, then r >= sigma(s). [Stanton and Holdener page 3]. Since a(n) is coprime to n, this implies that a(n) >= sigma(n).
%C A214409 When a(n)=A214413(n), this means that a(n) is sure to be the least m satisfying the property.
