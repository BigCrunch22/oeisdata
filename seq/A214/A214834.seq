%N A214834 a(n) is the smallest prime number such that both a(n) and (4n + 2) - a(n) are prime numbers of the form 4k + 3.
%C A214834 Any even number of the form of 4k + 2 (k > 0) can be partitioned into 4k + 2 = (4i+3) + (4j+3), where i + j + 1 = k.  This sequence implies the conjecture that for any number in the form of 4k + 2 (k > 0), there is a partition for which 4i + 3 and 4j + 3 are both prime.
%C A214834 Conjecture tested true up to n=1000000000. In case the conjecture is not true, zero could be used to represent the missing entries.

%e A214834 Let n = 4.  Then 4n + 2 = 14, and the pairs of prime numbers of the form 4k + 3 that sum to 14 are (3, 11), (7, 7).  The smallest number of 3, 11, 7, 8 is 3, so a(4) = 3.
