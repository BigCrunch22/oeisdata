%N A214673 Floor of the moduli of the zeros of the complex Lucas function.
%C A214673 For the complex Lucas function L(z) and its zeros see a comment on A214671 where also the Koshy reference is given.
%C A214673 The modulus rho(k) of the zeros is sqrt(x_0(k)^2 + y_0(k)^2), with x_0(k) = (2*k+1)*(alpha/2) and y_0(k) = (2*k+1)*(a/2), where alpha := 2*(Pi^2)/(Pi^2 + (2*log(phi))^2) and a := 4*Pi*log(phi)/(Pi^2 + (2*log(phi))^2) (see the Fibonacci case
%C A214673  A214657). phi:=(1+sqrt(5))/2. This leads to rho(k) = (k+1/2)*tau, with tau:= 2*Pi/sqrt(Pi^2 + (2*phi)^2), known from the Fibonacci case. tau is approximately 1.912278633.
%C A214673 The zeros lie in the complex plane on a straight line with angle Phi = -arctan(2*log(phi)/Pi). They are equally spaced with distance tau given above. Phi is approximately -.2972713044, corresponding to about -17.03 degrees. This is the same line like in the Fibonacci case A214657, and the zeros of the Lucas function are just shifted on this line by tau/2, approximately 0.9561393165.
%F A214673 a(n) = floor((2*k+1)*tau/2 ), n>=0, with tau/2 = rho(0) defined in the comment section.
%Y A214673 Cf. A214671, A214672, A214657 (Fibonacci case).
