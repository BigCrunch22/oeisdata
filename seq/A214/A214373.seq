%N A214373 Irregular array T(n,k) of the numbers of non-extendable (complete) non-self-adjacent simple paths ending at each of a minimal subset of nodes within a square lattice bounded by rectangles with nodal dimensions n and 7, n >= 2.
%C A214373 The subset of nodes is contained in the top left-hand quarter of the rectangle and has nodal dimensions floor((n+1)/2) and 4 to capture all geometrically distinct counts.
%C A214373 The quarter-rectangle is read by rows.
%C A214373 The irregular array of numbers is:

%C A214373 where k indicates the position of the end node in the quarter-rectangle.
%C A214373 For each n, the maximum value of k is 4*floor((n+1)/2).
%C A214373 Reading this array by rows gives the sequence.
