%N A214579 Number of partitions of n in which each part is divisible by the next and have no parts equal to 1.
%C A214579 Also number of generalized Bethe trees with n+1 vertices having root degree >=2.
%C A214579 A generalized Bethe tree is a rooted tree in which vertices at the same level have the same degree; they are called uniform trees in the Goldberg and Livshits reference.
%C A214579 There is a simple bijection between generalized Bethe trees with n edges and partitions of n in which each part is divisible by the next (the parts are given by the number of edges at the successive levels). We have the correspondences: number of edges --- sum of parts; root degree --- last part; number of leaves --- first part; height --- number of parts.
