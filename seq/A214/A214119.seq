%N A214119 Irregular array T(n,k) of the numbers of non-extendable (complete) non-self-adjacent simple paths ending at each of a minimal subset of nodes within a square lattice bounded by rectangles with nodal dimensions n and 2, n >= 2.
%C A214119 The subset of nodes is contained in the top left-hand quarter of the rectangle and has nodal dimensions floor((n+1)/2) and 1 to capture all geometrically distinct counts. The quarter-rectangle is read by rows. The irregular array of numbers is:

%F A214119 Let T(n,k) denote an element of the irregular array then it appears that T(n,k) = A000045(n+3) - 3, n >= 2, k = 1 and T(n,k) = 0, n >= 2, k >= 2.
%e A214119 When n = 2, the number of times (NT) each node in the rectangle is the end node (EN) of a complete non-self-adjacent simple path is
%e A214119 EN 0 1
%e A214119    2 3
%e A214119 NT 2 2
%e A214119    2 2
%e A214119 To limit duplication, only the top left-hand corner 2 is stored in the sequence, i.e. T(2,1) = 2.
