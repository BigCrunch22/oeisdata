%N A214576 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of partitions of n in which each part is divisible by the next and have last part equal to k (1<=k<=n).
%C A214576 T(n,k) is also the number of generalized Bethe trees with n edges and root degree k.
%C A214576 A generalized Bethe tree is a rooted tree in which vertices at the same level have the same degree; they are called uniform trees in the Goldberg and Livshits reference.
%C A214576 There is a simple bijection between generalized Bethe trees with n edges and partitions of n in which each part is divisible by the next (the parts are given by the number of edges at the successive levels). We have the correspondences: root degree --- last part; number of leaves --- first part; height --- number of parts.
%C A214576 Sum of entries in row n is A003238(n+1).

%F A214576 T(n,k)=a(n/k -1) if k|n and = 0 otherwise; here a(n) is defined by a(0)=1, a(n) = sum_{j|n}a(j-1). We have a(n) = A003238(n+1) = number of  partitions of n in which each part is divisible by the next one.
%e A214576 T(9,3)=2 because we have (6,3) and (3,3,3).
