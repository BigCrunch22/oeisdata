%N A214301 Smallest limiting value of n under iteration of "Sum of its digits raised to its digits power" (A045512).
%C A214301 Numbers that yield a fixed value after adding its digits raised to its digits power are called "Munchhausen Numbers" (A046253); i.e. 3435 = 3^3 + 4^4 + 3^3 + 5^5.
%C A214301 Since (9^9)*n < 10^n for n > 12; every initial value should eventually reach a "Munchhausen Number" or a cycle.
%C A214301 This sequence assigns to n that Munchhausen number or the lowest member of the cycle.
%C A214301 About 80% of the numbers reach the 288 cycle; 15% the 3439 cycle; 5% the 50119 cycle and less than 0.1% the fixed value 438579088; only few sporadic numbers reach 1 or 3435.
%C A214301 It has been proved that there are only four Munchhausen numbers (0, 1, 3435 and 438579088) with the convention of 0^0 = 0.
%C A214301 Open questions: are there any other cycles than those described here? What is the % of numbers < 10^n reaching a specific limiting value for n = 1, 2, 3, etc...?
