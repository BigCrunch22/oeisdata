%N A214033 Places n where A214030(n) = n or A214030(n) = n-2.
%C A214033 It always has been one of the great mysteries of mathematics, that the superdiagonal sequence of A001177 consists of prime numbers A000057.
%C A214033 Here, regarding A214031 and A214032,there is the further conjecture that these two disjoint sequences are primes and roughly comparable in density. It isn't clear that these two sequences have a density, without appealing to the Riemann Hypothesis, but they are certainly close to one another in growing size.
%C A214033 Since these two sequences are disjoint, it is natural to take their union.
