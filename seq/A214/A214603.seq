%N A214603 Location of the first gap of exactly n in Ulam numbers, or zero if none is known. The zero terms are conjectural.
%C A214603 Some terms are not believed to exist. However, the first gap of 35 occurs at 483379914 and the first gap of 88 occurs at 1127544124. - _Jud McCranie_, Jul 31 2012
%H A214603 Jud McCranie, <a href="/A214603/a214603.txt">Known terms up to 890</a>
%e A214603 The first gap of 5 in Ulam numbers occurs after 48, so a(5) = 48.
%Y A214603 Cf. A002858, A080287, A080288.
