%N A214566 Number of star-vertices in the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number n.
%C A214566 A vertex v in a rooted tree is said to be a star-vertex if all the children of v are leaves.
%C A214566 The Matula-Goebel number of a rooted tree can be defined in the following recursive manner: to the one-vertex tree there corresponds the number 1; to a tree T with root degree 1 there corresponds the t-th prime number, where t is the Matula-Goebel number of the tree obtained from T by deleting the edge emanating from the root; to a tree T with root degree m>=2 there corresponds the product of the Matula-Goebel numbers of the m branches of T.

%F A214566 Let G(n)=G(n;t,z) be the bivariate generating polynomial of the star-vertices of the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number n with respect to number of children (marked by t) and level (marked by z). Then G(1)=0; G(2)=t; if n = m-th prime (m>=2), then G(n)=z*G(m); if n=rs (r,s>=2) and both r and s are powers of 2, then G(n)=G(r)*G(s)  (=t^{log[2](n)}); if n=rs (r,s>=2) and r is a power of 2 while s is not, then G(n)=G(s); if n=rs (r,s>=2) and s is a power of 2 while r is not, then G(n)=G(r); if n=rs (r,s>=2) and r and s are not powers of 2, then G(n)=G(r)+G(s). a(n)=G(n;1,1). The Maple program is based on these recurrence relations. With the given Maple program, the command G(n) yields the bivariate generating polynomial.
%e A214566 a(9)=2 because the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number 9 is the path A-B-R-C-D with root R; B and C are the star-vertices.
%e A214566 a(5)=1 because the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number 5 is the path R-A-B-C with root R; B is the only star-vertex.
%e A214566 a(16)=1 because the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number 16 is the star K_{1,4}; the root is the only star-vertex.
%e A214566 G(987654321) =2*t*z + 3*t^2*z^2 + t*z^2 + t*z^4 + t^4*z^2 (reader may verify this on Fig. 2 of the Deutsch paper).
