%N A214625 Let n=r_1*r_2*...*r_k is Fermi-Dirac factorization of n (see comment). Set g(n) = n + k - 1 and g_i, i>=0 (g_0(n) = n, g_1=g), is i-th iteration of g. a(n) is the minimal i such that g_i(n) is in A050376.
%C A214625 Recall that every n>=2 has a unique factorization over distinct numbers from A050376 which is called Fermi-Dirac factorization of n. The sequence is a dual to A213980.
%C A214625 Conjecture: a(n) exists for every n >= 2.

%e A214625 Since 24 = 2*3*4, then g_1(24) = 24 + 3 - 1 = 26; analogously, g_1(26) = 26 +2 -1 = 27, g_1(27) = 27 + 2 - 1 = 28, g_1(28) = 28 + 2 - 1 = 29 is in A050376. We used 4 iterations, therefore, a(24) = 4.
