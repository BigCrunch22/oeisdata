%N A214422 Least number k > 9 that is palindromic in exactly n bases b, with 2 <= b <= 10.
%C A214422 There are no other terms < 10^12. The ultimate goal is to find (probably a very large) k that is palindromic in all 9 bases 2 to 10.
%e A214422 19 is not palindromic in bases 2 to 10.
%e A214422 11 is palindromic in base 10.
%e A214422 15 is palindromic in bases 2 and 4.
%e A214422 10 is palindromic in bases 3, 4, and 9.
%e A214422 121 is palindromic in bases 3, 7, 8, and 10.
%Y A214422 Cf. A050813, A214423, A214424, A214425, A214426 (palindromic in 0-4 bases).
