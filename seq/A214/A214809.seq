%N A214809 A214330 prefixed by a 0 consists of a concatenation of strings 0111010(01)^n, each such string ending with n >= 0 copies of 10; sequence gives successive values of n.
%C A214809 If we change the three initial terms of A214551 (as in A214331 and A214626), again read the sequence mod 2, and decompose the result into strings 0111010(01)^n, will the sequence of values of n have anything in common with the current sequence? Is A214809 in any way characteristic of this family of sequences?
