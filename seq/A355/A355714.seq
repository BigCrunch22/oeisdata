%N A355714 Numbers k > 0 such that A090252(A355176(k)) does not equal prime(k)^2.
%C A355714 In contrast to A354169 (a set theoretic analog of A090252) where we observe many as yet unproved regularities, in A090252 the situation appears to be more complicated. This sequence is intended to help spot these irregularities and perhaps lead to further rules, which probably have no analogy in A354169.
%C A355714 In most cases A090252(A355176(n)) equals prime(a(n))*p where p is prime. Surprisingly p is in many cases greater than prime(a(n)).
%C A355714 Is this sequence infinite?
%F A355714 A090252(A355176(a(n))) <> A000040(a(n))^2.
%F A355714 A000040(a(n)) divides A090252(A355176(a(n))).
%F A355714 A000040(a(n)) divides A090252(2*A355176(a(n))+1).
%Y A355714 Cf. A000040, A001248, A090252, A354169, A355176.
