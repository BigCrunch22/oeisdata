%N A355270 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers on a square spiral such that the sum of adjacent pairs of numbers within each row, column and diagonal is distinct in that row, column and diagonal.
%C A355270 In the first 2 million terms the largest number is 1959, while the number 1, the most commonly occurring number, appears 10893 times. See the linked images.
%H A355270 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A355270/a355270.png">Image of the first 2 million terms</a>. The values are scaled across the spectrum from red to violet, with the value ranges increasing towards the violet end to give more color weighting to the larger numbers.
%H A355270 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A355270/a355270_1.png">Distribution of a(n) for the first 2 million terms</a>. The number 1 appears 10893 times. The second maximum occurs at n ~ 500.

%e A355270 a(25) = 6 as when a(25) is placed, at coordinate (2,-2) relative to the starting square, its adjacent squares are a(10) = 3, a(9) = 4, a(24) = 3. The sums of adjacent pairs of numbers in a(25)'s column are 3 + 3 = 6, 3 + 4 = 7, 4 + 4 = 8, in its northwest diagonal are 4 + 1 = 5, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 2 = 4, and in its row are 3 + 2 = 5, 2 + 4 = 6, 4 + 4 = 8. Setting a(25) to 1 would create a sum of 5 with its diagonal neighbor 4, but 5 has already occurred as a sum on this diagonal. Similarly numbers 2, 3, 4 and 5 can be eliminated as they create sums with the three adjacent numbers, 3, 4, and 3, which have already occurred along the corresponding column, diagonal or row. This leaves 6 as the smallest number which creates new sums, namely 9, 10 and 9, with its three neighbors that have not already occurred along the corresponding column, diagonal and row.
