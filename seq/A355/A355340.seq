%N A355340 a(0) = 0; for n >= 1, a(n) = a(n-1) XOR A001511(n), where XOR denotes bitwise exclusive-or (A003987) and A001511 is the binary ruler function.
%C A355340 Related to the Thue-Morse sequence, A010060, which gives the rightmost binary bit of each term. The next bit is given by the closely related A269723.
%C A355340 If we replace A001511(n) in the definition by A006519(n) = 2^(A001511(n)-1) we get Gray code (A003188).
%C A355340 Interesting symmetries of the sequence seem more apparent with the terms aligned in suitable periods, such as the arrangement in the example section.
