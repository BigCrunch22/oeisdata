%N A355017 a(n) is the number of bases in 2..n in which the sum of the digits of n is prime.
%C A355017 The graph of (n,a(n)) shows an interesting structure, somewhat resembling a comet with four tails. Starting at the bottom tail and going upwards:
%C A355017 Observations:
%C A355017 The bottom "tail" contains all n with both 2 and 3 as prime factors, i.e., numbers n in A008588 (1/6 of all n).
%C A355017 The second "tail" contains all n with 2 as a prime factor but not 3, i.e., numbers n in A047235 (1/3 of all n).
%C A355017 The third "tail" contains all n with 3 as a prime factor but 2, i.e., numbers n in A016945 (1/6 of all n).
%C A355017 The top "tail" contains all n with neither 2 nor 3 as a prime factor, i.e., numbers n in A007310 (1/3 of all n).
%C A355017 The bottom of each "tail" contains n with 5 as a prime factor. Moving up within each "tail," the prime factors of each n tend to increase.

%e A355017 For n=7, express 7 in all bases from 2 to 7, then add the numbers, counting those which are prime:
%e A355017   base 2: 1 1 1 --> 1+1+1=3 prime
%e A355017   base 3: 2 1   --> 2+1=3   prime
%e A355017   base 4: 1 3   --> 1+3=4   nonprime
%e A355017   base 5: 1 2   --> 1+2=3   prime
%e A355017   base 6: 1 1   --> 1+1=2   prime
%e A355017   base 7: 1     --> 1=1     nonprime
%e A355017 The sum of the digits of the base-b expansion of 7 in 4 different bases b (2, 3, 5, and 6) from base 2 to 7 is prime, so a(7)=4.
