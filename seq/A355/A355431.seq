%N A355431 Numbers k whose binary expansion, when interpreted in base -1+i, gives a Gaussian prime.
%C A355431 Complex base -1+i is a bijection between integers k and Gaussian integers z(k) = A318438(k) + A318439(k)*i.
%C A355431 The present sequence is those k where z(k) is a Gaussian prime.
%C A355431 The Gaussian primes have an 8-way symmetry in the complex plane so that this sequence is also the Gaussian primes in the conjugate complex base -1-i.
%C A355431 The graphs on the complex plane (see links) show the Gaussian primes mapped and connected by lines in the order in which their indices appear in {a(n)}. The numbers in base -1+i tile the complex plane in the twin dragon fractal pattern, and the Gaussian primes are numerous such that the fractal is still discernible.
%C A355431 The only even terms are 2, 6, 14, and 58, since even terms correspond to Gaussian integers divisible by -1+i, and the base-(-1+i) expansions of -1+i, -1-i, 1+i, and 1-i are 10, 110, 1110, and 111010 respectively. - _Jianing Song_, Oct 02 2022

%e A355431 123 is a term since z(123) = 2+7i is a Gaussian prime.
%e A355431 124 is not a term because z(124) = 2+4i is not a Gaussian prime.
