%N A355072 a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest positive number whose sum a(n) + a(n-1) is distinct from all previous sums, a(i) + a(i-1), i=1..n-1, whose product a(n) * a(n-1) is distinct from all previous products, a(i) * a(i-1), i=1..n-1, and whose difference |a(n) - a(n-1)| is distinct from all previous differences, |a(i) - a(i-1)|, i=1..n-1.
%C A355072 For n up to ~35000 the vast majority of terms are concentrated along three lines, the lowest being near the x-axes; see the first linked image. In this same range there are many terms equal to 1; see A355135. Beyond this range the terms no longer fall along the upper-most line and the number of terms equal to 1 greatly diminishes. The reason for this change in behavior is unknown. The remaining upper-most line has a gradient close to 1 and contains multiple fixed points; see A355136 and the second linked image. The sequence it conjectured to contain all the positive integers.
