%N A355328 Decimal expansion of the number whose binary expansion differs from its decimal expansion only in the first digit.
%C A355328 The decimal fraction 0.1 has binary expansion starting with 0.0001...; copying the suffix 001 (3 digits, as 3 < log_2(10) < 4) we obtain 0.1001, which expands to 0.00011001101, etc.
%C A355328 Alternatively the process can be described as greedily expressing 1/2 with digits of weights 1/2^n-1/10^n. With f(n)=1/2^n-1/10^n, 0.5 = f(1)+f(4)+f(5)+f(8)+f(9)+f(11)...
