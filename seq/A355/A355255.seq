%N A355255 Irregular table read by rows: a(n,k) gives the number of distinct necklaces that appear in the following procedure: starting with the n-bead, (0,1)-necklace given by k written in binary, repeatedly take the first differences (mod 2) of the beads. 0 <= k < 2^n.

%C A355255 Conjecture: a(2^m,1) = 2^m + 1 for all m > 1.
%C A355255 Conjecture: a(m,1) is a power of 2 whenever m is not a power of 2.
