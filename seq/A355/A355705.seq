%N A355705 Indices k of partition function p where p(k) and p(k) - 2 are twin primes.
%C A355705 Because asymptotically size of partitions number function p(n) ~ O(exp(sqrt(n))), and probability of primality of p(n) ~ O(1/sqrt(n)) and combined probability of primality of p(n) and p(n)+-2 is ~ O(1/n), the sum of the prime probabilities is diverging and there are no obvious restrictions on primality; therefore, this sequence may be conjectured to be infinite.
%C A355705 a(5) > 10^7.
%e A355705 4 is a term because A000041(4) = 5, and 3 and 5 are twin primes.
%e A355705 5 is a term because A000041(5) = 7, and 5 and 7 are twin primes.
