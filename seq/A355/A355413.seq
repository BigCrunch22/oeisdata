%N A355413 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of positive numbers such that, for n>1, a(n) AND a(n-1) is distinct from all previous AND operations between adjacent terms, where AND is the binary AND operator.
%C A355413 Each term must be chosen so that a subsequent term can always been found. This implies, for example, no power of 2 can ever be a term as the result of an AND operation between such a number and any following number will be either 0 or the power of 2, both of which have already appeared as the result of AND operations.
%C A355413 Every a(n) where n is odd is a fixed point.

%e A355413 a(3) = 3 as a(2) = 3 and 3 AND 3 = 3, which has not occurred earlier for any AND's between adjacent terms. Note that a(3) cannot equal 2 = 10_2 as the result of any subsequent AND operation with 2 would be 0 or 2, both of which have already occurred.
