%N A355852 Numbers that can be written as the product of two of its divisors such that the binary value of the number has the same length as the concatenation of the binary values of the divisors and differs by only one bit from the divisor concatenation.
%C A355852 See A355857 for the smallest number that shares n out of n+1 bits with the divisor binary concatenation.
