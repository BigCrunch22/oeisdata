%C A355617 A regular pattern of rectangles, each 10 times larger than the last, appears on the scatter plot of this sequence. However, there are moments where the sequence deviates from its current rectangle to drop down to lower orders of magnitude or jump up to higher ones. Additionally, chaotic behavior can be observed at values of n in the approximate intervals [60000, 63000], [68000, 82000], and [85000, 100000].
%C A355617 Not all integers appear in this sequence. The smallest number that will never occur is 130, as the only way to achieve the number is through 129, which had already been used to jump to 921.
