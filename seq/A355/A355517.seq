%N A355517 Number of nonisomorphic systems enumerated by A334254; that is, the number of inequivalent closure operators on a set of n elements where all singletons are closed.
%C A355517 The T_1 axiom states that all singleton sets {x} are closed.
%C A355517 For n>1, this property implies strictness (meaning that the empty set is closed).

%e A355517 a(0) = 1 counts the empty set, while a(1) = 2 counts {{1}} and {{},{1}}.
%e A355517 For a(2) = 1 the closure system is as follows:  {{1,2},{1},{2},{}}.
%e A355517 The a(3) = 4 inequivalent set-systems of closed sets are:
%e A355517   {{1,2,3},{1},{2},{3},{}}
%e A355517   {{1,2,3},{1,2},{1},{2},{3},{}}
%e A355517   {{1,2,3},{1,2},{1,3},{1},{2},{3},{}}
%e A355517   {{1,2,3},{1,2},{1,3},{2,3},{1},{2},{3},{}}.
%Y A355517 The number of all closure operators is given in A102896, while A193674 contains the number of all nonisomorphic ones.
%Y A355517 For T_1 closure operators and their strict counterparts, see A334254 and A334255, respectively; the only difference is a(1).
%Y A355517 Cf. A326960, A326961, A326979.
