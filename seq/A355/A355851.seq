%N A355851 The difference between the indices of the two most recent instances of a(n-1), not including a(n-1) itself, or 0 if not enough such instances exist.
%C A355851 This is similar to Van Eck's sequence: A181391.
%e A355851 Say you have 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, ?
%e A355851 The previous term is a 2, and the distance between the pair of most recent 2s before that is 2, hence ? = 2.
%Y A355851 Cf. A181391.
