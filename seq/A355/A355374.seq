%N A355374 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not yet appeared such that the number of proper divisors of a(n) equals the number of 1-bits in the binary expansion of a(n-1).
%C A355374 In the first 700 terms the fixed points are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 16, 21, 22, 35, 48, 168, 412, 428. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
