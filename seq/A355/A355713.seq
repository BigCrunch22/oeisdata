%N A355713 Numbers k such that k and k+1 have the same sum of 5-smooth divisors.
%C A355713 Numbers k such that A355584(k) = A355584(k+1).
%C A355713 Equivalently, numbers k such that the largest 5-smooth divisors of k and k+1, A355582(k) and A355582(k+1), have the same sum of divisors (A000203).
%C A355713 For all the terms k, both k and k+1 are not squarefree: each of the two largest 5-smooth divisors, of k and k+1, cannot be squarefree, since the squarefree 5-smooth numbers are the divisors of 30 = 2*3*5 (A018255) whose values of sigma (A000203), {1, 3, 4, 6, 12, 18, 24, 72}, are not shared with sigma of any other 5-smooth number.
%C A355713 Apparently, all the terms are of only two types: numbers k such that A355582(k) = 16 and A355582(k+1) = 25, or numbers k such that A355582(k) = 25 and A355582(k+1) = 16. Both types are infinite sequences: The first type is the sequence of numbers of the form 2224 + 2400*m, where m is not congruent to 1 (mod 5), and the second type is the sequence of numbers of the form 175 + 2400*m, where m is not congruent to 3 (mod 5). If there are no other terms, then this sequence is a linear recurrence with a signature (1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,-1). The question of the existence of other types is equivalent to the question of the existence of two coprime 5-smooth numbers other than 16 and 25 whose sums of divisors are equal.
%C A355713 Are there runs of 3 consecutive numbers with the same sum of 5-smooth divisors? There are no such runs below 5*10^10.
