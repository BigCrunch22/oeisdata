%N A355682 The "finer" of 2 representations of the Cantor middle thirds set viewed from a quarter point that lies at a(0) (the second 1 in the data).
%C A355682 Each occurrence of the consecutive values 2, 1, 0, -1, -2 represents the endpoints, quarter points and middle point of a scaled image of the Cantor middle thirds set. The figure in the examples illustrates the relevance of the values of the terms.
%C A355682 a(n) is the restriction of a function, f, which is defined for all integers as specified in the formula section. For reasons of presentation, the offset is chosen to be -9. (Beyond -9, the next nonzero value of f is f(-45) = -2.) Essentially though, we can consider f to be giving a microscopic view of the middle thirds set around either quarter point.
%C A355682 f:Z -> {-2,-1,0,1,2} is used to generate the closure under multiplication by -3 of the scaled Cantor middle thirds set spanning [-1,3]. So this process also generates similar Cantor sets spanning [-9,3], [-9,27], [-81,27], ... . 0 is clearly a quarter point in all these intervals.
%C A355682 Formally, define c: Z -> P(R) so that c(n) is the empty set if f(n) = 0, otherwise the translated Cantor middle thirds set centered at n+f(n)/9 and scaled by 4/9. Let C_oo be the union of c(m) for all n in Z. C_oo is the closure under multiplication by -3 of the scaled translated Cantor middle thirds set spanning [-1,3].
%C A355682 Note that where f(n) is a lone 0 between 1 and -1, n lies in a gap (empty interval in C_oo) of length 1/6 + 1 + 1/6 = 4/3; whereas a run of k 0's between a -2 and a 2 represents a gap of length 1/2 + k + 1/2 = k+1. The positions of lone 0's are given in A355680.

%F A355682 a(n) = f(n), where f:Z -> {-2,-1,0,1,2}; f(0) = 1, for integer m, -1 <= i <= 1, writing x = -3*f(-m) - 9i, f(3m+i) = if |x-4| < 3 then x-4 otherwise if |x+4| < 3 then x+4 otherwise 0.
%F A355682 The generation of f can be understood, in the manner of a morphism, using the following table:
%F A355682   f(-m)  ->  f(3m-1)   f(3m)   f(3m+1)
%F A355682    -2    ->      0        2        1
%F A355682    -1    ->      0       -1       -2
%F A355682     0    ->      0        0        0
%F A355682     1    ->      2        1        0
%F A355682     2    ->     -1       -2        0
%F A355682 For j >= 0, k >= 1, m = (-3)^j, q = 2*3^(j-1):
%F A355682   (1) for -q < i < q, f(m*A355680(k)+i) = 0; -- represents a deleted middle third
%F A355682   (2) for 4m/3-q <= i <= 4m/3+q, f(m*A355680(k)+i) = -f(m*A355680(k)-i).
%F A355682 a(2n) = A355681(3n).
%F A355682 a(6n) = A355681(n).
%F A355682 a(9n) = a(n).
%F A355682 The following are equivalent: a(n-2) = 2, a(n-1) = 1, a(n+1) = -1, a(n+2) = -2; in which case a(n-5) = a(n-4) = a(n-3) = a(n) = a(n+3) = a(n+4) = a(n+5) = 0 (subject, on an index-by-index basis, to an index not being less than the sequence offset).

%e A355682 Notice that n=0 marks the 1/4 point of the scaled middle thirds set spanning [-1/9,1/3], the 3/4 point of the similar set spanning [-1,1/3] and the 1/4 point of the set spanning [-1,3]. This continues at larger scales, 0 being at the 3/4 point of the similar set spanning [-9,3], the 1/4 point of [-9,27] and so on. Likewise at smaller scales, n=0 marks the 3/4 point of the similar set spanning [-1/9,1/27], the 1/4 point of [-1/81,1/27] etc.
