%N A355885 a(n) is the smallest odd k such that k + 2^m is a de Polignac number for m = 1..n.
%C A355885 All terms of this sequence are composite numbers.
%C A355885 Note that all positive values of a(n) + 2^i - 2^j are composite from i = 1 to n.
%C A355885 Conjecture: this sequence is infinite and bounded, namely a(n) = K for all n >= N.
%C A355885 If so, then K - 2^j is a Sierpiński number for every 1 < 2^j < K, by the dual Sierpiński conjecture. Note that each positive value of K + 2^i - 2^j is composite for every i > 0.
%C A355885 The number K can be a (partial) solution to the open problem: are there odd (composite) numbers k such that both |(k -+ 2^m)*2^n +- 1| are composite for every pair of positive integers m,n?
%C A355885 By the dual Sierpiński and Riesel conjectures, these are odd numbers k such that both ||k -+ 2^m| +- 2^n| are composite for m, n > 0.
%C A355885 The conditional theorem: by the dual Sierpiński conjecture and by the dual Riesel conjecture; if p is an odd prime and m is a positive integer, then there exist two numbers n such that both |(p -+ 2^m)*2^n +- 1| are prime.
%C A355885 So if such numbers k exist, they must be composite.
%e A355885 a(3) = 7385, because 7385 is the smallest number k such that k+2^1, k+2^2, k+2^3 are de Polignac numbers 7387, 7389, 7393.
