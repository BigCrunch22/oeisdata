%N A355314 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers on a square spiral such that the difference between all orthogonally adjacent pairs of numbers is distinct.
%C A355314 For larger n the sequences typically consists of a repeating pattern of three values - the first one is small, less than 5, a second larger value, and then a third even larger value, typically around double the previous value. However this pattern is occasionally broken by a fourth or fifth larger value which shifts the position of the subsequent repeating block of three values. This leads to the overall spiral pattern showing a uniform pattern of numbers crossed by random zig-zag lines of values not following the three-value pattern. See the linked color image.

%e A355314 a(8) = 15 as when a(8) is placed, at coordinate (1,-1) relative to the starting square, its two orthogonally adjacent squares are a(1) = 0 and a(7) = 7. The ten previously occurring differences between all orthogonally adjacent pairs up to a(7) are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12. The lowest unused difference is 8 thus a(8) = 15 can be chosen as it results in differences with its two orthogonal neighbors of 15 - 7 = 8 and 15 = 0 = 15, neither of which has previously occurred.
