%N A355483 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not yet appeared such that the number of 1-bits in the binary expansion of a(n) equals the number of divisors of a(n-1).
%C A355483 This sequence is similar to A355482 except that here all divisors of a(n-1) are counted.
%C A355483 The fixed points in the first 41 terms are 1,2,3,10.
%C A355483 It is unknown if all numbers eventually appear.
%C A355483 Since a(41) has 6144 divisors, a(42) = 2^6144 - 1  is a 1850-digit number.
%e A355483 a(7) = 23 = 10111_2 as a(6) = 15 which has four divisors, and 23 is the smallest unused number that has four 1-bits in its binary expansion.
%Y A355483 Cf. A355482 (proper divisors), A355374, A000120, A032741, A005179, A027751.
