%N A355903 Variant of Stepping Stones problem: here the stone you place only needs to divide the sum of its 8 neighbors.
%C A355903 To find a(n), start by placing n stones labeled 1 on an infinite chessboard.
%C A355903 Set k=2. At step k, you must place a stone labeled k in a square where the sum of its neighbors is x*k for some x >= 1. That is, the sum of the neighbors must be an integral multiple of k.
%C A355903 If there is no way to do that, this game ends, and you win k-1 dollars. If you can do it, you increment k and repeat.
%C A355903 Then a(n) = maximum number of dollars you can win with optimal play for any initial placement of the n starting stones.
%C A355903 The sequence was proposed by _Skylark Xentha Murphy-Davies_ on Sep 16 2022. She found lower bounds for a(2), a(3), and a(4). On Sep 17 2022, _Hugo van der Sanden_ showed that her lower bound for a(2) was the correct value, and found the values of a(3) and a(4).
%C A355903 In the original version of the problem (see A337663) each stone that you place must equal the sum of its 8 neighbors.
