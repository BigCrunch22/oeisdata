%N A355475 Numbers that are sparsely totient (A036913) and of least prime signature (A025487).
%C A355475 All sparsely totient numbers are even, but not all sparsely totient numbers have least prime signature.
%C A355475 The present sequence is infinite, as it includes all primorials greater than one (A002110); see Masser and Shiu for proof.

%e A355475 The totient of 18 is 6, which is smaller than the totient of all larger natural numbers; but 18 does not have least prime signature, so it is not a term of this sequence.
%e A355475 The totient of 30 is 8, which is smaller than the totient of all larger natural numbers; since 30 has least prime signature, it is a term of this sequence.
