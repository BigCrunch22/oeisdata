%N A355728 Indices k of partition function where consecutive p(k) and p(k+1) are prime.
%C A355728 Because asymptotically the size of the partition number function p(n) is ~ O(exp(sqrt(n))), and the probability of primality of p(n) is ~ O(1/sqrt(n)) and the combined probability of primality of p(n) and p(n+1) is ~ O(1/n), the sum of the prime probabilities is diverging and there are no obvious restrictions on primality; therefore, this sequence may be conjectured to be infinite.
%C A355728 a(6) > 10^8.
%e A355728 5 is in the sequence because A000041(5) = 7 and A000041(6) = 11 are prime.
