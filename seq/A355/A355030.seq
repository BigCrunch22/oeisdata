%N A355030 a(n) is the number of possible values of the number of prime divisors (counted with multiplicity) of numbers with n divisors.
%C A355030 First differs from A305254 at n = 40, from A001055 and A252665 at n = 36, from A218320 at n = 32 and from A317791, A318559 and A326334 at n = 30.

%F A355030 a(n) <= A001055(n).
%F A355030 a(p) = 1 for p prime.
%F A355030 a(A355031(n)) = n.
%e A355030 a(2) = 1 since numbers with 2 divisors are primes, i.e., numbers k with the single value Omega(k) = 1.
%e A355030 a(4) = 2 since numbers with 4 divisors are either of the following 2 forms: p1 * p2 with p1 and p2 being distinct primes, or of the form p^3 with p prime.
%e A355030 a(8) = 3 since numbers with 8 divisors are either of the following 3 forms: p1 * p2 * p3 with p1, p2 and p3 being distinct primes, p1 * p2^3, or p1^7.
