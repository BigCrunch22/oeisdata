%N A355745 Number of ways to choose a prime factor of each prime index of n (with multiplicity, in weakly increasing order) such that the result is also weakly increasing.
%C A355745 First differs from A355741 and A355744 at n = 35.
%C A355745 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798.
%H A355745 Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product">Cartesian product</a>.
%e A355745 The prime indices of 1469 are {6,30}, and there are five valid choices: (2,2), (2,3), (2,5), (3,3), (3,5), so a(1469) = 5.
