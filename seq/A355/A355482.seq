%N A355482 a(1) = 2; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not yet appeared such that the number of 1-bits in the binary expansion of a(n) equals the number of proper divisors of a(n-1).
%C A355482 This sequence is similar to A355374 but the rules for determining a(n) are reversed. The only fixed point in the first 145 terms is a(3) = 3. It is unknown if all numbers eventually appear. The last known term is a(145) which is a 154 digit number whose complete factorization is unknown.

%e A355482 a(7) = 15 = 1111_2 as a(6) = 16 which has four proper divisors, and 15 is the smallest unused number that has four 1-bits in its binary expansion.
