%N A355680 Numerator generator for offsets from the quarter points of the Cantor ternary set to the center points of deleted middle thirds: 1 is in the list and if m is in the list -3m-4 and -3m+4 are in the list, which is ordered by absolute value.
%C A355680 At the (k+1)-th step of generating the Cantor set, the offsets from 1/4 to the center points of the deleted middle thirds are {a(i)/(4*(-3)^k) : 1 <= i <= 2^k}. Clearly, these offsets are negated for use with respect to 3/4.
%C A355680 Note that each quarter point of the Cantor ternary set, C, is also a quarter point of an interval-constrained subset of C that is an image of C scaled by 3^(-k) for all k >= 1.
%C A355680 If we replace -3m-4 and -3m+4 in the definition with -3m-2 and -3m+2 we get the terms of A191108 and their negation.

%e A355680 At the 2nd step of generating the Cantor set, the deleted middle thirds are (1/9, 2/9) and (7/9, 8/9) with center points 1/6 and 5/6. These points are offset from 1/4 by -1/12 and +7/12. The denominator for the 2nd step (i.e., k=1) is 4*(-3)^k = -12. So a(1) = -1 * -1 = 1 and a(2) = 7 * -1 = -7.
