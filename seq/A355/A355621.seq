%N A355621 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the number of terms in the first n-1 terms of the sequence that share a 1-bit with a(n-1) in their binary expansions.
%C A355621 The indices where a(n) = 1 in the first 500000 terms are 1, 2, 4, 11, 68, 131, 2051, 4099. It is unknown if more exist. Many terms of the sequence are close to the line a(n) = n although only the first term is a possible fixed point. In the first 500000 terms the lowest values not to appear are 7, 9, 14, 25, 26. It is likely these and other numbers never appear although this is unknown.

%e A355621 a(7) = 5 as a(6) = 5 and the total number of terms in the first six terms that share a 1-bit with 5 in their binary expansions is five, namely 1, 1, 1, 3, 5.
