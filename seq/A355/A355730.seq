%N A355730 Number of binary relations R on [n] such that R is contained in R^2.
%C A355730 Equivalently, a(n) is the number of binary relations R on [n] such that for all x,y in [n], if (x,y) is in R then there is a z in [n] such that (x,z) and (z,y) are both in R.  A relation having this property is sometimes called a dense relation.  Almost all relations are dense.  A relation is idempotent if and only if it is both transitive and dense.  A transitive relation is dense (hence idempotent) if and only if there does not exist a pair of irreflexive points x,y in [n] such that x covers y. Cf. Schein reference.
%C A355730 If R is contained in R^2 then the maximal cyclic nets in R are universal so that R is convergent, i.e., the period of R is equal to 1. Cf. Rosenblatt reference.  Moreover, R converges to its transitive closure so that the index of R is at most n. - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Sep 05 2023
