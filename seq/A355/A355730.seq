%N A355730 Number of binary relations R on [n] such that R is contained in R^2.
%C A355730 Equivalently, a(n) is the number of binary relations R on [n] such that for all x,y in [n], if (x,y) is in R then there is a z in [n] such that (x,z) and (z,y) are both in R.  A relation having this property is sometimes called a dense relation.  Almost all relations are dense.  A relation is idempotent if and only if it is both transitive and dense.  A transitive relation is dense (hence idempotent) if and only if there does not exist a pair of irreflexive points x,y in [n] such that x covers y. Cf. Schein reference.

%F A355730 Limit_{n->oo} a(n)/2^(n^2) = 1.
%e A355730 a(2) = 13 because all 16 binary relations on [2] are dense except for {{0,1},{0,0}}, {{0,0},{1,0}}, {{0,1},{1,0}}.
