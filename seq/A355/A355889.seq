%N A355889 Concatenate the exponents of the powers of 2 in A354169(k) in increasing order, for k = 1, 2, 3, ...
%C A355889 It is conjectured that the Hamming weight of A354169(k) is always 0, 1, or 2. This is known to be true for at least the first 2^25 terms. (The present sequence is well-defined even if the conjecture is false.)
%C A355889 So this is a far more efficient way to present A354169 than by listing the decimal expansions.
%C A355889 The terms of A354169 that are pure powers of 2 appear in order, so it is obvious how to recover A354169 from this sequence.
%C A355889 This could be regarded as a table with (presumably) two columns, and could therefore have keyword "tabf", but that is not really appropriate, since basically it consists of the nonnegative integers with some interjections.

%e A355889 A354169 begins 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 16, 32, 64, 12, 128, ... We ignore the initial 0, and then the binary expansions are 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^0+2^1, 2^4, 2^5, 2^6, 2^2+2^3, 2^7, ..., so the present sequence begins 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 7, ...
