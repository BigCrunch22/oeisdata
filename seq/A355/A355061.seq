%N A355061 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of positive numbers such that, for n>2, a(n) has a common factor with a(n-1), no common factor with a(n-2), and the product a(n)*a(n-1) is distinct from all previous products, a(i)*a(i-1), i=2..n-1.
%C A355061 Like the Enots Wolley sequence, A336957, no term a(n) can be a prime or a prime power as this would make it impossible to find a(n+1). As 6 is the smallest number to include two different primes, and hence the smallest number beyond the first two terms that can appear, it occurs frequently in the sequence, 1887 times in the first 250000 terms. See A355139 for the indices of these terms.
%C A355061 Unlike A336957 multiple odd successive terms occur, the longest such run in the first 250000 terms being fourteen starting at a(111799) = 20257.
%C A355061 See A355138 for the products of consecutive terms.

%e A355061 a(5) = 35 as this is the smallest number to share a factor with a(4) = 15, not share a factor with a(3) = 6, and contains a prime factor not in a(4) = 15 and hence allows a(6) to exist.
%e A355061 a(7) = 6 as this is the smallest number to share a factor with a(6) = 14, not share a factor with a(5) = 35, and contains a prime factor not in a(6) = 14 and hence allows a(8) to exist. This is the first term to differ from A336957.
