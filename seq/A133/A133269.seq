%N A133269 Fractal sequence consisting of quadruples, each of which contains the tones comprising a major 7th chord (i.e., root, major third, fifth, and major 7th), with the tones in an octave assigned to the numbers 1..12, and with the n-th quadruple using a(n) as its root.
%C A133269 A major 7th chord consists of its root tone and the tones that lie 4, 7, and 11 semitones (a.k.a. half tones or half steps) above the root.
%C A133269 Starting from root tones at C, C#, D, D#, E, F, etc., wrapping around the tones higher than an octave (i.e., 13->1, 14->2, etc.), and assigning numbers 1 to 12 to the half tones within the octave, the major 7th chords (4 tones each) are represented as 1-> {1, 5, 8, 12}, 2-> {2, 6, 9, 1}, 3-> {3, 7, 10, 2}, 4-> {4, 8, 11, 3}, 5-> {5, 9, 12, 4}, 6-> {6, 10, 1, 5}, 7-> {7, 11, 2, 6}, 8-> {8, 12, 3, 7}, 9-> {9, 1, 4, 8}, 10-> {10, 2, 5, 9}, 11-> {11, 3, 6, 10}, 12-> {12, 4, 7, 11}.
%C A133269 The sequence starts with the chord at root 1, which defines a(1)..a(4), and then appends iteratively in groups of 4 the chords at base a(k), k = 2, 3, 4, ... to the sequence.
%C A133269 Note that construction of a chord in terms of the intervals from its root to each of the chord's constituent notes is simpler if we instead number the notes in an octave from 0 through 11, rather than from 1 through 12 (and a sequence built this way would also have a simpler formula, not requiring us to add 1 after taking modulo-12 residues). (See the link to the Wikipedia article, which says that a major 7th chord "can be represented by the integer notation {0, 4, 7, 11}.) - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Aug 27 2017

%e A133269 If we assign the number 1 to the note C in some octave (e.g., middle C) and assign the numbers 2, 3, 4, ..., to the notes reached as we move up the scale by half tones, then the C notes at successive octaves will be assigned the numbers 1, 13, 25, ... (see the illustration below, which is intended to represent a portion of a standard musical keyboard).

%e A133269 Then the sequence consists of quadruples constructed as follows:
%e A133269 - the values of this sequence's first quadruple, a(1)..a(4) (i.e., 1, 5, 8, and 12) give a C major 7th chord (the tones C, E, G, B);
%e A133269 - the sequence's 2nd quadruple, a(5)..a(8), starts from a(5) = a(2) = 5 and thus gives an E major 7th chord (i.e., 5, 9, 12, 16, but the 16 is wrapped down an octave to 16-12 = 4);
%e A133269 - the sequence's 3rd quadruple, a(9)..a(12), starts from a(9) = a(3) = 8 and thus gives a G major 7th chord (8, 12, 15->3, 19->7);
%e A133269 - the sequence's 4th quadruple, a(13)..a(16), starts from a(13) = a(4) = 12, giving a B major 7th chord (12, 16->4, 19->7, 23->11);
%e A133269 - in general, the sequence's k-th quadruple, a(4k-3)..a(4k), starts with a(4k-3) = a(k), and its three remaining terms are a(k)+4, a(k)+7, and a(k)+11 (with any that exceed 12 decreased by 12, i.e., by one octave).
%e A133269 Thus, the sequence is fractal: keeping a(1) and every 4th term after it, and discarding the rest, yields the original sequence. (End)
