%N A133522 Smallest k such that p(n)^5 + k is prime where p(n) is the n-th prime.
%e A133522 p(2)=3, 3^5 = 243; for odd k and n > 1, p(n)^r - k is even and thus not prime, so we only need consider even k.
%e A133522 for k = 2: 243 + 2 = 245, which is 5 * 7^2 and not prime.
%e A133522 for k = 4: 243 + 4 = 247, which is 13 * 19, also not prime.
%e A133522 for k = 6: 243 + 6 = 249, which is 3 * 83, also not prime.
%e A133522 for k = 8: 243 + 8 = 251, which is prime, so 8 is the smallest number that can be added to 243 to make another prime.
%e A133522 Hence a(2) = 8.
