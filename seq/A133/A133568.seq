%N A133568 Triangle: row n is least sequence of n positive integers such that A131655(n) distinct rational numbers are generated only from them using only +, -, * and / and each number in the row no more than once in a given expression.
%C A133568 As in A131655, these operations are all considered to be the usual binary operations only; in particular, -x is not a permitted expression.
%C A133568 The list of rational numbers generated by row 5 does not contain a 1 or 0 and therefore it still might be possible to construct row 6 by using the numbers from row 5. Futhermore, one might conjecture that all subsequent rows fully contain the previous one. - _Mikelis Emils Mikelsons_, Sep 01 2021
