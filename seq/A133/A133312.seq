%N A133312 a(n) is the first pentagonal number that is nontrivially the sum of two pentagonal numbers of the type P(p) + P(p+n) (we always have P(k) = P(0) + P(k)).
%C A133312 The sequence is globally increasing with, at first sight, "unpredictible holes"; the regular values satisfy a(n) = (2523/2)*n^2 + (1189/2)*n + 70, which is approximately (35.5176013*n + 8.3690808)^2. In fact, we have to solve (6*k-1)^2 = 2*(6*p + 3*n - 1)^2 + 18*n^2 - 1 (Eq. 1) with given n that is X^2 = 2Y^2 + 18*n^2 - 1 where X = 6*k - 1 and Y = 6*p + 3*n - 1. p = 20*n + 5 and k = 29*n + 7 always give a solution of Eq. 1 but it is not certain that it is the best, i.e., the first.
%e A133312 a(0) = 70 because the first interesting relation is P(70) = P(35) + P(35), i.e., 70 = 2*35.
%e A133312 a(1) = 1926 because the first nonobvious relation is P(36) = 1926 = P(25) + P(26).
