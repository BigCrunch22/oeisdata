%N A133184 Let k'' be the result of applying the powertrain map of A133500 twice to k. Sequence gives conjectured list of all possible values of k''.
%C A133184 Sequence is believed to be finite.
%C A133184 All terms are members of A002473. Members of A002473 not present here are given in A133185. However, no proof is known that the missing numbers from A002473 (14, 21, 24, 30, ...) really are missing.
%C A133184 To settle this, one would, for example, have to prove that no number of the form 2^i*3^j*5^k*7^l exists with powertrain value 14.
%C A133184 The entries are based on a search of all numbers k such that k' = powertrain(k) <= 10^120.
