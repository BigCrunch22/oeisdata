%N A133782 Indices of monotonically increasing primes which centrally enclose the prime sequence in A133781.
%C A133782 A break occurs at index 1213 of 9833 and 89 must be centrally located at index 419 prime 2897 and the monotonic sequence resumed from that point onward until the next break occurs
%F A133782 Centrally enclose the prime sequence in another montotonically increasing prime sequence (if a break occurs begin over at that point)
%e A133782 a(23) is the index 1213 of prime 9833 where the prime 83 is centrally located.
