%N A133219 Smallest composite integer in base n which remains composite after altering any one or two digits.
%C A133219 Changing the most significant digit to 0 is allowed. The problem (base 10) was posed by W. Sierpinski, published in 1977. There are an infinite number of solutions if a certain Erdos conjecture on congruences is true. a(2) through a(9) are proved minimal, a(10) has not yet been proved minimal.
