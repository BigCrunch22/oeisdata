%N A133223 Sum of digits of primes (A007605), sorted and with duplicates removed.
%C A133223 Presumably this is 3 together with numbers greater than 1 and not divisible by 3 (see A001651). - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jul 17 2013. (This is not a theorem because we do not know if, given s > 3 and not a multiple of 3, there is always a prime with digit-sum s. Cf. A067180, A067523. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 02 2018)
%C A133223 From _Chai Wah Wu_, Nov 04 2018: (Start)
%C A133223 Conjecture: for s > 10 and not a multiple of 3, there exists a prime with digit-sum s consisting only of the digits 2 and 3 (cf. A137269). This conjecture has been verified for s <= 2995.
%C A133223 Conjecture: for s > 18 and not a multiple of 3, there exists a prime with digit-sum s consisting only of the digits 3 and 4. This conjecture has been verified for s <= 1345.
%C A133223 Conjecture: for s > 90 and not a multiple of 3, there exists a prime with digit-sum s consisting only of the digits 8 and 9. This conjecture has been verified for s <= 8995.
%C A133223 Conjecture: for 0 < a < b < 10, gcd(a, b) = 1 and ab not a multiple of 10, if s > 90 and s is not a multiple of 3, then there exists a prime with digit-sum s consisting only of the digits a and b. (End)
