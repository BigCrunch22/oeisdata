%N A133777 Number of isomorphism types of groups of order n!.
%C A133777 This sequence is interesting in view of Cayley's theorem which says that every finite group with n elements is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group S_n whose number of elements is n!. Therefore a(n) - 1 gives the number of groups "competing" with S_n in this respect. The eighth term, a(7), i.e. the number of isomorphism types of groups of order 7!=5040, seems to be unknown.

%F A133777 a(n) = A000001(n!). - _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 12 2010
%e A133777 a(0)=a(1)=1 because 0!=1!=1 and there is exactly one group of order one up to isomorphism.
%e A133777 a(2)=1 because there is exactly one group of order 2!=2, G={e,a} with a*a=e.
%e A133777 a(3)=2 because there are 2 groups of order 3!=6, namely the cyclic group Z/6Z and the nonabelian dihedral group of isometries of the triangle, generated by a rotation of 120Â° and a reflection w.r.t. an angle bisector. - _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 12 2010
