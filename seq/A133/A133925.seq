%N A133925 Number of compositions of n into parts of size 2 and 3 with no three consecutive 2s and no two consecutive 3s.
%C A133925 We give a combinatorial proof of the claimed recursion. We use the phrase "good compositions" to mean "compositions of the desired sort, i.e. into parts of size 2 or 3 with no three consecutive 2s or two consecutive 3s." Take n >= 7. Then good compositions of n and (n - 1) beginning with 3 are in bijection with good compositions of (n - 3) and (n - 4) beginning with 2 -- remove the leading 3. Good compositions of n beginning with 23 are in bijection with good compositions of (n - 5) beginning with 2 -- remove the leading 23. Good compositions of n and (n - 1) beginning with 223 are in bijection with good compositions of (n - 4) and (n - 5) beginning with 3 -- remove the leading 22. And good compositions of (n - 1) beginning with 23 are in bijection with good compositions of (n - 3) beginning with 3 -- remove the leading 2. Taken together, this gives that good compositions of n and (n - 1) are in bijection with good compositions of (n - 3), (n - 4) and (n - 5), so a(n) = -a(n - 1) + a(n - 3) + a(n - 4) + a(n - 5). A000931(n + 3) gives the number of compositions of n into parts of size 2 and 3 without any additional restrictions.

%e A133925 a(5) = 2 because we have 5 = 2 + 3 = 3 + 2. a(6) = 0 because the only ways to write 6 as a sum of 2s and 3s are 6 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 3 + 3.
