%N A133587 Conjectured order of the symmetry group of the (numerically computed) least-perimeter cluster of n nonoverlapping circles.
%C A133587 This can be thought of as the order of the symmetry group of the minimum-energy configuration of n two-dimensional bubbles in a plane. a(1) is infinite, because one bubble forms a circle, which has a continuous symmetry group containing rotations of arbitrary angles. So far, the actual symmetry groups are all dihedral, except for a(15) and a(22), which are trivial (their configurations have no symmetries).
