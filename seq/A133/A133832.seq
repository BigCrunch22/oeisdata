%N A133832 Least number k > n such that the binary trinomial 1 + 2^n + 2^k is prime, or 0 if there is no such k.
%C A133832 Conjecture: a(n) is nonzero for all n. These binary trinomials can also be written as f*2^n+1, where f=2^m+1 for some m, which is reminiscent of the Sierpinski problem (see A076336). The conjecture is equivalent to no Sierpinski numbers of the form 2^m+1 existing.
%C A133832 The PFGW program was used to find a(32), which produces a 138012-digit probable prime.
