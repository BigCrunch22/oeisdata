%N A133303 12 vertex analog of tesseract as connected octahedra graph substitution (to produce 12-note sequences).
%C A133303 This graph is like a tesseract with two connected octahedra: the idea was to get two figure with related symmetry that is 4D-like and see if they sound different. They do sound different.
