%N A133344 Complexity of the number n, counting 1's and built using +, *, ^ and # representing concatenation.
%C A133344 The complexity of an integer n is the least number of 1's needed to represent it using only additions, multiplications, exponentiation and parentheses. This allows juxtaposition of numbers to form larger integers, so for example, 2 = 1+1 has complexity 2, but unlike A003037, so does 11 = 1#1 (concatenating two numbers is an allowed operation). Similarly a(111) = 3. The complexity of a number has been defined in several different ways by different authors. See the Index to the OEIS for other definitions.
