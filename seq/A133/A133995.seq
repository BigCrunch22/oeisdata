%N A133995 Irregular array read by rows: n-th row contains (in numerical order) the positive integers <= n which are neither divisors of n nor are coprime to n. A 0 is put into row n if there are no such integers.
%C A133995 Row n has length A264441(n).
%C A133995 The number of nonzero entries in row n is A045763(n).
%C A133995 Row n has a 0 if every positive integer <= n is coprime to n or divides n.
%C A133995 From _Michael De Vlieger_, Aug 19 2017: (Start)
%C A133995 When row n is not empty (and here represented by 0), the terms of row n are composite, since primes p < n must either divide or be coprime to n and the empty product 1 both divides and is coprime to all numbers. For the following, let prime p divide n and prime q be coprime to n.
%C A133995 Row n is empty for n < 8 except n = 6.
%C A133995 There are two distinct species of term m of row n. The first are nondivisor regular numbers g in A272618(n) that divide some integer power e > 1 of n. In other words, these numbers are products of primes p that also divide n and no primes q that are coprime to n, yet g itself does not divide n. Prime powers n = p^k cannot have numbers g in A272618(n) since they have only one distinct prime divisor p; all regular numbers g = p^e with 0 <= e <= k divide p^k. The smallest n = 6 for which there is a number in A272618. The number 4 is the smallest composite and is equal to n = 4 thus must divide it; 4 is coprime to 5. The number 4 is neither coprime to nor a divisor of 6.
%C A133995 The second are numbers h in A272619(n) that are products of at least one prime p that divides n and one prime q that is coprime to n.
%C A133995 The smallest n = 8 for which there is a number in A272619 is 8; the number 6 is the product of the smallest two distinct primes. 6 divides 6 and is coprime to 7. The number 6 is neither coprime to nor a divisor of the prime power 8; 4 divides 8 and does not appear in a(8).
%C A133995 There can be no other species since primes p <= n divide n and q < n are coprime to n, and products of primes q exclusive of any p are coprime to n.
%C A133995 As a consequence of these two species, rows 1 <= n <= 5 and n = 7 are empty and thus have 0 in row n.

%e A133995 The divisors of 12 are: 1,2,3,4,6,12. The positive integers which are <= 12 and are coprime to 12 are: 1,5,7,11. So row 12 contains the positive integers <= 12 which are in neither of these two lists: 8,9,10.
