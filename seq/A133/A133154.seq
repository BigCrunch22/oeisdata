%N A133154 a(n) is the smallest m<=p-1 such that p-1 is the only value of j in 1<=j<=2p for which m^j+j==0 (mod p), where p is the n-th prime.
%C A133154 Andrew Granville, based on submitter's analysis of the data in A131685, made the following conjecture: "For some n with 1<=n<=p-1, there does not exist a value of j, with 1 <= j <= 2p, other than j=p-1, for which n^j+j == 0 (mod p)." Max Alekseyev's calculations confirm that the conjecture is true for the primes between 5 and 10^5. The sequence consists of the first such "n" (referred to as "m" in this sequence's definition) for each prime. a(n)=0 means that there is no corresponding m; this occurs at n=1 (p=2), n=2 (p=3), and n=3 (p=5), and at no other primes p<10^5.
