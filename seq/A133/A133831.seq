%N A133831 Least positive number k != n such that the binary trinomial 1 + 2^n + 2^k is prime, or 0 if there is no such k.
%C A133831 Does such k exist (so that a(n) is nonzero) for all n? These binary trinomials can also be written as f*2^n+1, where f=2^m+1 for some m, which is reminiscent of the Sierpinski problem (see A076336). Hence if there are no Sierpinski numbers of the form 2^m+1, then a(n) is nonzero for all n.
%C A133831 The PFGW program was used to find a(32), which produces a 138012-digit probable prime. If a(256) is nonzero, it is greater than 10^6.
