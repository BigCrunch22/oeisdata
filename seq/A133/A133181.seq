%N A133181 Number of distinct connected simple symmetric (edge- and vertex-transitive) graphs with n nodes.
%C A133181 Care is needed with "symmetric" terminology, which is variously used to mean both arc-transitive and both vertex- and edge-transitive.
%C A133181 The symmetry means that any two vertices and any two edges are equivalent. In other words, if we have an initial labeling of the graph with vertices A and B adjacent (directly connected by an edge), we can relabel any two adjacent vertices as A and B and then relabel the remaining vertices so that new graph will be equal to the initial.
%C A133181 The first known difference from A286280 (connected arc-transitive graphs on n vertices) occurs at a(27), corresponding to the Doyle graph (which is both edge- and vertex-transitive but not arc-transitive). - _Eric W. Weisstein_, May 13 2017
%C A133181 By convention, empty graphs are considered edge-transitive (and hence symmetric).
