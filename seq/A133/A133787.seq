%N A133787 Number of wide partitions whose first part is of size n.
%C A133787 A wide partition is a partition with the property that any sub-partition (meaning, a partition obtained by taking some of the parts) dominates its conjugate.
%C A133787 A special case of Rota's Basis Conjecture is a generalization of the Dinitz Conjecture, namely that there is a diagram - a Young Tableaux such that you see 1 through n in each row of size n and at most one of each digit in each column - if and only if the partition is wide.

%e A133787 If a wide partition has its first part of size n, then it has to fit in an n X n grid, or it itself does not dominate its conjugate. a(2) is equal to 3 because {2}, {2,1} and {2,2} are all wide partitions.
