%N A133780 Irregular array: n-th row lists the "non-isolated divisors" of (2n). A positive divisor, k, of n is non-isolated if (k-1) or (k+1) also divides n.
%C A133780 No odd integer has any non-isolated divisors. The number of terms in the n-th row of the array is A132747(2n).
%e A133780 The positive divisors of 20 are 1,2,4,5,10,20. Of these, 1 and 2 are adjacent and 4 and 5 are adjacent. So the non-isolated divisors of 20 are 1,2,4,5.
