%N A133564 a(1)=1. a(n+1) = sum{k=isolated divisors of n} a(k). An isolated divisor, k, of n is a positive divisor of n where neither (k-1) nor (k+1) divides n.
%e A133564 The positive divisors of 20 are 1,2,4,5,10,20. Of these, 1 and 2 are adjacent and 4 and 5 are adjacent. So the isolated divisors of 20 are 10 and 20. Therefore a(21) = a(10) + a(20) = 5 + 26 = 31.
