%N A133108 Representation of a dense para-sequence.
%C A133108 (1) A fractal sequence. (2) The para-sequence may be regarded as a sort of "limit" of the concatenated segments. The para-sequence (itself not a sequence) is dense in the sense that every pair of terms i and j are separated by another term (and hence separated by infinitely many terms). (3) The para-sequence accounts for positions of triadic rational numbers in the following way: 1/3 < 2/3 matches the segment 1,2; 1/9 < 2/9 < 1/3 < 4/9 < 5/9 < 2/3 < 7/9 < 8/9 matches the segment 3,4,1,5,6,2,7,8, etc.
