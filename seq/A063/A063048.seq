%N A063048 Numbers n such that the Reverse and Add! trajectory of n (presumably) does not reach a palindrome and does not join the trajectory of any term m < n.
%C A063048 The starting number n is regarded as part of the trajectory, so palindromes are excluded from the sequence. A088753 is obtained if palindromes are not excluded. The smallest term in A063048 but not in A088753 is 19098, the smallest term in A088753 but not in A063048 is 9999.
%C A063048 Subsequence of A023108. Sequence A070788 is similarly defined, but palindromes are irrelevant. Corresponding sequences for other bases are A075252 (base 2), A077405 (base 3), A075421 (base 4).
%C A063048 If the trajectory of a number k joins the trajectory of a smaller number which is a term of the present sequence, then this occurs after very few Reverse and Add! steps (at most 8 for k < 100000, at most 10 for k < 1000000). On the other hand, the trajectories of the terms < 14000 do not join the trajectory of any smaller term within at least 1500 steps. This is the precise meaning of "presumably" in the definition.
%C A063048 The terms are rather unevenly distributed. They form clusters, especially above 10^4, 10^5, 10^6, ... . The interval from 10000 to 11000 for example contains 26 terms, whereas only two terms occur in the interval from 90000 to 100000.
%C A063048 It seems that if the most significant digit is not equal to 1, the least significant digit is always 9, while this does not hold for the Lychrel numbers as in A023108. - _A.H.M. Smeets_, Feb 18 2019
%C A063048 From _A.H.M. Smeets_, Sep 18 2021: (Start)
%C A063048 Let d_0 d_1 d_2 ... d_n be the decimal digits of an (n+1)-digit number.
%C A063048 All numbers in this sequence seem to satisfy the following condition:
%C A063048 d_0 = "1" or d_n = "9", and for all k, 0 < k < floor((n-1)/2), d_k = "0" or d_k = "9" or d_(n-k) = "0" or d_(n-k) = "9".
%C A063048 The plot log_10(a(n)) versus log_10(n) shows a stepwise behavior. However, the global behavior seems to be a straight line with slope e/(e-1) (= A185393). This slope is also obtained for the seeds in the Reverse and Add! problem in other bases. (End)

%e A063048 1997 is a term since the trajectory of 1997 (presumably) does not lead to a number which occurs in the trajectory of 196 or of 879 (actually checked for the first 10000 terms of these trajectories). The trajectory of 1997 joins the trajectory of 106 at 97768 (cf. A070796), but 106 is not a term of the present sequence.
