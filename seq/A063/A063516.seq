%N A063516 Multiples of single electron masses yielding stable particles intermediate between an electron and a proton as given in reference below.
%C A063516 1 is duplicated to allow for the addition of a positron to the sequence and 128 is also duplicated since the geometries involved give a meta and para form of the 128 electron mass particle.
