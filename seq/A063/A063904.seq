%N A063904 a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3 and a(k+1) is the least prime not already chosen that divides some a(i)*a(j)+1, where 1<=i<j<=k.
%C A063904 "Does the sequence [above] contain every prime? Is the sequence infinite?" ... "The sequence of problem [above] is not even known to be infinite, though it almost surely contains every prime. We do not know whether anyone has attacked the problem computationally; perhaps you, the reader, would like to give it a try. The problem is due to M. Newman at the Australian Nation University." - Crandall and Pomerance
%C A063904 Indices of primes in this sequence: 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, ..., . It appears that only the primes 7 and 19 are out of order in the first 1000. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Apr 12 2006 [corrected by _Sergey Pavlov_, Apr 26 2017]
%C A063904 No more out-of-order primes up to 100 billion. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Apr 26 2010.
