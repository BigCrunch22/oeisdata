%N A063884 a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3 and a(k+1) is the least prime not already chosen that divides some a(i)*a(j)+1, where 1<=i<=j<=k.
%C A063884 "Does the sequence [above] contain every prime? Is the sequence infinite?" ... "The sequence of problem [above] is not even known to be infinite, though it almost surely contains every prime. We do not know whether anyone has attacked the problem computationally; perhaps you, the reader, would like to give it a try. The problem is due to M. Newman at the Australian Nation University." - Crandall and Pomerance
%C A063884 No more out-of-order primes up to 100 billion. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Apr 26 2010.

%e A063884 a(3) is equal to 5 because a(1)*a(1)+1 = 2*2+1 = 5.
