%N A063837 Divisibility tournaments with odd determinants.
%C A063837 Let n be a positive integer, n>3. Define a tournament on the vertex set {2,3,...n} by: for i< j, i is adjacent to j if i divides j, else, j is adjacent to i and let T(n) be its adjacency matrix. It appears that values of n for which det(T(n)) is odd are rather sparse. Shown above are the n in the range 4...130 for which det(T(n)) is odd.
