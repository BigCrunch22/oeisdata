%e A122669 a(15)=1 because primes between 15 and 30 are {17, 19, 23, 29} and {17, 23, 29} is an arithmetic progression.
%e A122669 a(27)=a(28)=a(29)=3 because {29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53} includes {29, 41, 53}, {31, 37, 43}, {41, 47, 53}.
%e A122669 a(30)=4 because {31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59} includes {31, 37, 43}, {41, 47, 53}, {47, 53, 59}, {41, 47, 53,
