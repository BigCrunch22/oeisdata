%N A122224 Length of the longest possible self avoiding path on the 2-dimensional square lattice such that the path fits into a circle of diameter n.
%C A122224 The path may be open or closed. For larger n several solutions with the same number of segments exist.
%C A122224 It is conjectured that a(n) >= A123690(n)-1, i.e., that it is always possible to find a path visiting all grid points covered by a circle, irrespective of the position of its center. - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Mar 02 2018
