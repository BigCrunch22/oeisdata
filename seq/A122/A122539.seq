%N A122539 Number of benzenoids with 21 hexagons with D_(2h) symmetry and 60+2n carbons.
%C A122539 The total number of carbons in 21 free hexagons is 6*21=126, but since they have to be attached (form overlapping molecules sharing edges) the sequence ends already at compounds with 86 carbons. - _R. J. Mathar_, May 02 2008

%e A122539 For n=10, there are 16 different forms of C_70H_30 of benzenoids of 21 hexagons attached along at least one edge, which each have D_(2h) planar symmetry.
