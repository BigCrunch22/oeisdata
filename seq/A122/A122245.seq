%C A122245 Questions: to which Wolfram's class does this simple program belong, class 3 or class 4? (Is that classification applicable here? This is not 1D CA, although it may look like one).
%C A122245 Does the "central skyscraper" continue widening forever? (see the image for up to 16384th generation) At what specific points it widens? (A new sequence for that). How does that differ from A122242 and similar sister sequences, with different starting conditions?
