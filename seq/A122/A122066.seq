%N A122066 a(0)=1. a(n) = the number of earlier terms equal to GCD(a(k),n), where a(k) is the largest term among terms a(0) through a(n-1).
%e A122066 The largest term among terms a(0) through a(9) is a(6)=4. GCD(4,10)=2. So a(10) is the number of earlier terms equal to 2. a(2) =a(3) =a(4) =a(5) =a(7) =2. So a(10) = 5.
