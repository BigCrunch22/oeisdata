%N A122844 Triangle read by rows: T[n,k] = the number of ascending runs of length at least k in the permutations of [n] for k <= n.
%C A122844 Column T[n,1] is essentially A001710 - all ascending runs in permutations of [n] Column T[n,2] is A006157 - ascending runs of length at least 2 in permutations of [n] Column T[n,3] is A005460 - ascending runs of length at least 3 in permutations of [n]
%F A122844 T[n,k] = n![k(n-k+1)+1]/(k+1)! for 0<k<=n; T[n,k] = Sum_{j=k..n}A122843(n,j) (partial row sums of A122843)
%e A122844 1
%e A122844 3 1
%e A122844 12 5 1 ; there are 5 ascending runs of length at least 2 in the permutations of [3], namely 13 in 132 and in 213, 23 in 231, 12 in 312, 123 in 123. T[3,2] = 5.
