%N A122787 a(n) is the smallest prime p such that the multiplicative order of 10 modulo p is 3^n.
%C A122787 For n>0, a(n) is the smallest prime p>3 such that 3^n*p but not 3^(n-1)*p is a solution to 10^x==1 (mod x). A014950 gives solutions of this equation. It's obvious that if n is a term of A014950 then 3n is also a term of A014950. So according to the definition of a(n), for each m>n-1, 3^m*a(n) is in the sequence A014950.
%C A122787 a(n) is the smallest prime divisor of \Phi_{3^n}(10)/3, where \Phi_k(x) is k-th cyclotomic polynomial. a(n) is congruent to 1 modulo 3^n and 1, 3, 9, 13, 27, 31, 37, or 39 modulo 40. - _Max Alekseyev_, Nov 18 2014
