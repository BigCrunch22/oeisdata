%N A122989 Decimal expansion of Sum_{n >= 1} 1/A007504(n), where A007504(n) is the sum of the first n primes.
%C A122989 Summing k=4016708412 primes, I get prime(k)=97434417233, primeSum=191462469311735988657, seriesSum=1.02347632390000000000618+. And I compute an upper bound of 1.02347632395-. - _Don Reble_, May 14 2007

%E A122989 A number of contributors worked on the difficult question of computing this constant accurately. The above comment from _Don Reble_ gives the tightest bounds presently known. It had been suggested that the true value might be Pi/6 + 1/2 = 1.0235987755982988730771..., but that is now disproved. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jun 15 2007
