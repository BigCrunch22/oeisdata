%N A122059 Number of different polygonal knots with n straight line segments.
%C A122059 A spatial polygon is a finite set of straight line segments in R3 which intersect only at their endpoints; the lines are called edges and their endpoints are called vertices; exactly two edges meet at every vertex. There must be at least 3 edges to make a triangle (the trivial knot) and it is not hard to show that a knotted polygon must have at least 6 edges. "Enumerating these polygons soon becomes impracticable because the number of cases explodes as n increases."
%C A122059 Hong et al. prove: "The lattice stick number s_L(K) of a knot K is defined to be the minimal number of straight line segments required to construct a stick presentation of K in the cubic lattice. In this paper, we find an upper bound on the lattice stick number of a nontrivial knot K, except trefoil knot, in terms of the minimal crossing number c(K) which is s_L(K) <= 3 c(K) + 2. Moreover if K is a non-alternating prime knot, then s_L(K) <= 3 c(K) - 4". - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Sep 04 2012

%e A122059 a(3) = 1 because the unique polygonal knot of 3 edges can be drawn with vertex coordinates (4,9,5), (7,-9,5), (-9,-3,5).
%e A122059 a(6) = 1 because the unique polygonal knot of 6 edges can be drawn with vertex coordinates (4,9,5), (-7,-7,-5), (7,-9,5), (-1,9,-5), (-9,-3,5), (9,-5,-5).
%e A122059 a(7) = 1 because the unique polygonal knot of 7 edges can be drawn with vertex coordinates (9,-6,3), (-4,-7,3), (1,7,2), (-9,2,-10), (4,-5,10), (2,2,-2), (-5,2,5).
