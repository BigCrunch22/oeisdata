%N A122270 Numbers m such that the numerator of the Bernoulli number B(m) is divisible by a cube.
%C A122270 For each m in the current sequence, the smallest prime whose cube divides the numerator of the Bernoulli number B(m) is listed in A122271.
%C A122270 The current sequence is a subset of A090997, which are numbers m such that the numerator of the Bernoulli number B(m) is divisible by a square.
%C A122270 A subset of the current sequence is A122272, which are numbers m such that the numerator of the Bernoulli number B(m) is divisible by a fourth power.
%C A122270 Conjecture: For all regular primes p > 3 and integers k > 0, the numerator of the Bernoulli number B(2*p^k) is divisible by p^k. Moreover, for all regular primes p > 3 and integers k > 0, m = 2*p^k is the smallest index such that the numerator of the Bernoulli number B(m) is divisible by p^k. Also, for all regular primes p > 3 and integers k > 0, all m such that the numerator of the Bernoulli number B(m) is divisible by p^k are of the form m = 2*s*p^k, where s > 0 is an integer.

%e A122270 a(1) = 250 because it is the smallest number m such that numerator(B(m)) == 0 (mod 5^3). Note that 250 = 2*5^3.
%e A122270 a(2) = 686 because it is the smallest number m such that numerator(B(m)) == 0 (mod 7^3). Note that 686 = 2*7^3.
