%N A122165 Continued fraction expansion of constant x = Sum_{n>=0} 1/5^(2^n).
%C A122165 Consists entirely of 3's, 5's and 7's, after an initial partial quotient of 4. These partial quotients are aperiodic.

%e A122165 Decimal expansion (A078886) consists of large gaps of zeros between strings of digits that form powers of 2; this can be seen by grouping the digits as follows:
%e A122165 x = .2 4 16 0 256 000 65536 000000 4294967296 000000000000 ...
%e A122165 and then recognizing the substrings as powers of 2:
%e A122165 2 = 2^(2^0), 4 = 2^(2^1), 16 = 2^(2^2), 65536 = 2^(2^4),
%e A122165 4294967296 = 2^(2^5), 18446744073709551616 = 2^(2^6), ...
