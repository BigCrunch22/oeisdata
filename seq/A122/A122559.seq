%N A122559 Position of first letter of n-th planet (in English) in alphabet.
%C A122559 M, V, E, M, J, S, U and N are the first letters of each of the 8 Planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) in the Solar System in order from the sun. Due to a resolution by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) on August 24 2006, Pluto is no longer considered a planet but a 'dwarf planet'(term which resolution makes clearly distinct from that of "planet"). The definition currently applies only to the Sun's solar system and to the English language.
