%N A122272 Numbers m such that the numerator of the Bernoulli number B(m) is divisible by p^4, where p is prime.
%C A122272 For each m in the current sequence, the smallest prime p such that p^4 divides the numerator of the Bernoulli number B(m) is listed in A122273.
%C A122272 Note that the numerator of B(6250) is divisible by 5^5.
%C A122272 The current sequence is a subsequence of A122270, which are the numbers m such that the numerator of the Bernoulli number B(m) is divisible by a cube.
%C A122272 Sequence A122270 itself is a subsequence of A090997, which are the numbers m such that the numerator of the Bernoulli number B(m) is divisible by a square. [Edited by _Petros Hadjicostas_, May 12 2020]

%e A122272 a(1) = 1250 because 5^4 divides numerator(B(1250)).
%e A122272 a(3) = 4802 because 7^4 divides numerator(B(4802)).
