%N A122783 Nonprimes k > 0 such that 6^k==6 (mod k).
%C A122783 Theorem: If both numbers q and 2q-1 are primes then n=q*(2q-1) is in the sequence iff q<5 or q is of the form 12k+1. 6,15,2701,18721,49141,104653,226801,665281,... are such terms.

%e A122783 1 is a term since 6^1 = 6 is congruent to 6 mod 1.
%e A122783 2 is not a term since although 6^2 === 6 (mod 2), 2 IS a prime.
%e A122783 4 is not a term since 6^4 = 1296 == 0 mod 4, while 6 == 2 (mod 4).
%e A122783 6 is a term since 6^6 = 46656 == 0 (mod 6), and 6 == 0 (mod 6).
%e A122783 10 is a term because 6^10 = 60466176 == 6 (mod 10)
