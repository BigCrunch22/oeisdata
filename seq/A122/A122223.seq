%N A122223 Length of the longest possible self avoiding path on the 2-dimensional honeycomb net such that the path fits into a circle of diameter n.
%C A122223 The path may be open or closed. For larger n several solutions with the same number of segments exist. An upper bound for the number of segments is given by A127406(n).
