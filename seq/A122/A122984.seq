%N A122984 Smallest positive composite number, relatively prime to n, such that a(n)+n is also composite.
%C A122984 Does not include every composite number; in particular, 12 is not present. If a(n) = 12, gcd(n,12) = 1, but then one of n+4 and n+8 is divisible by 3.
%Y A122984 Equals A122985(n) - n. Cf. A096076.
