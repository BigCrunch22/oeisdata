%N A122916 Minimum number of n-candidate full-rank-order ballots required to instantiate any tournament on n nodes (where A beats B in the tournament if and only if it does so in a majority of the ballots and we forbid pairwise ties).
%C A122916 Every entry is an odd number. a(n) <= a(n+1) <= a(n)+4. For all large enough n we know Cn/log(n) < a(n) < Kn/log(n) for suitable constants 0<C<K. Additional entries should be within the reach of computers. a(19) >= 5.

Warning: Erdos, Moser and Stearns actually consider a slightly different problem definition, where ties are allowed. That would define a different sequence which would upper-bound this one and is related to it, but the present sequence seems to be a little more pleasant.
