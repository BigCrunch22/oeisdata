%N A122556 Primes occur infinitely often, with first appearance in order. Between each occurrence of a prime p, there are p distinct primes.
%C A122556 From a suggestion by _Eric Angelini_. The primes between two occurrences of p always include all smaller primes, often more than once and p - PrimePi(p) + 1 larger primes, once each. (Here PrimePi is A000720, the number of primes <= n.)
%e A122556 Between the first and 2nd 5's, the sequence is 2,7,3,2,11,13,2,3; the distinct values are {2,3,7,11,13}, a set with 5 elements.
%Y A122556 Cf. A000720, A001511.
