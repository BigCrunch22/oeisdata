%N A122484 Numbers n not ending in zero such that the sum of digits of n is >= the sum of digits of n^4 (in base 10).
%C A122484 I've also found 498998999999, 7494994999999, 34999974999999 and some larger numbers, but not all values in between have been checked.
%C A122484 One is likely to find an example of the form 5*10^n-m*10^floor[n/2]-1 or 7.5*10^n-m*10^floor[n/2]-1 for n>12 within the first 10^(floor[n/2]-1) m's.
%C A122484 Is this sequence finite? - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jan 12 2012
%C A122484 This sequence is infinite: for N=7.5*10^n-40*10^[n/2]-1 one has A007953(N)=9n-2 and A007953(N^4) <= 9n-2 for all n>16, with equality for all even n>16. - M. F. Hasler, Jan 14 2012
%F A122484 A122484 = { n in A067251 | A007953(n) >= A007953(n^4) }. - M. F. Hasler, Jan 14 2012
%e A122484 67 is in the list because 67 has a digital sum of 13 and 67^4 = 20151121 which also has a digital sum of 13.
%e A122484 594959999 has a digital sum of 68 and 594959999^4 has a digital sum of 67, i.e. less than 68.
