%N A122484 Numbers k not ending in zero such that the sum of digits of k is >= the sum of digits of k^4 (in base 10).
%C A122484 I've also found 498998999999, 7494994999999, 34999974999999 and some larger numbers, but not all values in between have been checked.
%C A122484 One is likely to find an example of the form 5*10^j - m*10^floor(j/2) - 1 or 7.5*10^j - m*10^floor(j/2) - 1 for j > 12 within the first 10^(floor(j/2)-1) m's.
%C A122484 Is this sequence finite? - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jan 12 2012
%C A122484 This sequence is infinite: for N = 7.5*10^j - 40*10^floor(j/2) - 1 one has A007953(N) = 9j-2 and A007953(N^4) <= 9j-2 for all j > 16, with equality for all even j > 16. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 14 2012
