%N A122213 a(n) = (sum of the divisors of n)th integer from among those positive integers which are coprime to n.
%e A122213 8 = 1 + 7 is the sum of the divisors of 7. 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,16,... are the positive integers
%e A122213 which are coprime to 7. Of these integers, 9 is the 8th. So a(7) = 9.
