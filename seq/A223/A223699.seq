%N A223699 Least number whose Collatz (3x+1) iteration has its maximum value at position n (counting from 1).
%C A223699 The maximum values are in A223700.

%e A223699 The Collatz iteration of 15 is {15, 46, 23, 70, 35, 106, 53, 160, 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1}. The maximum is 160, which occurs at position 11, counting from the right. Hence, a(11) = 15 because no number smaller than 15 has its maximum value at the 11 position.
%t A223699 Collatz[n_] := NestWhileList[If[EvenQ[#], #/2, 3 # + 1] &, n, # > 1 &]; t= Table[c = Reverse[Collatz[n]]; Position[c, Max[c]][[1, 1]], {n, 10000}]; t2 = {}; n = 0; While[n++; p = Position[t, n, 1, 1]; p != {}, AppendTo[t2, p[[1,1]]]]; t2
