%N A223727 Numbers which are a sum of four distinct nonzero squares where the  summands have no common factor > 1.
%C A223727 A primitive representation of a number m as a sum of four distinct nonzero squares is determined from a quadruple [s(1), s(2), s(3), s(4)] of integers with 0 < s(1) < s(2) < s(3) < s(4) with gcd(s(1),s(2),s(3),s(4)) = 1, and m = sum(s(j)^2, j=1..4). If m has such a primitive representation then k^2*m, with integer k > 0, has trivially a non-primitive representation. Therefore primitive representations are of interest.
%C A223727 For the multiplicities see A223728.
%C A223727 This sequence is a proper subset of A004433. The first entry of A004433 missing here is 120 = A004433(43). The first common entry with different multiplicity is A004433(72) = 156 = a(71) with two primitive representations with quadruples
%C A223727 [1, 3, 5, 11] and [1, 5, 7, 9]. [2, 4, 6, 10] = 2*[1, 2, 3, 5]is a non-primitive representation due to 156 = 4*39.
%F A223727 This sequence are the increasingly ordered members of the set {m an integer | m = sum(s(j)^2, j=1..4), with 0 < s(1) < s(2) < s(3) < s(4) and gcd(s(1),s(2),s(3),s(4)) = 1}.
%e A223727 a(1) = 30 because the numbers 0,...,29 have no representation as a sum of four distinct nonzero squares, and 30 has one representation given by the quadruple [1,2,3,4] which is primitive.
%e A223727 a(16) = 78 has three such representations given by the quadruples  [1, 2, 3, 8], [1, 4, 5, 6] and [2, 3, 4, 7] which are all primitive. Hence A223728(16) = 3. This is the first entry with more than one (primitive) representation.
%e A223727 a(23) = 90 has multiplicity 2 = A223728 because there are two primitive quadruples [1, 2, 6, 7] and [1, 3, 4, 8].
%e A223727 a(71) = 156 has multiplicity A223728(71) = 2 (see a comment above).
