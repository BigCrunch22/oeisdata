%N A223734 Positive numbers that are the sum of three nonzero squares with no common factor > 1 in exactly three ways.
%C A223734 These are the increasingly ordered numbers a(n) for which A223730(a(n)) = 3. See also A223731. These are the numbers n with exactly three representation as a primitive sum of three nonzero squares (not taking into account the order of the three terms, and the number to be squared for each term is taken positive).
%C A223734 Conjecture: a(185) = 4075 = 31^2 + 33^2 + 45^2 = 23^2 + 39^2 + 45^2 = 5^2 + 9^2 + 63^2 is the largest element of this sequence. - _Alois P. Heinz_, Apr 06 2013

%F A223734 This sequence lists the increasingly ordered distinct members of the set S3:= {m positive integer | m = a^2 + b^2 + c^2, 0 < a <= b <= c, and there are exactly three different solutions for this m}.
%e A223734 a(1) = 66 because the smallest number n with A223730(n) = 3 is 66. The three solutions for m = 66 are denoted by [1,1,8], [1,4,7] and [4,5,5].
