%N A223730 Multiplicities for representations of positive numbers n as primitive sums of three nonzero squares.
%C A223730 Primitive sums of three nonzero squares a^2 + b^2 + c^2, with positive integers a, b and c, satisfy gcd(a,b,c) = 1. (coprimality of the three squares).
%C A223730 a(n) gives the number of different representations (multiplicities) of the number n >= 1 as primitive sums of three nonzero squares. If a(n) = 0 there is no such representation for n. The numbers n with a(n) not vanishing are given in A223731. The ones with a(n) = 1, 2 and 3 are in A223732, A223733 and A223734, respectively.
%C A223730 For the multiplicities of the positive numbers as sums of three nonzero squares see A025427. The numbers with A025427(n) >= 1 are given in A000408.
%C A223730 A corollary in the Halter-Koch reference (Korollar 1. (b) on p. 13) states for the positive numbers n, not 0, 4, 7 (mod 8) [otherwise n cannot be a primitive sum of three nonzero squares; see p. 11, the r_3(n) formula]:  n is not the sum of three positive coprime squares if and only if n is from the set T := {1, 2, 5, 10, 13, 25, 37, 58, 85, 130, ?}, with ? possibly a number >= 5*10^10 . Therefore a(n) = 0 if and only if n >= 1 is of the form mentioned in this corollary: i)  0, 4, 7 (mod 8) or ii) in the set T.
%C A223730 For representations of n as a sum of three nonzero squares see the Grosswald reference, Theorem 7, p. 79. There also the above mentioned set T appears and for the Conjecture it is assumed that the extra eleventh member of T is absent.

%F A223730 a(n) = 0 if there is no representation of n as a primitive sum of three nonzero squares. a(n) = k >= 1 if there are k distinct such representations for n.
%e A223730 a(12) = 0 because the only representation of 12 as a sum of three nonzero squares is given by [2,2,2], i.e., 12 = 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2, but this is not a primitive sum because gcd(2,2,2) = 2, not 1. Such a situation appears for n = 12, 24, 36, 44, 48, 56, 68, 72, 76, 84, 88, 96, ... For these numbers A025427(n) = 1 and a(n) = 0.
%e A223730 a(27) = 1 because the only primitive representation of 27 as a sum of three nonzero squares is denoted by [1,1,5]. The representation [3,3,3] is not primitive.
