%N A080532 Number of nucleons in longest known radioactive decay series ending with Lead 209, reversed.
%C A080532 The numbers are all == 1 mod 4. The sequence was submitted reversed, as it is open in the past. It is unknown if reversed decay series are finite (the "island of stability" hypothesis).
