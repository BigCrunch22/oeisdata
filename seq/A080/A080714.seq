%N A080714 a(n) is taken to be the (n-th)-smallest positive integer greater than a(n-1) that is consistent with the condition "n is a member of the sequence if and only if a(n) is odd.".

%e A080714 a(2) cannot be 2 because that would require the second term to be odd, a condition 2 does not satisfy. Since 2 is therefore not in the sequence, the second term must be even. The second-smallest even number greater than 2 is 6; therefore a(2) is 6.
