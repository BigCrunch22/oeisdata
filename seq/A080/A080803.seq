%N A080803 Number of vertices of minimal graph with an automorphism group of order n.
%C A080803 Most terms were found in the thread "Automorphismengruppen von Graphen" in the German newsgroup "de.sci.mathematik" (mostly by Hauke Klein). The terms a(9)=15, a(15)=21, a(21)=23, a(27)=24, a(30)=14 still need verification.
%C A080803 The value A080803(21) = 21 is due to _Gordon Royle_, who found a graph with 21 vertices whose automorphism group is non-Abelian of order 21 (a 2'-Hall subgroup of the group PSL_2(7)).

%e A080803 a(4)=4 because the graph with 4 vertices and exactly one edge has an automorphism group of order 4 and no smaller graph has exactly 4 automorphisms.
