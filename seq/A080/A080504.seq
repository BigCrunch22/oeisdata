%N A080504 Triangle whose n-th row contains the least set (ordered lexicographically) of n distinct positive integers whose arithmetic and geometric means are both integers.
%C A080504 Row n has the form {1,2,...,n-2,x,y} where n-1 <= x < y. x is minimal such that y exists.
%e A080504 The fourth row contains 1,2,5,1000, with AM=252 and GM=10. There is no set of the form {1,2,3,y} or {1,2,4,y} whose AM and GM are both integers.
