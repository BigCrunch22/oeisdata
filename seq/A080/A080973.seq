%N A080973 A014486-encoding of the "Moose trees".
%C A080973 Meeussen's observation about the orbits of a composition of two involutions F and R states that if the orbit size of the composition (acting on a particular element of the set) is odd, then it contains an element fixed by the other involution if and only if it contains also an element fixed by the other, on the (almost) opposite side of the cycle. Here those two involutions are A057163 and A057164, their composition is Donaghey's "Map M" A057505 and as the trees A080293/A080295 are symmetric as binary trees and the cycle sizes A080292 are odd, it follows that these are symmetric as general trees.
