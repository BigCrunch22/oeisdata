%N A080427 a(1)=1 and, for n>1, a(n) is the smallest positive integer such that the absolute difference |a(n)-a(n-1)| has not occurred previously.
%C A080427 It appears (1) that a(3n+2)=1 for n=1,2,3,... and (2) that the sequence {a(3n+3)-a(3n)}={3,2,2,3,3,2,3,2,3,2,2,3,3,2,2,3,3,2,...} consists only of 2's and 3's and that the sequence of the lengths of runs of consecutive 3's in {a(3n+3)-a(3n)} is given by {1,2,1,1,2,2,2,1,...}=A026465.
