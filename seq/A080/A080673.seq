%N A080673 Largest number with exactly n representations as sum of five positive squares (or 0 if no number with exactly n representations exists).
%C A080673 a(0) = 33 has been asked as a riddle by Gerhard Woeginger in de.rec.denksport.
%C A080673 There is no number <= 10^6 that is the sum of five positive squares in exactly 188 ways. - _Donovan Johnson_, Aug 15 2013
%C A080673 Donovan Johnson's exhaustive search in fact shows that a(188) is undefined / should be assigned the default value 0. _Hagen von Eitzen_, Jun 05 2014
%C A080673 In what sense the search is exhaustive? Is any of the  0's of the b-file proved? - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 27 2017

%F A080673 a(n) = max { k | A025429(k) = n }. - _M. F. Hasler_, May 30 2014
%e A080673 A known result says a(0) = 33, since there is no representation of 33 as sum of 5 positive squares.
%e A080673 a(1) = 60 is the largest number allowing exactly one such representation.
