%N A080191 Primes p such that p is the largest of all prime factors of the numbers between the prime preceding 2*p and the next prime.
%C A080191 Complement of A080192 relative to A000040.
%C A080191 From _Fl√°vio V. Fernandes_, May 26 2021: (Start)
%C A080191 Equivalently, primes p such that p is the largest of all prime factors of the numbers in the interval [2*p, nextprime(2*p)-1].
%C A080191 For any prime p, if p is not the largest of all prime factors of the numbers in that interval (i.e., if p is not a term of this sequence), then the largest of all prime factors of the numbers in that interval will be a prime q that occurs in the number 2*q.
%C A080191 For all n, the largest prime < 2*a(n) is a term of A059788. (End)

%F A080191 f(precprime(2*p)) = p, where f is the mapping defined by A052248.
%e A080191 5 is a term since 7 is the prime preceding 2*5, 11 is the next prime and 5 is the largest of all prime factors of 8, 9 and 10.
