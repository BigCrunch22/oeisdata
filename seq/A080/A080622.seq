%N A080622 Consider 3 X 3 X 3 Rubik cube, but only allow the slice group to act; sequence gives number of positions that are exactly n moves from the start, up to equivalence under the full group of order 48 of the cube.
%C A080622 Not every position can be reached using this restricted set of moves. Number of inequivalent positions that can be reached = 50.
