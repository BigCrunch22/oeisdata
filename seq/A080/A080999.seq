%N A080999 Centrality of A080997(n) = a(n)/(A080997(n))^2.
%C A080999 A permutation of sequence A018804, which gives the sum of gcd (k,n) for 1 <= k <= n.
%F A080999 The multiplicative formula for the numerator in a positive integer's centrality fraction is: for prime p, a(p^e)= p^(e-1)*((p-1)e+p) (cf. A018804). Dividing by the square of the integer gives the integer's centrality, which is defined to be the average fraction of the integer that it shares with the other integers as a gcd; see A080997 for other interpretations. This sequence gives the unreduced centrality numerators for A080997(n), where A080997 is the sequence of positive integers in nonincreasing order of their centrality.
%Y A080999 Cf. A080997, A080998 for centrality rankings of the positive integers.
