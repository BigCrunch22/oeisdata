%N A080594 Consider the standard game of Nim with 3 heaps and make a list of the losing positions (x,y,z) with x <= y <= z in reverse lexicographic order; sequence gives y values.
%C A080594 (x,y,z) is a losing position iff the mod-2 sum of the binary expansions of x,y,z (without carries) is 0.
%C A080594 In this sort the first few triples are: 0 0 0, 0 1 1, 0 2 2, 1 2 3, 0 3 3, 0 4 4, 1 4 5, 0 5 5, 2 4 6, 3 5 6, 0 6 6, 3 4 7, 2 5 7, 1 6 7, 0 7 7, 0 8 8, 1 8 9, 0 9 9, 2 8 10, 3 9 10, 0 10 10, 3 8 11, 2 9 11, 1 10 11, 0 11 11, 4 8 12, 5 9 12, 6 10 12, 7 11 12, 0 12 12. The 0,0,0 triple was added by Joshua Zucker.
