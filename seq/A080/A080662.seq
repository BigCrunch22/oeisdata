%N A080662 Order of group of n X n X n Rubik cube, under assumptions s, not-m, i.
%C A080662 The three possible assumptions considered here are the following:
%C A080662 s (for n odd) indicates that we are working in the "supergroup" and so take account of twists of the face centers.
%C A080662 m (for n > 3) indicates that the pieces are marked so that we take account of the permutation of the identically-colored pieces on a face.
%C A080662 i (for n > 3) indicates that we are working in the theoretical invisible group and solve the pieces on the interior of the cube as well as the exterior. It is assumed that the M and S traits apply to the interior pieces as if they were on the exterior of a smaller cube.
