%N A080529 Number of nucleons in longest known radioactive decay series ending with Lead 206 ("uranium series"), reversed.
%C A080529 The numbers are all equivalent to 2 mod 4. The sequence was submitted reversed, as it is open in the past. It is unknown if reversed decay series are finite (the "island of stability" hypothesis).
