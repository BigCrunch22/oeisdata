%N A080279 Numbers n such that 1/G^n is closer to its nearest integer than any value of 1/G^k for 1 <= k < n, where G is Catalan's constant.
%C A080279 At n=2189 the discrepancy is 0.00000715379617...
%e A080279 First term is 1 because this is just 1/G=1.0917440637... Second term is 8 because 1/G^8=2.01821167... which is 0.0182... away from its nearest integer. 1/G^52 is 0.0027 away from 96.
