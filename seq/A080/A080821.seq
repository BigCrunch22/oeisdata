%N A080821 Primes in the accumulated tally of steps in the x+1 problem: Repeat until 1 is reached: if x is even divide by 2, otherwise add 1.
%C A080821 Sum of reciprocals for the x+1 problem is around 0.318.
%C A080821 Sum of reciprocals for the 3x+1 problem is around 0.1116.
%C A080821 The number of steps for the x+1 problem starting at n is A061313(n). The partial sums of A061313 are the sequence 0, 1, 4, 6, 11, 15, 19, 22, 29, 35, 41, ... Selecting the primes from these builds the current sequence. - _R. J. Mathar_, Feb 01 2008
