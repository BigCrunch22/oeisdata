%N A080839 Number of increasing integer sequences of length n with Gilbreath transform (that is, the diagonal of leading successive absolute differences) given by {1,1,1,1,1,...}.
%C A080839 The slowest-growing sequence of length n is 1,2,4,6,...,2(n-1). The fastest-growing sequence is 1,2,4,8,...,2^(n-1). The ratio a(n+1)a(n-1)/a(n)^2 appears to converge to a constant near 1.46, which is the approximate growth rate of A001609. Are the sequences related? - _T. D. Noe_, Feb 05 2007
%e A080839 The table below shows that {1,2,4,6,10} is one of the 6 sequences of length 5 that satisfy the stated condition:
%e A080839 1
%e A080839 2 1
%e A080839 4 2 1
%e A080839 6 2 0 1

%Y A080839 Cf. A036262.
%Y A080839 Cf. A136465, the total number of increasing sequences with the same maximum length. [From _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Aug 08 2010]
