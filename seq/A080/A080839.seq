%N A080839 Number of positive increasing integer sequences of length n with Gilbreath transform (that is, the diagonal of leading successive absolute differences) given by {1,1,1,1,1,...}.
%C A080839 From _T. D. Noe_, Feb 05 2007: (Start)
%C A080839 The slowest-growing sequence of length n is 1,2,4,6,...,2(n-1). The fastest-growing sequence is 1,2,4,8,...,2^(n-1).
%C A080839 The ratio a(n+1)a(n-1)/a(n)^2 appears to converge to a constant near 1.46, which is the approximate growth rate of A001609. Are the sequences related?
%C A080839 (End)
%C A080839 Also, a(n) is the number of (not necessarily increasing) positive integer sequences of length n-1 with Gilbreath transform (1, ..., 1). - _Pontus von Br√∂mssen_, May 13 2023
