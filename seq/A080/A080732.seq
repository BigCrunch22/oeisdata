%Y A080732 There are four different sequences which may legitimately be called "prime powers": A000961 (p^k, k >= 0), A246655 (p^k, k >= 1), A246547 (p^k, k >= 2), A025475 (p^k, k=0 and k >= 2). When you refer to "prime powers", be sure to specify which of these you mean. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 24 2018
