%N A080377 Each a(n) is a difference of suitable consecutive primes, a(n)=Prime[1+A080376(n)]-Prime[A080376(n)]. a(n+1) is the smallest prime-difference [from A001223] which has prime-factor not present in previous terms or was present but at lower power.
%e A080377 18 is the 7th term:in first-6th ones {2,4,6,8,14,10} 3 does not occur with power 2 unlike in 18; 22 is the 8th term: in first-7th terms 11 is not a prime factor unlike 22. several even numbers do not arise in this sequence, e.g.:12,20,36,48, etc..
