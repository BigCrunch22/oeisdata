%N A080968 Orbit size of each branch-reduced tree encoded by A080981(n) under Donaghey's "Map M" Catalan automorphism.
%C A080968 This is the size of the cycle containing A080980(n) in the permutations A057505/A057506.
%C A080968 If the conjecture given in A080070 is true, then this sequence contains only six 2's. Questions: are there any (other) values with finite number of occurrences? Which primes will eventually appear?
