%N A080024 Number of divisors d of n such that in binary representation d and n/d have the same number of 1's as n.
%C A080024 a(n)<=A000005(n), a(n)=A000005(n) iff n=2^k (A000079).
%C A080024 Not multiplicative. Counterexample: 441=3^2*7^2, a(441)=0, but a(3^2) = a(7^2) = 1. - _Christian G. Bower_, May 16 2005

%e A080024 Divisors of 36 = {1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,36}, 36->100100 and also 3,6,12 have two 1's in binary notation with 36 = 3*12 = 6*6, therefore a(36)=3 (18->10010 doesn't count, as 36/18 = 2 -> 10 has only one binary 1).
