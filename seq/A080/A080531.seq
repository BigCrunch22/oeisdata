%N A080531 Number of nucleons in longest known radioactive decay series ending with Lead 208 ("thorium series"), reversed.
%C A080531 The numbers are all equivalent to 0 mod 4. The sequence was submitted reversed, as it is open in the past. It is unknown if reversed decay series are finite (the "island of stability" hypothesis).
