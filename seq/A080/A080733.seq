%N A080733 Smallest distance from n to a squarefree number.

%C A080733 The sequence is unbounded.
%C A080733 The first 0 occurs at 1, the first 1 at 4, the first 2 at 49, the first 3 at 846. - _Antti Karttunen_, Sep 22 2017

%F A080733 a(A005117(n)) = 0.
%e A080733 For n = 3, 3 itself is a squarefree number, thus a(3) = 0.
%e A080733 For n = 48, 48 = 2^4 * 3 is not squarefree, 49 = 7^2 is not squarefree, but 47 is, thus a(48) = abs(48-47) = 1.
%e A080733 For n = 49, neither 49 = 7^2, nor 48 = 2^4 * 3 nor 50 = 2^2 * 5 is squarefree, while both 47 and 51 are, thus a(49) = abs(49-47) = abs(49-51) = 2.
