%N A309769 Even numbers m having at least one odd prime divisor p for which there exists a positive integer k < p-1 such that p-k|m-k.
%C A309769 Complement in A005843 of A309239. Every odd number > 1 has the property mentioned in Name, but these are the only even numbers with this property. No term is either a power of 2 or a semiprime. A number m is a term if and only if m = 2rp, where r >= 2, and p is a prime > q, the smallest prime divisor of 2r-1 (k=p-q). For any given r, 2rz is the smallest multiple of 2r in this sequence, where z=nextprime(q). If m = 2rp is a term and 2r-1 is prime, then p is the greatest prime divisor of m (the converse is not true; e.g., m=70=10*7).
%e A309769 20 = 4*5 is a term because with k=2, 5-k|20-k.
%e A309769 66 = 6*11 is a term (k=6), although when expressed as 66=22*3 no k exists.
%e A309769 110 = 10*11 = 22*5 is a term for two reasons, since with both of its odd prime factors it has the required property; 5-2|110-2 and 11-8|110-8. This is the smallest term having two distinct odd prime factors, both of which have the above property (see A309780, A309781).
