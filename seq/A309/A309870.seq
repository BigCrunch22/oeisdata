%N A309870 a(n) is the smallest number whose digits are 1's and 0's that cannot be written as a concatenation of any of the previous terms (not repeating any terms in the concatenation). a(0) = 0.
%C A309870 For each term k, k||k is also a term, where || denotes the operation of concatenation.

%e A309870 1 cannot be written as a concatenation of 0, therefore a(1) is 1.
%e A309870 10 = 1||0 but 11 cannot be concatenated 11 = 1||1 because 1 can only be used once, therefore a(2) is 11.
%Y A309870 Subsequence of A007088 (binary numbers).
