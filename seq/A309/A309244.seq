%N A309244 Triangle of number of nonsingular n X n matrices over GF(2) by number of ones.
%C A309244 The row for n begins with n-1 zeros since a matrix with fewer than n ones has an all-zero row.
%C A309244 The last entry in the row for n is T(n, n^2-n+1) as a matrix with more than n^2-n+1 ones must have two identical rows.
%C A309244 Each entry in the row for n is a multiple of n! since rows must be distinct.
%H A309244 Mathoverflow, <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/333837/the-number-of-non-singular-n-times-n-matrices-over-mathbbf-2-with-exactly">The number of non-singular n x n matrices over F2 with exactly k non-zero entries</a>, posted 12 Jun 2019.  Rows for n = 3 and n = 4 given by Richard Stanley in a comment.
%F A309244 T(n, n) = n!, T(n, n+1) = n!*n*(n-1), T(n, n^2-n+1) = n!*n (Weg, see Mathoverflow link).
%e A309244 T(2,3) = 4 from the 2 X 2 nonsingular matrices (1,1;1,0), (1,1;0,1), (1,0;1,1), and (0,1;1,1) which each have 3 ones.
