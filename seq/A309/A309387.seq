%N A309387 a(n) is the smallest positive divisor not yet in the sequence of 7*A000217(n-1); n >= 1.
%C A309387 Up to n=10000, 1166 of the first 1228 odd primes appear as fixed points of a(n), i.e., 95%.
%C A309387 Conjecture: for large p prime, the odd primes (except p) appear as fixed points of b(n), where b(n) is the smallest positive divisor not yet in the sequence of p*A000217(n-1); n >= 1 (see link).
