%N A309813 Records in A171898.
%C A309813 This is a subset of A171866 (records in A181391). Proof: each positive term m in A171866 also occurs in A181391, and the other way around, with a shift of m+1 positions. Consider a record r in A171866, which occurs in that sequence at position i; it occurs in A181391 at position i+r+1. Any larger term s>r must occur in A171866 at a position j>i (or r would not be a record), so its position in A181391, j+s+1, is larger than i+r+1. Therefore, r is also a record in A181391.
