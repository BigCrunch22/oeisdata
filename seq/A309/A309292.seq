%N A309292 Numbers that can be written as the sum of two primes, p, q, where p < q such that q^2 - p^2 is squarefree.
%e A309292 5 is in the sequence since 5 = 2 + 3 (both prime) and since 3^2 - 2^2 = 5 is squarefree.
%e A309292 7 is in the sequence since 7 = 2 + 5 (both prime) and since 5^2 - 2^2 = 21 is squarefree.
