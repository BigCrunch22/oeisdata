%C A309111 The Corner-Turning Octahedron is a regular octahedron puzzle in the style of Rubik's Cube. The octahedron is cut by 6 groups of n-1 equally-spaced planes not passing through the center, where the planes in each group are perpendicular to one of the 3 lines connecting a pair of opposite vertices of the octahedron. In comparison, the regular octahedron is cut by 4 groups of n-1 equally-spaced planes for the Face-Turning Octahedron of size n, where the planes in each group are parallel to one of the 4 pairs of opposite faces of the octahedron. As a result, the Corner-Turning Octahedron of size 2 is not the same of the Skewb Diamond, the Face-Turning Octahedron of size 2: its only rotations are the trivial rotations of the tips.
