%N A309011 Lexicographically earliest sequence of nonnegative integers such that for any n > 0, the palindromic word (a(n), a(n-1), ..., a(1), a(0), a(1), ..., a(n-1), a(n)) is squarefree.
%C A309011 A word is squarefree if it has no subsequence of the form XX.
%C A309011 This sequence has similarities with A007814, the lexicographically earliest squarefree sequence of nonnegative integers.
%C A309011 Is this sequence unbounded?

%e A309011 For n = 0:
%e A309011 - a(0) = 0.
%e A309011 For n = 1:
%e A309011 - "000" is not squarefree,
%e A309011 - "101" is squarefree,
%e A309011 - hence a(1) = 1,
%e A309011 For n = 2:
%e A309011 - "01010" is not squarefree,
%e A309011 - "11011" is not squarefree,
%e A309011 - "21012" is squarefree,
%e A309011 - hence a(2) = 2,
%e A309011 For n = 3:
%e A309011 - "0210120" is squarefree,
%e A309011 - hence a(3) = 0.
