%N A309786 a(n) is the length of the cycle of the trajectory of 1/n under the map f(x) = min(2*x, 2-2*x).
%C A309786 For any rational number q in the interval [0, 1]:
%C A309786 - f(q) is rational and lies in the interval [0, 1],
%C A309786 - denominator(f(q)) <= denominator(q),
%C A309786 - as there are only finitely many rational numbers whose denominator is less than or equal to that of q in the interval [0, 1],
%C A309786 - iteratively applying f to q eventually leads to a cycle,
%C A309786 - and the sequence is well defined.
%C A309786 For any irrational number x in the interval [0, 1]:
%C A309786 - f(x) is irrational and lies in the interval [0, 1],
%C A309786 - for any k > 0, as fixed points of the k-th iterate of f are rational,
%C A309786 - iteratively applying f to x never leads to a cycle.
%C A309786 As f is continuous on the interval [0, 1] and 1/7 has least period 3, according to the period three theorem, f has points of any period length, as well as chaotic points.

%F A309786 a(2*n-1) = A003558(n-1).
%F A309786 a(2*n) = a(n).
%F A309786 a(n) = 1 iff n belongs to A029744.
%F A309786 a(n) = 2 iff n belongs to A020714.
%e A309786 For n = 5:
%e A309786 - f(1/5) = 2/5,
%e A309786 - f(2/5) = 4/5,
%e A309786 - f(4/5) = 2/5,
%e A309786 - hence a(5) = 2.
