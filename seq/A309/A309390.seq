%N A309390 Set a(1)=10. Thereafter a(n) is the smallest positive number not yet in the sequence that contains exactly one even digit and one odd digit from a(n-1).
%C A309390 Numbers such as 3, 8, 20, 31, and 42 are not in the sequence since by definition all terms must contain both odd and even digits.
%e A309390 a(2)=100 since it is the smallest number not yet in the sequence that contains an even digit (0) and an odd digit (1) from a(1)=10.
%e A309390 a(7)=112 since it is the smallest number not yet in the sequence that contains an even digit (2) and an odd digit (1) from a(6)=21.
%e A309390 a(27)=126 is not 105 since 105 would contain two odd digits (1 and 5) from a(26)=152.
%Y A309390 Cf. A318700 (positive numbers that contain both odd and even digits).
