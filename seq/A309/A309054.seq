%C A309054 The sequence extends to negative n by defining a(n) = a(-n).
%C A309054 Consider a Sierpinski arrowhead curve formed of unit edges numbered consecutively from 0 at its axis of symmetry and aligned with an infinite Sierpinski gasket so that each edge is contained in the boundary of either the plane sector occupied by the gasket or a triangular region of the gasket's complement. If a(n) = 0, the n-th edge is contained in the sector boundary, otherwise the relevant triangular region has side a(n). Every length 3 segment of these boundaries contains exactly one edge of the arrowhead curve. A191108 lists positive n such that edge n is contained in the plane sector boundary. See A307672 for further properties.
%C A309054 See the graphic (in the links) of the arrowhead curve aligned with the gasket. Note the even-indexed edges (colored red) are the edges contained in a triangular region boundary on the left side of the vector. - _Peter Munn_, Jul 29 2019
%C A309054 a(n) = 0 if A307744(n) = 0, otherwise a(n) = 2^(A307744(n) - 1). Thus, this sequence has the symmetries of A307744, which are similar to ruler functions (especially A051064) and described further in A307744.
%C A309054 When listening to this, set pitch modulus to 35 or 36.

%e A309054 As 0 is congruent to 0 modulo 3, a(0) = 1.  So a(2) = 2*a(0) = 2*1 = 2.  So a(4) = 2*a(2) = 2*2 = 4.
