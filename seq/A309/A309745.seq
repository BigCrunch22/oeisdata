%N A309745 Indices k of highly composite numbers with records of low values of the ratio between consecutive terms, A002182(k+1)/A002182(k).
%C A309745 Ramanujan proved that the asymptotic limit of the ratio between consecutive highly composite numbers is 1. Therefore this sequence is infinite.
%C A309745 The first 26 terms were calculated from Achim Flammenkamp's list of the first 779674 highly composite numbers.
%C A309745 The corresponding highly composite numbers are A002182(a(n)) = 1, 4, 36, 48, 720, 25200, 665280, 698377680, 1606268664000, 8995104518400, 72779390658374400, ... and their corresponding consecutive terms are A002182(a(n)+1) = 2, 6, 48, 60, 840, 27720, 720720, 735134400, 1686582097200, 9316358251200, 74801040398884800, ...
%C A309745 The corresponding record ratios for the first 20 terms are of the form 1 + 1/m with m being an integer. The list of values of m is 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 12, 19, 20, 28, 36, 41, 176, 254, 345, 812, 9338, 10366, 21339, 44084, 89733/2, 497845/2, 435046, 800355, 30857708/23, 18882356170/7757, ...
