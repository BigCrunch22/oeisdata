%N A309631 a(n) is the smallest positive integer divisible by n such that it is possible to strike out a digit from its decimal expansion (apart from trailing zeros) so that the resulting number is nonzero and divisible by n.
%C A309631 The idea of this sequence comes from a problem in the annual Moscow Mathematical Olympiad (MMO) in 2004: problem 3, Level D. The problem asks for a proof that for any positive n, there exists a number m divisible by n such that it is possible to strike out a certain digit d (not a trailing zero) from its decimal expansion so that the number thus obtained will also be divisible by n and nonzero. Here, the sequence proposes to find the smallest such integer m called a(n).

%e A309631 a(6) = 36 because 36 and 6 are divisible by 6, and there is no integer < 36 with this property.
%e A309631 a(19) = 2109 because 2109 = 19*111 and, if we strike out "1", 209 = 19*11 also is divisible by 19, and there is no integer < 2109 with this property.
