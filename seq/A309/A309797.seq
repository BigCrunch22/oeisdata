%N A309797 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers such that for any n > 0 there are no more than a(n) numbers k > 0 such that a(n + k) = a(n + 2*k).
%C A309797 The sequence is well defined as we can always extend the sequence with a number that has not yet appeared.
%C A309797 The number 1 appears infinitely many times in the sequence:
%C A309797 - by contradiction: suppose that m is the index of the last occurrence of 1 in the sequence,
%C A309797 - there is no n > 0 such that n + k = m and n + 2*k = 2*m (with k > 0),
%C A309797 - so we can choose a(2*m) = 1, QED.
%C A309797 This sequence has connections with A003602:
%C A309797 - here we have up to a(n) numbers k such that a(n+k) = a(n+2*k), there we have no such numbers,
%C A309797 - for any v >= 0, let f_v be the lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers such that there are no more than v numbers k such that f_v(n + k) = f_v(n + 2*k),
%C A309797 - then f_v corresponds to A003602 where all but the first term have been repeated 2*v+1 times.
