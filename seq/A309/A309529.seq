%N A309529 Start with a(1)=2; thereafter the sequence is always extended by adding the n-th digit of the sequence to a(n) if a(n) is even, else subtracting it.
%C A309529 Among the first 10^8 terms, the last positive value occurs at n=28823742. - _Lars Blomberg_, Aug 10 2019

%e A309529 The sequence begins with 2,4,8,16,17,11,10,17,...
%e A309529 As a(1) = 2 (even), we have a(2) = a(1) + [the 1st digit of the seq] = 2 + 2 = 4;
%e A309529 as a(2) = 4 (even), we have a(3) = a(2) + [the 2nd digit of the seq] = 4 + 4 = 8;
%e A309529 as a(3) = 8 (even), we have a(4) = a(3) + [the 3rd digit of the seq] = 8 + 8 = 16;
%e A309529 as a(4) = 16 (even), we have a(5) = a(4) + [the 4th digit of the seq] = 16 + 1 = 17;
%e A309529 as a(5) = 17 (odd), we have a(6) = a(5) - [the 5th digit of the seq] = 17 - 6 = 11;
%e A309529 as a(6) = 11 (odd), we have a(7) = a(6) - [the 6th digit of the seq] = 11 - 1 = 10;
