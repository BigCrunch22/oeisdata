%N A309521 The sequence is always extended by subtracting the n-th digit of the sequence from a(n) if a(n) is prime, else adding it to a(n), starting with a(1) = 4.
%C A309521 Up to 10^6 the terms increase approximately linearly, and no cycles are visible. As we approach a million terms the terms are 3590238, 3590240, 3590242, 3590248, 3590251, 3590251, 3590257, 3590259, 3590261, 3590267, 3590270, 3590279, 3590285, 3590287, 3590289, 3590295, 3590298, 3590306, 3590312, 3590314, 3590316, 3590322, 3590326, 3590326, 3590332, 3590334, 3590336, 3590342, 3590346, ..., and the smallest values not yet encountered at that point are 2, 3, 6, 7, 13, 14, 19, 20, 24, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46, 49, 51, 53, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 83, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 100, 108, 109, 110, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, ... - _Lars Blomberg_, Aug 06 2019
