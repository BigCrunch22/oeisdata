%N A309374 Numbers k such that k+j is prime for every j, where 1 <= j < k and gcd(j,k) = 1.
%C A309374 It was conjectured by Recamán Santos in 1976 and proved by Hausman and Shapiro in 1978 that 12 is the largest k possible.
%C A309374 Pomerance & Penney (1977) reported in a letter that they have proved that the conjecture is true. - _Amiram Eldar_, May 15 2020
