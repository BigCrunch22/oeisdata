%N A309093 The analog of A309077(n), but allowing fractional powers.
%C A309093 Let x be a length-n binary word, and consider a factorization of the form prod_i w_i^{e_i}, where e_i can be any rational number.  Here w^e means the prefix of www... of length e|w|.  A factorization is minimal if the sum of the |w_i| is minimized, and this is called the (fractional) weight of the word x.  Then a(n) is the maximum, over all length-n binary strings x, of the weight of x.
%e A309093 For n = 10, the word 0010110010 has factorization 0 (01)^2 (100)^{5/3}, of weight 6.
%Y A309093 Cf. A309077, A309094.
