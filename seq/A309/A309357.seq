%N A309357 a(0) = 10; for n>0, a(n) is determined by the rule that the concatenation of the leading terms of the difference triangle is the same as the concatenation of the digits of the sequence, with a one-digit delay between the two concatenations.
%C A309357 Data provided by Lars Blomberg with the comment: "The chosen algorithm breaks down at n=40, probably needs backtracking in order to get further, if at all possible".
%C A309357 It would be nice to have some information about the algorithm used to find this sequence. Is it correct to say that this is "the lexicographically earliest infinite increasing sequence" with the stated property? How many terms are known for certain? - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 02 2019
