%N A309524 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of simple connected graphs on n nodes with longest path having k nodes, (1 <= k <= n).
%C A309524 Paths here are subgraphs that are isomorphic to a path graph and are measured by the number of vertices they contain rather than the number of edges. No vertex can appear more than once.
%C A309524 Paths with three vertices exist in all connected graphs with at least three vertices. For n > 3, the star graph is the only graph in which longer paths are not possible.
