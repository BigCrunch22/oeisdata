%N A309263 Terms of A140110 that are not divisible by 6.
%C A309263 Includes all powers of 2.
%C A309263 Conjecture: The sequence includes all numbers of the form 4*5^n.
%C A309263 The number 10100 is a counterexample for: (a) Prime factorizations of numbers of this sequence will always have only 2's and Fermat primes. (b) No number in this sequence is divisible by more than one distinct odd prime.
%e A309263 20 is in this sequence because it is in A140110 and is not divisible by 6.
%e A309263 24, which is in A140110, is not in this sequence because it is divisible by 6.
