%N A309617 Integers that concatenate 3 counts: the number of terms in the sequence so far, the number of primes in the sequence so far, the number of digits in the sequence so far, with a(1)= 113. The sequence is always extended with the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction or a dead end.
%C A309617 What would a dead end be? We have here a(8) = 8329 though a(8) = 8229 is sound (and lexicographically better); but 8229 brings the sequence to an end after a(9) = 9233 and a(10) = 10238 (indeed, 10238 can't be followed by anything without a contradiction). It is unknown by the authors if this sequence is finite or not.

%e A309617 a(1) = 113 must be read like this: "so far in the sequence there are 1 integer, 1 prime and 3 digits", which is true;
%e A309617 a(2) = 216 must be read like this: "so far in the sequence there are 2 integers, 1 prime and 6 digits", which is true;
%e A309617 a(3) = 319 must be read like this: "so far in the sequence there are 3 integers, 1 prime and 9 digits", which is true;
%e A309617 ...
%e A309617 a(6) = 6221 must be read like this: "so far in the sequence there are 6 integers, 2 primes and 21 digits", which is true (the 2 primes are 113 and 6221 itself);
