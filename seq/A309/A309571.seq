%N A309571 Start with a(1)=1; thereafter the sequence is always extended by adding the n-th digit of the sequence to a(n) if both are of the same parity, otherwise subtracting it.

%e A309571 The sequence S begins with 1,2,4,8,16,15,9,10,5,...
%e A309571 As a(1) = 1 and the 1st digit of S are of same parity, we get a(2) = 1 + 1 = 2;
%e A309571 as a(2) = 2 and the 2nd digit of S are of same parity, we get a(3) = 2 + 2 = 4;
%e A309571 as a(3) = 4 and the 3rd digit of S are of same parity, we get a(4) = 4 + 4 = 8;
%e A309571 as a(4) = 8 and the 4th digit of S are of same parity, we get a(5) = 8 + 8 = 16;
%e A309571 as a(5) = 16 and the 5th digit of S are not of same parity, we get a(6) = 16 - 1 = 15;
%e A309571 as a(6) = 15 and the 6th digit of S are not of same parity, we get a(7) = 15 - 6 = 9;
%e A309571 as a(7) = 8 and the 7th digit of S are of same parity, we get a(8) = 9 + 1 = 10.
