%N A309251 Period of Langton's ant on an n X n torus.
%C A309251 This is the period of a full cycle of Langton's ant--i.e., how long it takes for the ant to end up in the same location where it started, facing in the same direction, with the torus having the same coloration as at the beginning.
%C A309251 If the same location requirement is dropped, the values for n=3,5,7,9 decrease significantly.
