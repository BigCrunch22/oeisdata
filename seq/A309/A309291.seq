%N A309291 Primes of the form k!-p where p <= k!/2 is also a prime and k=3,4,5,....
%C A309291 This sequence provides a complete listing of primes of the form k!-p ordered by groups that are adjacent to each other respectively to intervals [k!/2, k!], for k=3,4,5,..., till there are no further primes in the current interval.
%C A309291 This demonstrates that most of the primes in the interval [k!/2, k!], for k>4, have the form k!-p and are symmetric about the half of a factorial number with initial primes p, but not all of them.
%C A309291 Conjecture 1: every prime number in the interval [k!-k^2, k!-k] for k>4 has only the form k!-p where p is the n-th prime.
%C A309291 It is easily proved that if q is the prime in the interval [k!-k^2, k!-k] for k>4, then k!-q is always a prime number.

%e A309291 The first terms 3=3!-3 and 13=4!-11, 17=4!-7, 19=4!-5 are primes of the form k!-p in the intervals [3!/2, 3!] and [4!/2, 4!] accordingly.
