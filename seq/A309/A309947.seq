%N A309947 a(n) = A309891(A025487(n)): For each prime signature, gives the sum of the number of trailing zeros for all bases b >= 2 for some number m with that prime signature. The prime signatures are chosen in order in which they are first seen in the positive integers.
%C A309947 A309891(n) only depends on the prime signature of n. This sequence lists the values for different prime signatures based on A025487 which lists the least positive integer for each prime signature.
%e A309947 A309891(A025487(6)) = A309891(12) = 6.
