%N A309778 a(n) is the greatest integer such that, for every positive integer k <= a(n), n^2 can be written as the sum of k positive square integers.
%C A309778 The idea for this sequence comes from the 6th problem of the 2nd day of the 33rd International Mathematical Olympiad in Moscow, 1992 (see link).
%C A309778 There are four cases to examine and three possible values for a(n).
%C A309778 a(n) = 1 iff n is a nonhypotenuse number or iff n is in A004144.
%C A309778 a(n) >= 2 iff n is a hypotenuse number or iff n is in A009003.
%C A309778 a(n) = 2 iff n^2 is the sum of two positive squares but not the sum of three positive squares or iff n^2 is in A309779.
%C A309778 a(n) = n^2 - 14 iff n^2 is the sum of two and three positive squares or iff n^2 is in A231632.
%C A309778 Theorem: a square n^2 is the sum of k positive squares for all 1 <= k <= n^2 - 14 iff n^2 is the sum of 2 and 3 positive squares (proof in Kuczma). Consequently: A231632 = A018820.

%e A309778 1 = 1^2, 4 = 2^2 and a(1) = a(2) = 1.
%e A309778 25 = 5^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 and a(5) = 2.
%e A309778 The first representations of 169 are 13^2 = 12^2 + 5^2 = 12^2 + 4^2 + 3^2 = 11^2 + 4^2 + 4^2 + 4^2 =  6^2 + 6^2 + 6^2 + 6^2 + 5^2  = 6^2 + 6^2 + 6^2 + 6^2 + 4^2 + 3^2 = ... and a(13) = 13^2 - 14 = 155.
