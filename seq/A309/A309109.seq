%N A309109 Number of possible permutations of a Pyraminx of size n, disregarding the trivial rotation of the tips.

%C A309109 The Pyraminx, or the Corner-Turning Tetrahedron, is a regular tetrahedron puzzle in the style of Rubik's Cube. The tetrahedron is cut by 4 groups of n-1 equally-spaced planes, where the planes in each group are perpendicular to one of the 4 faces of the tetrahedron. In comparison, the regular tetrahedron is cut by 3 groups of n-1 equally-spaced planes for the Edge-Turning Tetrahedron of size n, where the planes in each group are parallel to one of the 3 pairs of opposite edges of the tetrahedron. As a result, the Corner-Turning Tetrahedron of size 2 is not the same of the Pyramorphix, the Edge-Turning Tetrahedron of size 2: its only rotations are the trivial rotations of the tips, while the latter is isomorphic to the Rubik's Cube of size 2 as puzzles.
