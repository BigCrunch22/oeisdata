%N A309035 If a(n) is not a term of a(0),...,a(n-1), then a(n+1) = n - m, where m is the most recent time that some new value a(m) appeared for the first time; otherwise a(n+1) is the number of terms equal to a(n) in a(0),...,a(n-1). Start with a(0)=0, a(1)=0.
%C A309035 In other words, if the last term a(n) has not appeared previously, take the difference between its index n and the lowest index m of the last term to appear for the first time to obtain the next term. Otherwise, the next term is the number of terms equal to a(n) in a(0),...,a(n-1).
%e A309035 a(0)=0 (given).
%e A309035 a(1)=0 (given).
%e A309035 a(2)=1: a(1)=0 is a term of a(0..0), therefore a(2) = number of terms=0 in a(0..0) = 1.
%e A309035 a(3)=2: a(2)=1 is not a term of a(0..1), first appearance of a new term is at a(0), therefore a(3) = 2 - 0 = 2.
%e A309035 a(4)=1: a(3)=2 is not a term of a(0..2), first appearance of a new term is at a(2), therefore: 3 - 2 = 1.
%e A309035 a(5)=1: a(4)=1 is a term of a(0..3), therefore a(5) = Number of terms=1 in a(0..3) = 1.
%e A309035 a(6)=2: a(5)=1 is a term of a(0..4), therefore a(6) = Number of terms=1 in a(0..4) = 2.
%e A309035 a(7)=1: a(6)=2 is a term of a(0..5), therefore a(7) = Number of terms=2 in a(0..5) = 1.
%e A309035 a(8)=3: a(7)=1 is a term of a(0..6), therefore a(8) = Number of terms=1 in a(0..6) = 3.
%e A309035 a(9)=5: a(8)=3 is not a term of a(0..7), first appearance of a new term is at a(3), therefore: 8 - 3 = 5.
%e A309035 a(10)=1: a(9)=5 is not a term of a(0..8), first appearance of a new term is at a(8), therefore: 9 - 8 = 1.
