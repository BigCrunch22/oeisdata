%N A309695 Smallest members of prime 5-tuples whose sum is a prime.
%C A309695 A prime 5-tuple is a set of five prime numbers of one of two forms: (p, p+2, p+6, p+8, p+12) and (p, p+4, p+6, p+10, p+12), with sums 5p+28 and 5p+32, respectively.
%C A309695 For either form, the sum of the five members sometimes yields a prime. It has been observed that a prime sum is yielded less frequently by quintuplets of the first form than by those of the second.
%C A309695 In the first 250 terms, quintuplets of the first form (see the preceding comments) represent just over 46% of the terms and quintuplets of the second form represent just over 53% of the terms. - _Harvey P. Dale_, Sep 04 2023

%e A309695 For p=5, (p, p+2, p+6, p+8, p+12) = (5,7,11,13,17): all primes, hence a prime 5-tuple. Their sum, 5p+28 = 53, is a prime, so 5, the smallest member, is a term of the sequence.
%e A309695 For p=7, (p, p+2, p+6, p+8, p+12) = (7,9,13,15,19); not all members are prime, but (p, p+4, p+6, p+10, p+12) = (7,11,13,17,19), all primes, hence a prime 5-tuple; their sum, 5p+32 = 67, is a prime, so 7, the smallest member, is a term of the sequence.
