%N A309129 Numbers n such that -n is a quadratic nonresidue modulo all odd primes p <= sqrt(n) which do not divide n.
%C A309129 Contains A000926 and A003173 (except the term 11) as subsequences.
%C A309129 Conjecture: 1848 is the last term of this sequence.
%e A309129 42 is in this sequence because sqrt(42) = 6.480740..., and -42 is quadratic nonresidue mod all odd primes < 6.480740... not dividing 42 (only mod 5).
%e A309129 67 is in this sequence because sqrt(67) = 8.185352..., and -67 is quadratic nonresidue mod all odd primes < 8.185352... not dividing 67 (mod 3, mod 5 and mod 7).
%e A309129 17 is not in this sequence because -17 is quadratic residue mod 3 and 3 < sqrt(17) and 3 does not divide 17.
%e A309129 90 is not in this sequence because -90 is quadratic residue mod 7 and 7 < sqrt(90) and 7 does not divide 90.
%e A309129 For n < 9, the range of p is empty, thus the numbers n < 9 are trivially in this sequence.
%o A309129 (PARI) a(n)=forprime(p=3, ,if(kronecker(-n,p)==1,return(p)))
%o A309129 for(k=1, 10^6,if(a(k)>sqrt(k),print1(k, ", ")))
%Y A309129 Cf. A000926, A003173.
