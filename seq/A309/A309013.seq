%N A309013 Lexicographically earliest squarefree sequence of nonnegative integers whose even and odd bisections are also squarefree.
%C A309013 A sequence is squarefree if it has no subsequence of the form XX.
%C A309013 Is this sequence unbounded?

%F A309013 Apparently, a(3*k+1) = 0 for any k >= 0.
%e A309013 For n = 1:
%e A309013 - "0" is squarefree,
%e A309013 - hence a(1) = 0.
%e A309013 For n = 2:
%e A309013 - "00" is not squarefree,
%e A309013 - "01" and "1" are squarefree,
%e A309013 - hence a(2) = 1.
%e A309013 For n = 3:
%e A309013 - "010" is squarefree but "00" is not,
%e A309013 - "011" is not squarefree,
%e A309013 - "012" and "02" are squarefree,
%e A309013 - hence a(3) = 2.
%e A309013 For n = 4:
%e A309013 - "0120" and "10" are squarefree,
%e A309013 - hence a(4) = 0.
