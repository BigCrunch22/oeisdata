%N A309590 Inverse of A309589: 0-based positions in the number subsets {0, ..., 10^k - 1} written in base 10 and sorted lexicographically, for k = 1, 2, ...
%C A309590 The sequence is related to the flattened form of the irregular table T(k, i) described in A309589. There, the rows for k >= 1 contain a permutation of the numbers 0 <= i <= 10^k - 1 which is defined by the lexicographical order of the numbers i written in base 10.
%C A309590 The sequence here lists, per sorted row k, the 0-based positions of the numbers i in that row. The positions in row k are also a permutation of the numbers 0 <= i <= 10^k - 1.
