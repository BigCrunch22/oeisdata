%N A309837 Where records occur in A327642.
%C A309837 Numbers where the number of partitions of n into divisors of n that are at most sqrt(n) increases to a record.
%C A309837 Is k unbounded where k | a(n) for all n > m for some m. For example, does 2 | a(n) for all n > 1? Does 60 | a(n) for all n > 27?
%e A309837 There are 1072 partitions of 36 into divisors <= sqrt(36) of 36, i.e. there are 1072 partitions of 36 into parts 1, 2, 3 and 6. For all k < 36, this number of partitions is < 1073 so 36 is in the sequence.
