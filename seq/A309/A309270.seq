%N A309270 a(n) is the largest k such that the first k odd primes can be covered by n arithmetic progressions of primes.
%C A309270 Here we allow the arithmetic progressions to contain one or more terms.
%C A309270 The first 1000 odd primes can be covered with 221 arithmetic progressions of primes (see Links).
%C A309270 Finding the smallest n for a given k is a set covering problem with a binary variable for each arithmetic progression and a constraint for each of the first k odd primes. - _Rob Pratt_, Aug 26 2019

%e A309270 1 arithmetic progression of primes is needed to cover the first 3 odd primes: (3,5,7). So a(1) = 3. Note that we cannot cover the first 4 odd primes with 1 arithmetic progression.
%e A309270 2 arithmetic progressions of primes are needed to cover the first 5 odd primes: (3,7,11), (5,13). So a(2) = 5.
%e A309270 3 arithmetic progressions of primes are needed to cover the first 10 odd primes: (3,17,31), (5,11,17,23,29), (7,13,19). So a(3) = 10.
%e A309270 4 arithmetic progressions of primes are needed to cover the first 13 odd primes: (3,13,23), (5,17,29,41), (7,19,31,43), (11,37). So a(4) = 13.
%e A309270 5 arithmetic progressions of primes are needed to cover the first 18 odd primes: (5,11,17,23,29), (7,19,31,43), (41,47,53,59), (13,37,61), (3,67). So a(5) = 18.
