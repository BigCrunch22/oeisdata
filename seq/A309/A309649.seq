%N A309649 Sieved recursive primeth recurrence (see Comments for precise definition).
%C A309649 This is a sieve constructed on the baise of A007097 (the "primeth recurrence"). Delete the elements of A007097 in the list of the prime numbers and take the smallest remaining prime and call it a(2). Start a new primeth recurrence series with a(2) as starting element instead of 1. Take b(1) to be a(2), then b(2) is the b(1)-th prime, then b(3) is the b(2)-th prime and so on. Delete also the numbers b(i) of this new sequence from the primes. Again take the smallest remaining prime and callit a(3). Start a new primeth recurrence series with this number a(3) as starting element. Continue this process and retain all smallest elements 1, a(2), a(3), a(4), ... The resulting sequence is 1, 7, 13, 19, 23, 29, 37, 43, 47, 53, 61, 71, 73, 79, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 113, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 163, 167, 173, 181, 193, 197, 199, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 251, 257, 263, ...
%C A309649 Appears to be essentially the same as A088982 and A007821. - _R. J. Mathar_, Aug 22 2019
%e A309649 First term a(1)=1.
%e A309649 For the 2nd term: take all primes and delete the primes from the sequence A007097 : 1,2,3,5,11,31,127, ..
%e A309649 This gives: 7,13,17,19, .. (1)
%e A309649 The smallest term is 7. Our a(2)=7.
%e A309649 Now construct an A007097 series with the starting term 7 instead of 1.
%e A309649 The 7th prime is 17. The 17th prime is 59. the 59th prime is 277. The numbers to delete from series (1) are 7,17,59,277 ..
%e A309649 This gives: 13,19,23,29,..  (2)
%e A309649 The smallest term now is 13. Our a(3)=13.
%e A309649 The next A007097 like series starting with 13 is the following.
%e A309649 13,41,179,.. which we delete from (2).
%e A309649 This gives: 19,23,29,..  (3)
%e A309649 The smallest term now is 19. Our a(4)=19.
%e A309649 And so on.
