%C A141107 2. Let S(n)=(1/2)*(1+A141107(n)). Is the complement of S equal to A004976?
%C A141107 3. Is A141107 = 1 + A141104?
%C A141107 Both #2 and #3 are true.  They can be proved with the Walnut theorem-prover, using the synchronized Fibonacci automaton for the sequences A141104 and A141107.  These automata take n and y as input, in Fibonacci (Zeckendorf) representation, and accept iff y = a(n) for the respective sequence. - _Jeffrey Shallit_, Jan 27 2024
%F A141107 Let a = (1,3,4,6,8,9,11,12,...) = A000201 = lower Wythoff sequence; let b = (2,5,7,10,13,15,18,...) = A001950 = upper Wythoff sequence. For each even b(n), let a(m) be the greatest number in a such that after swapping b(n) and a(m), the resulting new a and b are both increasing. A141107 is the sequence obtained by thus swapping all evens out of A001950.
