%N A141399 A positive integer k is included if all the distinct primes that divide k and k+1 together are members of a set of consecutive primes. In other words, k is included if and only if k*(k+1) is contained in sequence A073491.
%C A141399 The smallest prime in the set of consecutive primes is always 2, since k*(k+1) is even.
%C A141399 No further terms thru 5*10^8. - _Ray Chandler_, Jun 24 2009
%C A141399 a(29) > 2.29*10^25, if it exists. - _Giovanni Resta_, Nov 30 2019
%e A141399 20 is factored as 2^2 * 5^1. 21 is factored as 3^1 * 7^1. Since the distinct primes that divide 20 and 21 (which are 2,3,5,7) form a set of consecutive primes, then 20 is in the sequence.
