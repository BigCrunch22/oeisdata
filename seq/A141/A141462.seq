%N A141462 Transformed nonprime products of prime factors of the composites, the largest prime decremented by 2, the smallest by 1.
%C A141462 In the prime factorization of k=A002808(i), i=1,2,3,..., one instance of the largest prime, pmax=A052369(i), is replaced by pmax-2 and one instance of the smallest prime, pmin=A056608(i), is replaced by pmin-1. If the product of this modified set of factors, k*(pmax-2)*(pmin-1)/(pmin*pmax), is nonprime, it is a term of the sequence.
