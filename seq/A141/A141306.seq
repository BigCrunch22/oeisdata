%N A141306 Approximate prime counts at 10^n resulting from an experimental algorithm designed to estimate with 99+% accuracy unknown values of 10^n.
%C A141306 The purpose of this sequence is to encourage experimentation. The number of primes at each power of 10 through 10^23 is now known exactly. Using this information, I created, by trial and error, an algorithm to check its accuracy against known counts (see UBASIC program) and to predict rough approximate values for those counts yet to be discovered. At increasing powers of 10 this program approaches 100% accuracy.
%C A141306 In the algorithm below, the value 9.14615 may be changed to 10 or to any other value between 9.1 and 10. With value 9.14615 the predicted value at 10^21 is ~100% accurate and with value 9.1151 the predicted value at 10^23 is also ~100% accurate and at some point the correct value may converge to a value of 9.1.
%C A141306 Starting at 10^2, the percent accuracy is less than the next at 10^3 and the values undulate alternately between <, >, <, >, ... thereafter.
%C A141306 Using 9.14615 (accurate for a limit of 10^21) in the program and beginning at 10^2, the estimate compared to the true value - the percent accuracy (truncated, not rounded) is: 10^2 - 87.9%, 10^3 - 98.8%, 10^4 - 90.0%, 10^5 - 96.1%, 10^6 - 93.9%, 10^7 - 97.1%, 10^8 - 96.0%, 10^9 - 97.9%, 10^10 - 97.2%, 10^11 - 98.5%, 10^12 - 98.0%, 10^13 - 98.9%, 10^14 - 98.6%, 10^15 - 99.3, 10^16 - 99.0%, 10^17 - 99.5%, 10^18 - 99.4%, 10^19 - 99.8%, 10^20 - 99.6%, 10^21 - ~100.0%.
%C A141306 Using 9.1151 (accurate for a limit of 10^23) in the program, at 10^22 - 99.7% and 10^23 - 99.9% or ~100%.
%C A141306 pi(10^n) ~ 10^n / log(10^n). The divisor Y in this sequence is floor(n^2/2), so the sequence varies as 10^n/n * 0.442666605... while pi(10^n) varies as (10^n/n) * 0.434294481....
%C A141306 Refit to target 10^29, the coefficient reduces to ~9.0466. - _Bill McEachen_, Dec 12 2022

%F A141306 N=(log(9.14615^X)*10^(X-1))/Y where X=power of 10 and Y=divisor beginning at 2 and thereafter by differencing two successive terms so that we have y = 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24 with differences 2,2,4,4,6,6,8,8, etc. Above a(1)=0 because at 10^1 x=1 and y=0 so is omitted.
%F A141306 a(n) = round(log(9.14615^n)*10^(n-1)/floor(n^2/2)).
%F A141306 a(n) ~ 0.442666605... * 10^n/n.
%e A141306 a(4)=1107 because when X=4 and Y=8, then N=(log(9.14615^X)*10^(X-1))/Y = 1107.
