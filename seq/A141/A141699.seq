%N A141699 Arrange the distinct prime divisors of each non-prime-power positive integer n in order from smallest to largest. n is included in sequence A141699 if the differences between consecutive primes in the arrangement of primes are all non-prime-powers.
%e A141699 1564 has the prime factorization 2^2 *17^1 *23^1. So the distinct primes dividing 1564 are 2, 17 and 23. 17-2 = 15, which is not a power of a prime. 23 -17 = 6, which is also not a power of a prime. So 1564 is included in this sequence.
