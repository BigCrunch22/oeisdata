%N A141537 An example of a simple prime-generating formula similar to Rowland's ( a(1) = 7, n>1, a(n) = a(n-1) + gcd(n,a(n-1) ) that is a particular instance of a more general formula. The sequence submitted is the first 20 values that do not equal '1':.
%C A141537 Below is a general expression that can be used as a starting point for finding similar formulas and three examples.
%C A141537 Be forewarned that not every possibility will work - additional conditions may apply -but it is easy to see that there are no doubt actually an infinite number of algorisms much like Rowland's that will have hundreds or thousands of primes between the 1's before a composite is encountered.
%C A141537 1) initialize the integers x,k,a,b and choose f(x), f(k).
%C A141537 2) repeat indefinitely a two-step process:
%C A141537 x := x + 1,
%C A141537 If GCD( f(x), f(x - 1) - a* f(k) ) > 1, then k := k + b;
%C A141537 Examples:
%C A141537 A) f(x) := 5*x^2 + 5*x + 1, f(k) = k, x = 1, k = 2, a = 10, b = 1;
%C A141537 the first 20 values of the sequence that do not equal one: 11, 31, 61, 101, 151, 211, 281, 19, 41, 29, 661, 11, 911,1051,1201,1361,1531,59,1901
%C A141537 B) f(x) := x^2 - x + 41, f(k) := k, x = 1, k = 2, a = 3, b = 1;
%C A141537 the first 20 values of the sequence that do not equal one: 47, 227, 71, 359, 113, 563, 173, 839, 251,1187,347, 1607, 461,2099,593, 2663, 743,3299, 911,4007
%C A141537 C) f(x) := 5*x^2 + 5*x + 1, f(k) = x^2 - x + 41, x = 1, k = 2, a = 2, b = 1;
%C A141537 the first 20 values of the sequence that do not equal one: 11, 1979, 2549, 11,4691, 11, 8929, 29, 11, 22051, 41, 19, 48619, 61751, 11, 229, 11, 144779, 175141, 11

%F A141537 1) initialize the integers x,k,a,b and choose f(x), f(k). 2) repeat indefinitely a two-step process: x := x + 1, If GCD( f(x), f(x - 1) - a* f(k) ) > 1, then k := k + b; In the above formual let f(x) := x^2 - x + 41, f(k) := k, x = 1, k = 2, a = 3, b = 1.
