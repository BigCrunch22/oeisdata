%N A141228 Number of points having maximal visibility in a cubic n x n x n lattice.
%C A141228 Sequence A141227 gives the maximum number of points visible from some point. By symmetry, when a(n) is odd, the central point in the lattice can see the maximal number of points. When a(n)=1, the central point is the only such point. Apparently the numbers n in A141226 produce both the n x n and n x n x n lattices having central points with maximum visibility.
%t A141228 Table[mx=0; pts=0; Do[cnt=0; Do[If[GCD[d-a,e-b,f-c]<2, cnt++ ], {a,n}, {b,n}, {c,n}]; If[cnt>mx, mx=cnt; pts=1, If[cnt==mx, pts++ ]], {d,n}, {e,n}, {f,n}]; pts, {n,10}]
