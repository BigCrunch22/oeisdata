%N A141158 Duplicate of A038872.
%C A141158 Original name was: Primes of the form x^2 + 4*x*y - y^2.
%C A141158 Discriminant = 20. Class number = 1. Binary quadratic forms a*x^2 + b*x*y + c*y^2 have discriminant d = b^2 - 4ac and gcd(a,b,c) = 1 (primitive).
%C A141158 Values of the quadratic form are {0, 1, 4} mod 5, so this is a subsequence of A038872. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jul 30 2008
%C A141158 Is this the same sequence as A038872? [Yes. See a comment in A038872, and the comment by _Jianing Song_ below. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jun 19 2019]
%C A141158 Also primes of the form u^2 - 5v^2. The transformation {u,v}={x+2y,y} transforms it into the one in the title. - _Tito Piezas III_, Dec 28 2008

%C A141158 Yes, this is a duplicate of A038872. For primes p congruent to {1, 4} mod 5, they split in the ring Z[(1+sqrt(5))/2]. Since Z[(1+sqrt(5))/2] is a UFD, they are reducible in Z[(1+sqrt(5))/2], so we have p = e*((a + b*sqrt(5))/2)*((a - b*sqrt(5))/2), where a and b have the same parity and e = +-1. WLOG we can suppose e = 1, otherwise substitute a, b by (a+5*b)/2 and (a+b)/2. Now we show that there exists integer u, v such that p = (u + v*sqrt(5))*(u - v*sqrt(5)) = u^2 - 5*v^2.
%C A141158 (i) If u, v are both even, then choose u = a/2, v = b/2.
%C A141158 (ii) If u, v are both odd, 4 | (a-b), then choose u = (3*a+5*b)/4, v = (3*b+a)/4.
%C A141158 (iii) If u, v are both odd, 4 | (a+b), then choose u = (3*a-5*b)/4, v = (3*b-a)/4.
%C A141158 Hence every prime congruent to {1, 4} mod 5 is of the form u^2 - 5*v^2. On the other hand, u^2 - 5*v^2 == 0, 1, 4 (mod 5). So these two sequences are the same.
%C A141158 Also primes of the form x^2 - x*y - y^2 (discriminant 5) with 0 <= x <= y (or x^2 + x*y - y^2 with x, y nonnegative). (End) [Comment revised by _Jianing Song_, Feb 24 2021]
%e A141158 a(3) = 19 because we can write 19 = 2^2 + 4*2*5 - 5^2.
