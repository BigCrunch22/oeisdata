%N A141069 List of different composites in Pascal-like triangles with index of asymmetry y = 3 and index of obliqueness z = 0 or z = 1.
%C A141069 For the Pascal-like triangle with index of asymmetry y = 3 and index of obliqueness z = 0, which is read by rows, we have G(n, 0) = G(n+1, n+1) = 1, G(n+2, n+1) = 2, G(n+3, n+1) = 4, G(n+4, n+1) = 8, and G(n+5, k) = G(n+1, k-1) + G(n+1, k) + G(n+2, k) + G(n+3, k) + G(n+4, k) for n >= 0 and k = 1..(n+1). (This is array A140996.)
%C A141069 For the Pascal-like triangle with index of asymmetry y = 3 and index of obliqueness z = 1, which is read by rows, we have G(n, n) = G(n+1, 0) = 1, G(n+2, 1) = 2, G(n+3, 2) = 4, G(n+4, 3) = 8, and  G(n+5, k) = G(n+1, k-3) + G(n+1, k-4) + G(n+2, k-3) + G(n+3, k-2) + G(n+4, k-1) for n >= 0 and k = 4..(n+4). (This is array A140995.)
%C A141069 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jun 13 2019: (Start)
%C A141069 The arrays A140995 and A140996, which are described above, are mirror images of one another.
%C A141069 To make the current sequence uniquely defined, we follow the suggestion of _R. J. Mathar_ for sequence A141064. For each row of array A140996, the composites not appearing in earlier rows are collected, sorted, and added to the sequence. We get exactly the same sequence by working with array A140995 instead.
%C A141069 Finally, we explain the meaning of the double recurrence in the attached photograph. It concerns the connection between Stepan's triangles and Pascal's triangles. The creator of the stone slab uses the notation G_n^k to denote the double array G(n, k), where 0 <= k <= n.
%C A141069 On the stone slab, the letter s is used to denote the "index of asymmetry" (denoted by y here) and the letter e is used to denote the 0-1 "index of obliqueness" (denoted by z here). Thus, as described above, there are two kinds of Stepan-Pascal triangles depending on whether e is equal to 0 or 1. (The case s = 0 corresponds to Pascal's triangle A007318.)
%C A141069 If e = 0, the value of k goes from 1 to n + 1, whereas if e = 1 the value of k goes from s + 1 to n + s + 1.
%C A141069 The "index of asymmetry" s = y can take any (fixed) integer value from 0 to infinity. The fixed value of s = y determines the number of initial conditions: G(n + x + 1, n - e*n + e*x - e + 1) = 2^x for x = 0, 1, ..., s. In addition, there is one more initial condition: G(n, e*n) = 1.
%C A141069 The "index of asymmetry" s = y also determines the order of the recurrence (which is probably s + 2 = y + 2): G(n + s + 2, k) = G(n + 1, k - e*s + e - 1) + Sum_{1 <= m <= s + 1} G(n + m, k - e*s + m*e - 2*e).
