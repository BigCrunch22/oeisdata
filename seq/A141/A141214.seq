%N A141214 Defining A to be the interior angle of a regular polygon, the number of constructible regular polygons such that A is in a field extension <= degree 2^n, starting with n=0. This is also the number of values of x such that phi(x)/2 is a power of 2 <= 2^n (where phi is Euler's phi function), also starting with n=0.
%F A141214 For 0<n<=31 (n+1)(n+6)/2 For n>=31 34n-462 The formulas are identical when n=31 f(31)=592
%e A141214 For degree 2^0, there are 3 polygons of sides 3, 4 & 6.
%e A141214 For degree 2^1, there are 4 polygons of sides 5, 8, 10 & 12.
%e A141214 For degree 2^2 there are 5 (15, 16, 20, 24 & 30).
%e A141214 For n<=31, for degree 2^n, there are n+3 polygons.
%e A141214 For n>= 31 there are 34 polygons.
%e A141214 Assuming there are only 5 Fermat primes, this is the value of the sum 3+4+5+... up to 31 (and 32) terms, after which each term is 34.
%Y A141214 The first 32 terms are identical to A055998 and A027379.
