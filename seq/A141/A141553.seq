%N A141553 Transformed nonprime products of prime factors of the composites, the largest prime decremented by 2 and the smallest prime incremented by 1.
%C A141553 In the prime number decomposition of k=A002808(i), i=1,2,3,.., one instance of the largest prime, pmax=A052369(i), is replaced by pmax-2 and one instance of the smallest prime, pmin=A056608(i), is replaced by pmin+1. If the product of this modified list of factors, k*(pmax-2)*(pmin+1)/(pmin*pmax), is nonprime, it is added to the sequence.
%e A141553 k(1)=(p(max)=2)*(p(min)=2), transformed (2-2)*(2+1)=0*3=0=a(1).
%e A141553 k(2)=(p(max)=3)*(p(min)=2), transformed (3-2)*(2+1)=1*3=3 (prime, skipped).
%e A141553 k(3)=(p(max)=2)*(p=2)*(p(min)=2), transformed (2-2)*2*(2+1)=0*2*3=0=a(2), etc.
