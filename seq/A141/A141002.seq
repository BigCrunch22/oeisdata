%N A141002 a(n) = total number of different ways a grasshopper can take n hops.
%C A141002 Consider a grasshopper (cf. A141000) that starts at x=0 at time 0, then makes successive hops of sizes 1, 2, 3, ..., n, subject to the constraint that it must always land on a point x >= 0; sequence gives number of different ways that it can make n hops.
%C A141002 Here, unlike A141000, there is no restriction on how large x can be (of course x <= n(n+1)/2).
%H A141002 David W. Wilson, <a href="/A141002/b141002.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..1000</a>
%e A141002 For example, for n=3 the grasshopper can hit 0=1+2-3 or 6=1+2+3; for n=4 it can hit 2=1+2+3-4, 4=1+2-3+4, or 10=1+2+3+4. For n=7 we can reach 8 in two different ways, which explains the first place where this sequence differs from A141001.
%Y A141002 Cf. A141000, A141001.
