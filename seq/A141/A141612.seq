%N A141612 Write down 0,1,2,3,...n each in binary. Total up the number of 1's in each bit-position (total number of 1's in 1's position, total number of 1's in 2's position, total number of 1's in 4's position, etc.). a(n) = the number of such totals that each do not equal any other such total.
%e A141612 For n= 9, we have (with leading zeros written) 0 through 9 in binary:
%e A141612 0000
%e A141612 0001
%e A141612 0010
%e A141612 0011
%e A141612 0100
%e A141612 0101
%e A141612 0110
%e A141612 0111
%e A141612 1000
%e A141612 1001
%e A141612 The number of 1's in the ones position (the rightmost position) is 5. The number of 1's in the 2's position (second position from the right) is 4. The number of 1's in the 4's position is 4. The number of 1's in the 8's position (the leftmost position here) is 2. Now, the total 4 occurs twice. But the total 2 occurs once, as does the total 5. Since two totals occur once each, then a(9) = 2.
