%N A141813 Primitive RMS numbers: RMS numbers which are not the product of two smaller RMS numbers.
%C A141813 RMS numbers (see A140480) are numbers such that the RMS (Root Mean Square) of their divisors is an integer. If A and B both appear in A140480 and GCD(A,B)=1, then A*B is also in A140480. This sequence contains only those RMS numbers that are not a product of smaller RMS numbers.

%e A141813 The RMS Number 287 is not in the sequence because 287=7*41 and both 7 and 41 are RMS numbers.
