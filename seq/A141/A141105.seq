%N A141105 Upper Even Swappage of Upper Wythoff Sequence.
%C A141105 1. lim (1/n)*A141105(n) = 1 + tau.
%C A141105 2. Let S(n)=(1/2)*A141105(n). Is the complement of S equal to A035487?
%C A141105 3. Is A141105 = 1+A141106?
%C A141105 Both 2 and 3 are true.  These can be verified with the Walnut theorem-prover, using a synchronized Fibonacci automaton for the sequence.  This automaton accepts the Fibonacci (Zeckendorf) representation of n and x in parallel if and only if x = A141105(n). - _Jeffrey Shallit_, Jan 27 2024

%F A141105 Let a = (1,3,4,6,8,9,11,12,...) = A000201 = lower Wythoff sequence; let b = (2,5,7,10,13,15,18,...) = A001950 = upper Wythoff sequence. For each odd b(n), let a(m) be the greatest number in a such that after swapping b(n) and a(m), the resulting new a and b are both increasing. A141105 is the sequence obtained by thus swapping all odds out of A001950.
%F A141105 a(n) = round(n*tau^2), with tau = (1+sqrt(5))/2 (the golden ratio A001622).
