%N A141058 Pats by first entry.
%C A141058 T(n,k) is the number of pats on [0,n] with first entry k. Pats are defined recursively in the Oakley/Wisner reference. Briefly, a one-entry permutation is a pat and a two-or-more-entry permutation p on any set of integers is a pat iff (i) there is a unique way to split p as the concatenation of nonempty permutations p_1 and p_2 such that all entries in p_1 exceed all entries in p_2, and (ii) reverse(p1) and reverse(p2) are pats. Thus 21 and 43 are pats but 12 is not and p = 3412 is a pat using p1 = 34 and p2 = 12. Pats on [1,n+1] (considered by Oakley/Wisner in the definition of flexagons) correspond to pats on [0,n] by subtracting 1 from each entry.
%C A141058 Also, pats on [0,n] with last entry k correspond to pats with first entry n-k under the reverse-complement operation on permutations.
