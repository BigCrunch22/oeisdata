%N A141090 Integral quotients of products of first k consecutive composites divided by their sums: products (dividends).
%C A141090 Based on A141092.
%C A141090 Compare with A140761 A159578 A140763 A116536.
%C A141090 Take the first k composite numbers. If their product divided by their sum results in an integer, their product is a term of the sequence. - _Harvey P. Dale_, Apr 29 2018

%F A141090 Find the products and sums of first k consecutive composites. When the product divided by the sum produces an integral quotient, add product to sequence.
%e A141090 a(3) = 2903040 because 4*6*8*9*10*12*14 = 2903040 and 4+6+8+9+10+12+14 = 63; 2903040/63 = 46080, integral -- 2903040 is added to the sequence.
