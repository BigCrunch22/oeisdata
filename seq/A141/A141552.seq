%N A141552 Transformed products of prime factors of the composites, the largest prime and smallest prime incremented by 1.
%C A141552 In the prime number decomposition of k=A002808(i), i=1,2,3,.., one instance of the largest prime, pmax=A052369(i), is replaced by pmax+1 and one instance of the smallest prime, pmin=A056608(i), is replaced by pmin+1. The product of this modified list of factors, k*(pmax+1)*(pmin+1)/(pmin*pmax), is added to the sequence.
%e A141552 k(1)=4=(p(max)=2)*(p(min)=2), transformed (2+1)*(2+1)=3*3=9=a(1).
%e A141552 k(2)=6=(p(max)=3)*(p(min)=2), transformed (3+1)*(2+1)=4*3=12=a(2).
%e A141552 k(6)=12=(p(max)=3)*(p=2)*(p(min)=2), transformed (3+1)*2*(2+1)=4*2*3=24=a(6), etc.
