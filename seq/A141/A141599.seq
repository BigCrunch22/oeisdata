%N A141599 Number of difference sets for permutations of [2n] with distinct differences.
%C A141599 Number of all-interval rows for systems with 2n notes in the octave (2n-edo).
%C A141599 As determined by direct enumeration up to n=6, a(n) is the number of circular permutations of the integers from 0 to 2n-1 in which all "stepping-on" sequences terminate and one is complete. For example, 07531642 is one of the 24 such permutations for n=4, as starting at 1 and moving to the right by the number of steps indicated gives the complete sequence 1, 6, 3, 4, 5, 2, 7, 0. - _Ian Duff_, Oct 07 2018
%C A141599 No permutations of the integers from 0 to 2n can generate such a complete sequence. - _Ian Duff_, Dec 25 2018
