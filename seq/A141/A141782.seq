%N A141782 Number of connected graphs with one cycle of length m = n-4 and n nodes.
%C A141782 We have unicyclic graphs of order n = m+4 with a cycle of length m. Only 4 nodes of those graphs belong to the rooted trees attached to the cycle, so the orders of those trees can be only 1,2,3,4, or 5. The set of graphs can be divided in five subsets S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4 and S_5, such that
%C A141782 S_1 has trees of orders [5,1,1,...,1],
%C A141782 S_2 has trees of orders [4,2,1,...,1],
%C A141782 S_3 has trees of orders [3,3,1,...,1],
%C A141782 S_4 has trees of orders [3,2,2,1,...,1] and
%C A141782 S_5 has trees of orders [2,2,2,2,1,...,1].
%C A141782 |S_1| = 9 since there are 9 rooted trees with 5 points.
%C A141782 |S_2| = 4floor(m/2).
%C A141782 |S_3| = 3floor(m/2). We consider the 3 2-combinations (with repetition) of the 2 distinct rooted trees of order 3.
%C A141782 |S_4| = 2floor((m-1)^2/4) since floor((m-1)^2/4) is the number of bracelets with m beads, 2 of which are red, 1 of which is blue.
%C A141782 With x=m-4, |S_5| = <(x^3 +9x^2 +(32-9(x mod 2))x)/48 +0.6>. The value of |S_5| is equal to the number of m-bead bracelets with 4 red beads.
%C A141782 This sequence is the fifth column of table T of A058879.
