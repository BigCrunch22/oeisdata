%N A141807 Numbers k such that the maximal prime power divisors of k form a run of integers.
%C A141807 Old name and expanded definition: If p^b(n,p) is the largest power of the prime p to divide n, then the positive integer n is included in the sequence if p(1)^b(n,p(1)) = p(2)^b(n,p(2))+1 = p(3)^b(n,p(3))+2 =...= p(k)^b(n,p(k))+k-1, where (p(1),p(2),p(3),...,p(k)) is some permutation of the distinct primes that divide n.
%C A141807 All prime powers (A000961) are included in this sequence.
%C A141807 Sequence A141808 consists of the terms of this sequence that are not prime powers.

%e A141807 The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^1. Since 5^1 = 2^2 + 1 = 3^1 + 2 (i.e., the prime powers, in some order, occur in an arithmetic progression with a difference of 1 between consecutive terms), then 60 is included in the sequence.
