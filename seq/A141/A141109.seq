%N A141109 Even numbers 2n such that for every prime p in [n,2n-2], 2n-p is also prime.
%C A141109 The Deshouillers et al. paper proves that 210 is the last term. This sequence is the same as 2*A002271, but why?
%H A141109 Jean-Marc Deshouillers, Andrew Granville, Wladyslaw Narkiewicz and Carl Pomerance, <a href="http://www.dms.umontreal.ca/~andrew/PDF/GoldbachII.pdf">An upper bound in Goldbach's problem</a>, Math. Comp. 61 (1993), 209-213.
%e A141109 30 is in this sequence because the primes p between 15 and 28 are {17,19,23} and 30-p is {13,11,7}.
