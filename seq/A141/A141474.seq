%N A141474 Concatenated and flattened output distributions of the Turing machines described in the comments lines.
%C A141474 As defined by Delahaye and Zenil, the function D(n) is the linear concatenation of the output distribution of all the binary strings produced by all n-state 2-symbol Turing machines from an empty tape before halting (non-halting machines are dismissed).
%C A141474 The output strings are grouped and ordered by frequency, from high to less, or lexicographical if the strings had the same frequency. D(n) as a function from n, the number of states of the Turing machines, to D(n) the output distribution of all n-state Turing machines, is evidently non-computable, but we have computed D(n) up to n=4.
%C A141474 However, lower bounds can be calculated for few states. Here we provide the sequence D(n) up to n=3. The properties of this function are similar to the properties of Sigma(n) and S(n) as defined for the busy beaver problem, for which values are also known up to n=4.
%C A141474 It is followed the same standard formalism of Turing machines followed in the busy beaver competition, namely Turing machines with a single bidirectional unbounded tape with a head able to write 0 or 1 and move to the left or to the right (or none if halted).

%F A141474 D(n) = S(T(n),i) with i the index of the n-state Turing machine from 1 to [4n+2]^(2n), S the output frequency distribution sorting the outputs from high to less frequency and n the number of states of the Turing machine from n=1 to infinity. The number of Turing machines for n = {1, 2, 3, 4} is therefore: {36, 10000, 7529536, 11019960576}
%e A141474 a(1) = 0 and a(2) = 1 because out of twelve 1-state 2-symbol Turing machines that halt, six produce the string 0 and the other six produce the string 1. a(5) = 0 because it is the first bit of the third most frequent string produced by one of the 3044 2-state 2-symbol Turing machines that halt.
