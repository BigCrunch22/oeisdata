%N A141529 A cyclotomic Binet solution for the first 11 primes: solution of a set of linear equations with cyclotomic polynomial roots; roots: r[i]->(x^11-1): a(n)=Sum[r(i)^n*c(i),{i,1,11}].

%C A141529 Terence Tao and Ben Green proved there are polynomials of arbitrary length that generate Primes. Let us assume that they are right, that the primes are represented in an algebraic polynomial of a recursive sequence:
%C A141529 a[n]=Prime[j];
%C A141529 a[n]=Sum[a[n-k]*b[k],{k=1,m}]
%C A141529 which has a Binet function solution of:
%C A141529 f[n]=Sum[r[i]^n*c[i],{i,1.m}]
%C A141529 The classical number theory gives sum of the coefficients at n=0:
%C A141529 f[0]=Sum[c[i],{i,1,m}]=2
%C A141529 which is in Fibonacci terms a "Lucas" type.
%C A141529 But if the primes are a graph substitution generated sequence with this same generating polynomial then:
%C A141529 f[0]=Sum[c[i],{i,1,m}]=0
%C A141529 and the primes are Fibonacci like.
%C A141529 The real matter here is the algebraicness and the limit:
%C A141529 from Markov type theory of algebraic sequences
%C A141529 Limit[a[n+1]/a[n],n->Infinity]= Maxroot[r[i]]
%C A141529 Let's call that the algebraic root:
%C A141529 Limit[a[n+1]/a[n],n->Infinity]=1+d
%C A141529 such that:
%C A141529 Prime[n+1]=(1+d)*Prime[n]
%C A141529 or
%C A141529 Prime[n+1]=Prime[n]+2*Gap[n]
%C A141529 which gives:
%C A141529 d=2*Gap[n]/Prime[n]
%C A141529 and the classical value of the limit is:
%C A141529 Limit[d,n->Infinity]=0
%C A141529 That being true the limiting algebraic polynomial of the primes is a p-adic cyclotomic:
%C A141529 p[x,Prime[n]]=(x^Prime[n]-1)/(x-1)
%C A141529 with the root structure:
%C A141529 r[m]=Exp[2*Pi*I*m/Prime[n]]
%C A141529 Since the roots are equally spaced on the unit circle
%C A141529 in the complex plane:
%C A141529 Limit[Sum[Exp[2*Pi*I*m/Prime[n]],{m,1, Prime[n]}],{n->Infinity]=0
%C A141529 So if the polynomial of arbitrary length is algebraic that generates the primes and if their classical ratio of one holds, then the zeroth Binet prime is zero:
%C A141529 Limit[Sum[c[m]*Exp[2*Pi*I*m/Prime[n]],{m,1, Prime[n]}],{n->Infinity]=0
%C A141529 The primes are Fibonacci like and not Lucas like. It is possible to "arrange" the c[m] is such a way that:
%C A141529 Limit[Sum[c[m]*Exp[2*Pi*I*m/Prime[n]],{m,1,Prime[n]}],{n->Infinity]=Integer
%C A141529 but that appears "artificial" from this point of view.
%C A141529 I came to this conclusion when studying to learn Ring and scheme theory in algebraic geometry.
%C A141529 The ring of the primes is defined with an additive zero in the spec definition: you can't have a ring without it.
%C A141529 For a field of primes, a "1" term is also necessary.
%C A141529 The classical number theory with 2 as the starting element says that the primes can't be the backbone of the Integer field that they are.
%C A141529 That classical definition is here proved wrong.
%C A141529 In terms of modern theory of the Grothendieck sort/ algebraic geometry, zero has to be a prime and the zeroth prime.
