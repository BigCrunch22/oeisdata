%N A141045 Triangle of subsequences of A140825 with a mirror symmetry.
%C A141045 The triangle shows A140825(3) in the first row and fills the n-th row by successively skipping two terms of A140825 and taking the next n terms. The absolute values of the triangle generated this way are symmetric with respect to mirror-operation at the row centers. We are essentially reading numerators down columns of the triangle in A140825, a(i,j), 0<=i<=j-2.
%e A141045 The triangle starts:
%e A141045 -1;
%e A141045 1, -1;
%e A141045 -19, 11, -19;
%e A141045 27, -11, 11, -27;
