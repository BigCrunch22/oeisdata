%N A141808 Numbers k such that the maximal prime power divisors of k form a nontrivial run of integers.
%C A141808 Old name and expanded definition: If p^b(n,p) is the largest power of the prime p to divide n, then the positive integer non-prime-power n is included in the sequence if p(1)^b(n,p(1)) = p(2)^b(n,p(2))+1 = p(3)^b(n,p(3))+2 = ... = p(k)^b(n, p(k))+k-1, where (p(1),p(2),p(3),...,p(k)) is some permutation of the distinct primes that divide n.
%C A141808 Sequence A141807 is the union of the prime powers (A000961) and this sequence.
%C A141808 Terms with two distinct prime factors occur where either 2^m+1 or 2^m-1 is a prime power. Terms with three distinct prime factors (60, 504) occur where both 2^m+1 and 2^m-1 are prime powers. There are no terms with more than three distinct prime factors. For every Mersenne prime p (A000668), p*(p+1) is in this sequence. For every prime p in A000043, 2^p*(2^p-1) is in this sequence. - _Ray Chandler_, Jun 21 2009
%e A141808 The prime factorization of 60 is 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^1. Since 60 is not a prime power and since 5^1 = 2^2 + 1 = 3^1 + 2 (i.e., the prime powers, in some order, occur in an arithmetic progression with a difference of 1 between consecutive terms), 60 is included in the sequence.
