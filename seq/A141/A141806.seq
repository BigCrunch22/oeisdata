%e A141806 1072 is the sum of two distinct nonzero cubes in exactly one way: 1072 = 7^3 + 9^3. 9 is not in A031980, so 1072 is not the sum of cubes of two distinct earlier terms of A031980 and hence 1072 is in A031980. Therefore 1072 is in not in A141805 and so a term of this sequence.
%e A141806 1729 is the sum of two distinct nonzero cubes in exactly two ways: 1729 = 9^3 + 10^3 = 1^3 + 12^3. 1 and 12 are in A031980, so 1729 is the sum of cubes of two distinct earlier terms of A031980 and hence 1729 is in not A031980. Therefore 1729 is in A141805 and so not a term of this sequence.
%Y A141806 Cf. A024670, A141805, A031980 (smallest number not occurring earlier and not the sum of cubes of two distinct earlier terms).
