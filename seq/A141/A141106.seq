%N A141106 Lower Odd Swappage of Upper Wythoff Sequence.
%C A141106 1. lim (1/n)*A141106(n) = 1 + tau.
%C A141106 2. Let S(n)=(1/2)*(1+A141106(n)). Is the complement of S equal to A035487?
%C A141106 #2 is true.  This can be proved using a synchronized automaton for A035487 and A141106.  These automata take the Fibonacci (Zeckendorf) representations of n and y in parallel, and accept if and only if y = a(n). - _Jeffrey Shallit_, Jan 27 2024

%F A141106 Let a = (1,3,4,6,8,9,11,12,...) = A000201 = lower Wythoff sequence; let b = (2,5,7,10,13,15,18,...) = A001950 = upper Wythoff sequence. For each even b(n), let a(m) be the least number in a such that after swapping b(n) and a(m), the resulting new a and b are both increasing. A141106 is the sequence obtained by thus swapping all evens out of A001950.
