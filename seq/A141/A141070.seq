%N A141070 Number of primes in rows of Pascal-like triangles with index of asymmetry y = 3 and index of obliquity z = 0 or z = 1.
%C A141070 For the Pascal-like triangle G(n, k) with index of asymmetry y = 3 and index of obliqueness z = 0, which is read by rows, we have G(n, 0) = G(n+1, n+1) = 1, G(n+2, n+1) = 2, G(n+3, n+1) = 4, G(n+4, n+1) = 8, and G(n+5, k) = G(n+1, k-1) + G(n+1, k) + G(n+2, k) + G(n+3, k) + G(n+4, k) for n >= 0 and k = 1..(n+1). (This is array A140996.)
%C A141070 For the Pascal-like triangle with index of asymmetry y = 3 and index of obliqueness z = 1, which is read by rows, we have G(n, n) = G(n+1, 0) = 1, G(n+2, 1) = 2, G(n+3, 2) = 4, G(n+4, 3) = 8, and G(n+5, k) = G(n+1, k-3) + G(n+1, k-4) + G(n+2, k-3) + G(n+3, k-2) + G(n+4, k-1) for n >= 0 and k = 4..(n+4). (This is array A140995.)
%C A141070 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jun 13 2019: (Start)
%C A141070 The two triangular arrays A140995 and A140996, which are described above, are mirror images of each other. Thus, we get the same sequence no matter which one we use.
%C A141070 Even though the numbering of the rows of both triangular arrays A140995 and A140996 starts at n = 0, the author of this sequence set up the offset at n = 1; that is, a(n) = number of primes in row n - 1 for A140995 (or for A140996) for n >= 1.
%C A141070 Finally, we mention that in the attached picture about Stepan's triangles, the letter s is used to describe the index of asymmetry and the letter e is used to describe the index of obliqueness (instead of the letters y and z, respectively).

%e A141070 Pascal-like triangle with y = 3 and z = 0 (i.e, A140996) begins as follows:
%e A141070   1, so a(1) = 0.
%e A141070   1 1, so a(2) = 0.
%e A141070   1 2 1, so prime 2 and a(3) = 1.
%e A141070   1 4 2 1, so prime 2 and a(4) = 1.
%e A141070   1 8 4 2 1, so prime 2 and a(5) = 1.
%e A141070   1 16 8 4 2 1, so prime 2 and a(6) = 1.
%e A141070   1 31 17 8 4 2 1, so primes 2, 17, 31 and a(7) = 3.
%e A141070   1 60 35 17 8 4 2 1, so primes 2, 17 and a(8) = 2.
