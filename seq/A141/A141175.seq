%N A141175 Duplicate of A007522.
%C A141175 Original title was "Primes of the form -x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2 (as well as of the form 7x^2 + 12xy + 4y^2)."
%C A141175 _R. J. Mathar_ was the first to wonder if this entry is a duplicate. By elementary means, I very easily proved that all primes of this form are also of the form 8n + 7 (which is A007522). Then _Don Reble_ demonstrated that each prime of the form 8n + 7 has a corresponding representation as -x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2. Therefore the two sequences are in fact the same. - _Alonso del Arte_, Nov 21 2016
