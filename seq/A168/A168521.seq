%N A168521 Sort numbers by value of sum of squares of prime factors (cf. A067666). Break ties by putting smaller numbers first. Begin with 0, 1.
%C A168521 Represent each number m by a corresponding point, P_m, in Euclidean space, such that the prime factors of m are the co-ordinates of P_m. In this sequence, the numbers appear in order of distance from the origin of their corresponding points.

%F A168521 For n >= 2, Sum_{k=1..A001222(a(n))} A027746(a(n),k)^2 <= Sum_{k=1..A001222(a(n+1))} A027746(a(n+1),k)^2. - _Peter Munn_, Aug 17 2022
%e A168521 For m = 7, distance d from the origin of P_7 is 7, for m = 8192 (P_8192 = [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]) d = sqrt(13*2^2) = 7.211102550927978. So 7 appears before 8192.

%E A168521 It would also be worthwhile computing the companion sequence where ties are broken according to lexicographic order of the lists of prime factors (so that 48 would come before 5, instead of after). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 29 2009
