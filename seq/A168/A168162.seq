%N A168162 Numbers n which do not exceed the sum of the binary digits in all primes <= n.
%C A168162 The sequence A168161 is a subsequence of the primes in this sequence.
%F A168162 A168162 = { n | n <= A095375(pi(n)) }, where pi(n) = A000720(n).
%e A168162 There is no prime <= 1 and 2 has only nonzero binary digit, therefore these numbers are not in the sequence.
%e A168162 However, a(1)=3 has two binary digits, so the total number of these equal 3.
%e A168162 Then, 4 is larger than this, but the prime p=5 again adds 2 nonzero binary digits adding to a total of 5=a(2).
%e A168162 Then 6 is larger than this, but the prime p=7 adds 3 more nonzero bits for a total of 8, such that a(3)=7 and a(4)=8 don't exceed this.
