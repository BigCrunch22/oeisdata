%N A008686 Day-of-month at weekly intervals from Jan 01 of a non-leap year.
%C A008686 Currently the starting year is not fixed and therefore the continuation of the sequence becomes ambiguous when terms correspond to a time beyond the month of February of the second year (which could be a leap year, or not). If the starting year is made precise, for example 1901, then the sequence could be extended to range over a century or more. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 24 2023
