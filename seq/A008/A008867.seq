%N A008867 Triangle of truncated triangular numbers: k-th term in n-th row is number of dots in hexagon of sides k, n-k, k, n-k, k, n-k.
%C A008867 Closely related to A109439. The current sequence is made of truncated triangular numbers, the latter gives the full description. Both can help to build a cube with layers perpendicular to the great diagonal. E.g.: 15,18,19,18,15 in A008867 is a truncation of the lesser triangular numbers of 1,3,6,10,15,18,19,18,15,10,6,3,1 in A109439. - M. Dauchez (mdzzdm(AT)yahoo.fr), Sep 02 2005
%C A008867 The sequence is a triangle read by rows where the n-th row is obtained by multiplying by (1/3)*(n+1)*(2*(n+1)^2+1) the first row of the limit as k approaches infinity of P(n)^k where P(n) is the stochastic matrix associated with a variant of the Ehrenfest model using n balls. The elements of the stochastic matrix P(n) we have considered are given by P(n)[i,j] = n+1-(max(i,j)-min(i,j)), where each row must be normalized using the L1 norm and where i,j belong to the set {0,1,2,...,n}. They are defined as the probabilities of arriving in a state j given the previous state i. In particular the sum of every row of a stochastic matrix must be 1, and so the sum of the terms of the n-th row of this triangle is (1/3)*(n+1)*(2*(n+1)^2+1) (since the limit of a stochastic matrix is again a stochastic matrix). Furthermore, by the properties of Markov chains, we can interpret P(n)^k as the k-step transition matrix of this variant of the Ehrenfest model using n balls. It is important to note that the rows of the limit of the stochastic matrix are identical and since we know the first we know all the others. - _Luca Onnis_, Oct 29 2023
