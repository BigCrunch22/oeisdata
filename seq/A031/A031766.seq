%N A031766 Numbers k such that the least term in the periodic part of the continued fraction for sqrt(k) is 88.
%C A031766 From _Chai Wah Wu_, Nov 07 2016: (Start)
%C A031766 If r is even, then the least term of the continued fraction of (r*m/2)^2+m is r for all m >= 1. On the other hand, the least term of the continued fraction of r^4/4 + r^3 + 2r^2 + 3r+2 is also r but it is not of the form (r*m/2)^2+m.
%C A031766 If r is odd, then the least term of the continued fraction of (r*m)^2+2m is r for all m >= 1 and the least term of the continued fraction of r^4 + r^3 + 5*(r+1)^2/4 is also r but it is not of the form (r*m)^2+2m.
%C A031766 This means that 1936*m^2 + m are terms of the sequence for all m >= 1 and 15689610 is also a term but not of the form 1936*m^2 + m.
