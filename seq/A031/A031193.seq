%N A031193 Numbers having period-22 5-digitized sequences.
%C A031193 This sequence consists of those n whose trajectory under the "sum of fifth power of digits" function has period 22. All elements are multiples of 3, but some multiples of 3, the least being 0 and 888, are not in the sequence. - _David W. Wilson_, Aug 03 2005
%C A031193 Multiples of 3 have period 22 (like 3), period 1 (like 888), or period 2 (like 38889). The absence of 888 from this sequence is enough to demonstrate that it is not a Beatty sequence. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jan 27 2022
