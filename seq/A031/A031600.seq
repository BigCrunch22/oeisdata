%N A031600 Numbers k such that the continued fraction for sqrt(k) has odd period and if the last term of the periodic part is deleted the two central terms are both 12.
%e A031600 CF(sqrt(145)) = (12, (24)), therefore 145 is not in the sequence.
%e A031600 CF(sqrt(1049)) = (32, (2,1,1,2,1,4,3,1,5,7,1,12, 12,1,7,5,1,3,4,1,2,1,1,2, 64)), therefore 1049 is in the sequence.
