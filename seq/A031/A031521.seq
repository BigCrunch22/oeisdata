%N A031521 Numbers k such that the continued fraction for sqrt(k) has even period and if the last term of the periodic part is deleted the central term is 23.
%C A031521 The "central term" is the term that appears at 1/2 the length of the period of the continued fraction. - _Harvey P. Dale_, Feb 25 2012
