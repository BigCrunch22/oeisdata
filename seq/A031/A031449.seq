%e A031449 13 in binary is 1101, which has three 1's but only one 0, hence 13 is in the sequence.
%e A031449 14 in binary is 1110, which has three 1's but only one 0, hence 14 is in the sequence.
%e A031449 15 in binary is 1111, which has four 1's but no significant 0's, hence 15 is not in the sequence.

%Y A031449 Cf. A007088, A023416, A080791 (these two sequences are identical except for a(0), which is irrelevant for this sequence because 0 has no 1's).
