%N A123193 Natural numbers with number of divisors equal to a Fibonacci number.
%C A123193 Does not contain (for example) 180, so is different from A000028. - _Max Alekseyev_, Sep 20 2007
%C A123193 How dense is this sequence? There are 7 members up to 10^1, 42 up to 10^2, 364 up to 10^3, 3379 up to 10^4, 31864 up to 10^5, 303623 up to 10^6, 2907125 up to 10^7, 27893864 up to 10^8, and 268099330 up to 10^9. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Sep 16 2015
%C A123193 Partial answer: a(n) << n log n/(log log n)^k for any k. Proof: Since 0 is a Fibonacci number, and Fibonacci numbers are periodic mod any number, 2^(k+1) divides infinitely many Fibonacci numbers. Take some positive Fibonacci number F divisible by 2^(k+1). By Landau's theorem there are >> x (log log x)^k/log x odd squarefree numbers divisible by k+1 primes up to x. Multiply each by 2^(F/2^(k+1)-1) which leaves the density unchanged since the expression is constant in k, and note that the products have exactly F divisors. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Sep 16 2015
