%N A123694 a(n) gives the A089840-index of the nonrecursive Catalan automorphism which is formed from A089840[n] by applying it to the left subtree of a binary tree and leaving the right-hand side subtree intact.
%C A123694 If the count of fixed points of the automorphism A089840[n] is given by sequence f, then the count of fixed points of the automorphism A089840[A123694(n)] is given by CONV(f,A000108) (where CONV stands for convolution). See also the comments at A122200.

%e A123694 When A089840[1] = A069770 (swap binary tree sides) is applied to the left subtree of a binary tree, we get A089840[7] = A089854, thus a(1)=7. When A089840[12] = A074679 is applied to the left subtree of a binary tree, we get A089840[4207] = A089865, thus a(12)=4207.
