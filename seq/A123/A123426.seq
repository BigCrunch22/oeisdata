%N A123426 Number of Hoang perfect graphs on n nodes.
%C A123426 A graph is called Hoang if its wing graph is bipartite. The wing graph W(G) of a graph G has as its vertices the edges of G and two edges are adjacent in W(G) if   there is an induced P4 in G that has these two edges as its ends. - _Falk Hüffner_, Jun 30 2018
