%N A123234 Number of n X n Latin squares up to row and column permutation (or "RC-equivalence").

%C A123234 "It would be possible to find the counts for n=9 and n=10 using the method of my paper in JCD [see link below]. For n=10 it is probably a 24-digit number. I'll explain the method I used. See the paper above for terminology.
%C A123234 "Is(L) is the autotopism group. Also define the group RC(L) of all autotopisms for which the symbols component is the identity. For any Latin square L we have:
%C A123234 "The isotopy class containing L contains (n!)^3/|Is(L)| squares.
%C A123234 "The RC-equivalence class containing L contains (n!)^2/|RC(L)| squares.
%C A123234 "If L and L' are isotopic then |RC(L)| = |RC(L')|. Therefore the number of RC-equivalence classes in the isotopy class of L is n!*|RC(L)|/|Is(L)|. I modified an existing program slightly to find |RC(L)|/|Is(L)|. and applied it to one square from each isotopy class. The sum of n!*|RC(L)|/|Is(L)| is the total number of RC-equivalence classes.

%e A123234 The first square is transformed by permuting columns; the 2nd square is transformed by permuting rows.
%e A123234 Both the first and 3rd square are in reduced form, so are considered equivalent by row/col permutation.
