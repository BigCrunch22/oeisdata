%N A123466 Write the positive integer n in binary. Subdivide the binary n into runs each consisting entirely of 0's or of 1's, where the runs alternate between those of 1's and those of 0's. The sequence gives those numbers n such that there is at least one run of 1's of the same length as at least one run of 0's.

%e A123466 25 written in binary is 11001. The runs are (11)(00)(1). Since at least one run of 1's (the leftmost run here) is the same length as at least one run of 0's (the only run of 0's here), 25 is included in this sequence.
