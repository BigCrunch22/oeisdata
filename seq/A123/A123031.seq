%N A123031 Array read by antidiagonals: row i (i>=0) contains those positive integers n >= 2 for which the multiset { n mod k : k=2,3,...,n } contains exactly one copy of i.
%C A123031 In other words, for i >= 1, the i-th row contains all numbers n>2i such that n-i does not have divisors d with i < d < n-i. If p is the smallest prime divisor of n-i then (n-i)/p <= i.
%C A123031 Alternatively, the i-th row (i>=1) consists of 2i+1 and positive integers n>2i+1 such that the smallest prime divisor of n-i is greater than or equal to (n-i)/i = n/i - 1.
%e A123031 For example, the 0th row obviously contains all prime numbers.
