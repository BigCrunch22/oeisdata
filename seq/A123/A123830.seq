%N A123830 Number of ways to build a contiguous building with n LEGO blocks of size 2 X 4 on top of a fixed block of the same size.
%C A123830 The base block is not counted among the n and must be the only block in the bottom layer of the building.
%F A123830 a(n) >= 46^n.
%e A123830 From _Matthias Simon_, Aug 16 2018: (Start)
%e A123830 Explanation to a(1): There is a 2 X 4 LEGO block fixed at the ground. There are 46 ways to put a building consisting of n=1 LEGO block onto the fixed block, because:
%e A123830 1) For n=1, the figure is just another LEGO block.
%e A123830 2) If the two LEGO blocks are parallel, the upper LEGO block can be shifted in 3*7 = 21 different ways relatively to the lower one.
%e A123830 3) If the LEGO blocks are in a right angle to each other, the upper LEGO block can be shifted in 5*5 = 25 different ways relatively to the lower one.
%e A123830 4) Summing up: a(1) = 21 + 25 = 46.
%e A123830 Explanations to a(2): Two additional LEGO blocks are added to a fixed one. The first additional block is put onto the fixed one, the second additional block ...
%e A123830 a) ... may also be put onto the fixed block (if there are free studs)
%e A123830 b) ... or may be put onto the first additional block.
%e A123830 Following a), 480 figures can be obtained.
%e A123830 Following b), 46^2 = 2116 figures can be obtained.
%e A123830 Summing up: a(2) = 480 + 2116 = 2596.
