%N A123481 Record n for the sequence A006666(n)/log(n), for n > 1; i.e., the n at which the number of steps to 1 for the halving-Collatz iteration divided by log(n) sets a new maximum.
%C A123481 These numbers (for n > 2, at least) are called "Abby-Normal" numbers by Dominici in the referenced paper (definition 21); 2 is included here to agree with the RECORDS transform convention. - _D. S. McNeil_, Mar 26 2009
%C A123481 Three further terms are known (see Roosendaal) but they may not be the next three terms. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Oct 21 2012
