%N A123298 Number of incongruent restricted disjoint covering systems (IRDCS) of length n.
%C A123298 An IRDCS of length n is a sequence of n integers s(1),...,s(n) with the property that if s(i)=m for some m then the other terms of the sequence with value m are precisely s(i+k*m) for all k such that i+k*m is in [1,n] and further such that any integer appearing in the sequence appears at least twice. For example, the two IRDCS of length n are 6,9,3,4,5,3,6,4,3,5,9 and its reverse.
