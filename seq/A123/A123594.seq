%N A123594 Unique sequence of 0's and 1's which are either repeated or not repeated with the following property: when the sequence is 'coded' in writing down a 1 when an element is repeated and a 0 when it is not repeated and by putting the initial element in front of the sequence thus obtained, the above sequence appears.
