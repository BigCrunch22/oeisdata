%e A123060 a(1) = 1 since Roman(1) = I and 1(base 1) have the same (1) number of characters.
%e A123060 a(4) = 3 since Roman(4) = IV and 11(base 3) have the same (2) number of characters.
%e A123060 a(8) = 2 since Roman(8) = VIII and 1000(base 2) have the same (4) number of characters.
%e A123060 a(10) = 11 since Roman(10) = X and X(base 11) have the same (1) number of characters.

%e A123060 a(17) = 0 because Roman(17) = XVII has 4 characters, while 17 = 10001(base 2) has 5 characters and 17 = 122(base 3) has 3 characters.
%e A123060 a(30) = 4 because Roman(30) = XXX has 3 characters, as do 110(base 5) and 132(base 4), but Min{4,5} = 4.
