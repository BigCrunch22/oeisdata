%N A123320 Table of the cycle lengths for "imperfect" (generalized) faro shuffles with cut of size k returning a deck of size n to its original order.
%C A123320 An "imperfect" (generalized) faro shuffle with cut of size k for a deck of size n is performed by first cutting the deck into a top pile of k cards and a bottom pile of n-k cards, performing a perfect faro shuffle on the bottomost min(k,n-k) cards of each pile and placing any remaining cards on top of the deck. (Thus k may range from 0 to n inclusive, hence the offset is 0). The central column T(2k,k) gives the "perfect" faro shuffle cycles A002326.
