%N A123757 a(0)=1. a(n) = sum of the earlier terms which are divisible by (the number of 1's in the binary representation of n).
%e A123757 9 in binary is 1001, which has 2 ones. So a(9) is the sum of terms, from a(0) to are divisible by 2. a(2)=2, a(3)=2, a(4)=6, a(5)=10, a(6)=20, a(7)=6 and a(8)=48 are the earlier terms which are divisible by 2. So a(9) = 2+2+6+10+20+6+48 = 94.
