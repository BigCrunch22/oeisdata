%N A123923 a(1)=1. a(n) = (highest term among first n-1 terms of sequence which divides n)-th integer from among those integers not occurring among the first n-1 terms of the sequence.
%C A123923 Sequence is likely a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A123923 3 is the largest integer which occurs among the first 5 terms of the sequence and which divides 6. So for a(6) we want the 3rd integer from among those positive integers not among the first 5 terms of the sequence (i.e. we want the 3rd integer from among 4,6,7,8,10,...). So a(6) = 7.
