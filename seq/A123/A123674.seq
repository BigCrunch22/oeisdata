%N A123674 a(n) = number of primes of the form 2^n - 3^k.
%C A123674 a(1) = 0 because there are no prime numbers of the form 2^1 - 3^k. a(2) = 1 because the only prime of the form 2^2 - 3^k is 2^2 - 3^0 = 3. a(3) = because there are two primes of the form 2^3 - 3^k: 2^3 - 3^0 = 7 and 2^3 - 3^1 = 5.
