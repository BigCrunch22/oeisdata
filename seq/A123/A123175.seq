%N A123175 Table (read by antidiagonals) where t(0,0)=1, t(m,n) = number of terms above and to the left of t(m,n) (i.e., number of t(k,j)'s, where 0 <= k <= m, 0 <= j <= n, excluding the t(m,n) case itself) which are coprime to (m+n).
%e A123175 The first 4 columns and first 6 rows (excluding t(5,3)) of the table are:
%e A123175   1,  1,  2,  3
%e A123175   1,  3,  4,  5
%e A123175   2,  4,  4, 10
%e A123175   3,  5, 10,  5
%e A123175   3,  8,  4, 19
%e A123175   5,  5, 17,
%e A123175 The number of these terms which are coprime to (5+3) is 14 (the odd terms).
%e A123175 So t(5, 3) = 14.
