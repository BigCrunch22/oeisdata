%C A123196 Old Name was: Jumping along the natural numbers, starting at the first prime and letting the greatest prime reached so far determine the length of the next jump, when "reached" is defined as "jumped over" as well as "landed on".
%C A123196 Note that the infinitude of this sequence follows from Bertrand's postulate.
%C A123196 From _David James Sycamore_, Apr 07 2017: (Start)
%C A123196 Among the first 500 terms, the primes are a(1)=2, a(3)=7, a(7)=97, a(107)=121474271192355984857330583869867, a(131), a(213), a(263), and a(363).
%C A123196 The underlying sequence of added primes is A075058 and A068524, without their first terms (1 & 2 respectively). (End)

%e A123196 a(1)=2 since 2 is the first prime. a(3)=7 since having landed at 4, the greatest prime reached so far is 3. a(8)=194=97+97 since with the preceding term we had landed on a prime. a(17)=98141 since having passed the prime 49069 with the term a(16) but not having reached the prime 49081, we have to add the former and indeed 98141=49069+49072.
