%N A123275 Square array A(n,m) = largest divisor of m which is coprime to n, read by upwards antidiagonals.
%C A123275 Read by upwards antidiagonals as A(1,1), A(2,1), A(1,2), A(3,1), A(2,2), A(1,3), etc.
%C A123275 Seen as a triangle, the rows appear to be the reversed rows of the regular triangle defined by t(n,k) = denominator(n*k/(n-k)) for n>=2 and 1<=k<n. - _Michel Marcus_, Mar 24 2022
