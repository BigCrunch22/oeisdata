%N A123756 a(0)=0. a(n) = number of earlier terms which are divisible by (the number of 1's in the binary representation of n).
%e A123756 9 in binary is 1001, which has 2 ones. So a(9) is the number of terms, from a(0) to a(8), which are divisible by 2. a(0)=0, a(2)=2, a(3)=2, a(4)=4, a(5)=4 and a(8)=8 are the six earlier terms which are divisible by 2. So a(9) = 6.
