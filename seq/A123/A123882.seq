%N A123882 a(1)=1, a(2)=2. a(n) = the smallest positive integer that does not occur earlier in the sequence and is coprime to the second-largest term occurring earlier in the sequence.
%C A123882 Sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A123882 From _Bob Selcoe_, Aug 12 2015: (Start)
%C A123882 Let z be the largest term already occurring in the sequence. Except for a(2), z is odd.
%C A123882 When n=z, the sequence is a permutation of the positive integers up to and including z.
%C A123882 Let p be the smallest prime number that is not a factor of z-1. When n>=3, z+1 is coprime to both z and z-1+p.
%C A123882 When n>=5, a(n) is the smallest positive integer not yet having occurred in the sequence that is coprime to a(n-1). (End)

%F A123882 For n>=5, where z and p are defined in "Comments":
%F A123882 a(n) = n-1, except for a(z+1) = z-1+p.
%F A123882 a(n) = a(n-1)+1, except for a(z+1) = a(z)+p and a(z+2) = a(z)+2 (here, p can also be defined as the smallest prime that is not a factor of a(z)). (End)
%e A123882 The second-largest integer among the first 8 terms of the sequence is 7. Those positive terms not occurring among the first 8 terms form the sequence 8,9,10,12,13,...; of these, 8 is the smallest that is coprime to 7. So a(9)=8.
%e A123882 z=43: a(44)=47 because the smallest prime not a factor of z-1 = 42 is 5, and 42+5 = 47. - _Bob Selcoe_, Aug 12 2015
