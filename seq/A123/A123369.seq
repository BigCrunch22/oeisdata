%N A123369 Number of prime divisors of n-th Conway and Guy second-order harmonic number (counted with multiplicity).
%C A123369 We must include multiplicity in the definition due to terms such as a(16) = 29889983 = 19 * 31^2 * 1637. The primes are those n for which a(n) = Omega(A027612(n))= 1, namely a(2) = 5, a(3) = 13, a(6) = 223, a(9) = 4861, a(18) = 197698279, a(25) = 25472027467. The semiprimes are those for which a(n) = 2, such as when n = 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 15, 19, 23, 24. The 3-almost primes are those for which a(n) = 3, as with the "3-brilliant" a(10) = 55991 = 13 * 59 * 73, a(14), a(17), a(21), a(22), a(26).
