%N A123690 Number of points in a square lattice covered by a circle of diameter n if the center of the circle is chosen such that the circle covers the maximum possible number of lattice points.
%C A123690 a(n) >= max(A053411(n), A053414(n), A053415(n)).
%C A123690 a(n) is an upper bound for the number of segments of a self avoiding path on the 2-dimensional square lattice such that the path fits into a circle of diameter n. A122224(n) <= a(n).
