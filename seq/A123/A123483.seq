%N A123483 Second order RecamÃ¡n's sequence: a(0) = 0; for n > 0, a(n) = a(n-1) - A005132(n) if that number is positive and not already in the sequence, otherwise a(n-1) + A005132(n).
%C A123483 I conjecture that this sequence contains every natural number. (Even though through n=10000, we still haven't seen 3; we are still occasionally seeing small numbers.) This sequence has an interesting graph.
%C A123483 The smallest n such that a(n) = 3, 6, 12 are, respectively, 4729925, 5808155, 2093396. The following numbers less than 100 do not appear in the sequence for n <= 10^7: 7, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 35, 39, 41, 44, 45, 57, 61, 65, 67, 70, 71, 73, 77, 87, 91, 95. - _Nick Hobson_, Feb 18 2007
