%N A123917 a(1)=1. a(n) = (the highest exponent in the prime-factorization of n)th integer from among those positive integers not occurring earlier in the sequence.
%C A123917 This sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A123917 12 has a prime-factorization of 2^2 *3^1 and the highest exponent is 2. So a(12) is the 2nd integer from among those positive integers not occurring among the first 11 terms of the sequence (i.e., the second integer from 12,13,14,...). So a(12) = 13.
