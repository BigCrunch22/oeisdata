%N A301807 Lexicographically first sequence of distinct integers whose concatenation of digits is the same as the concatenation of the digits of the absolute differences between consecutive terms.
%C A301807 This sequence might not be a permutation of A000027 (the positive numbers). After 18000 terms the smallest integer not yet present is 42. This 42 will perhaps never show.
%C A301807 From _RÃ©my Sigrist_, Jul 04 2018: (Start)
%C A301807 In fact, a(18420) = 42; however that this sequence is a permutation of the natural numbers remains an open question.
%C A301807 If we drop the unicity constraint, then we obtain A210025.
%C A301807 If moreover we impose that the sequence be nondecreasing, then we obtain A100787.

%e A301807 (The first members of the equalities hereunder must be seen as absolute differences between the successive pairs of adjacent terms:)
%e A301807     1 -  2 =  1
%e A301807     2 -  4 =  2
%e A301807     4 -  8 =  4
%e A301807     8 - 16 =  8
%e A301807    16 - 15 =  1
%e A301807    15 -  9 =  6
%e A301807     9 - 10 =  1
%e A301807    10 -  5 =  5
%e A301807     5 - 14 =  9
%e A301807    14 - 24 = 10
%e A301807    24 - 19 =  5
%e A301807    19 - 18 =  1, etc.
%e A301807 We see that the first and the last column present the same digit succession: 1, 2, 4, 8, 1, 6, 1, 5, 9, 1, 0, 5, 1, ...
%Y A301807 Cf. A301743 for the same idea with additions of adjacent terms instead of absolute differences.
%Y A301807 Cf. A100787, A210025.
