%N A301805 Number of ways to write 3*n^2 as x^2 + 10*y^2 + 2^z, where x, y and z are nonnegative integers with z > 3.
%C A301805 It might seem that a(n) > 0 for all n > 2. However, we find that a(323525083) = 0, moreover 3*323525083^2 cannot be written as x^2 + 10*y^2 + 2^z with x,y,z nonnegative integers. We note also that a(270035155) = 0 but 3*270035155^2 - 2^0 has the form x^2 + 10*y^2 with x and y integers.
%C A301805 My way to check whether 3*n^2 can be written as x^2 + 10*y^2 + 2^z is to find z such that 3*n^2 - 2^z can be written as x^2 + 10*y^2. I observe that a positive integer n has the form x^2 + 10*y^2 with x and y integers if and only if the p-adic order ord_p(n) of n is even for any prime p == 3, 17, 21, 27, 29, 31, 33, 39 (mod 40) and the sum of those ord_p(n) with p prime and p == 2, 5, 7, 13, 23, 37 (mod 40) is even.
%C A301805 From _David A. Corneth_, Mar 27 2018: (Start)
%C A301805 If a(n) > 0 then a(2*n) > 0; 3*n^2 = x^2 + 10*y^2 + 2^z <=> 3*(2*n)^2 = 4 * 3*n^2 = 4 * (x^2 + 10*y^2 + 2^z) = (2*x)^2 + 10 * (2*y)^2 + 2^(z + 2).
%C A301805 So we just need to check odd n and as z > 0, 2 | 2^z and furthermore 2 | 10 * y^2 so 3*x^2 must be odd, i.e., x must be odd for 3*n^2 to be odd. Also, y must be odd. For odd n, 3*n^2 == 3 (mod 4), for odd x, x^2 == (1 mod 4), for z >= 3, 2^z == 0 (mod 4) so 10 * y^2 must be == 2 (mod 4) which happens if and only if y is odd. (End)
