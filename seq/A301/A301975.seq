%N A301975 Numbers whose abundance is divisible by its number of divisors.
%C A301975 Numbers n such that f(n) = A033880(n)/A000005(n) is an integer.
%C A301975 Perfect numbers (A000396) and odd primes (A065091) are members, unified (along with 1) into a subsequence on which abs(f(n)) reaches record extrema. For perfect numbers, these are global minima, for the other terms, maxima.
%C A301975 Another notable subsequence is defined by f(n)=1: numbers whose abundance equals their number of divisors. They all belong to A056075. The first 3 terms are 56, 7192, 7232. There are 11 of them up to 10^9.
