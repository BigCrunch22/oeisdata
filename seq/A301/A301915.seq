%N A301915 a(n) is the multiplicative order of 3, modulo A301913(n).
%C A301915 The multiplicative order of x mod y is the least positive value of z for which x^z == 1 (mod y).
%C A301915 Note: This is the least value for which A301913(n) divides 3^(A301914(n) + k*A(n)) + 2 for every nonnegative integer k.
%e A301915 a(1) = 4 because A301913(1) = 5 and the multiplicative order of 3 modulo 5 = 4.
%e A301915 Note: Given a(1) = 4 and A301914(1) = 5, every value of k that can be written as k = 5 + 5j (for a nonnegative integer j) is a multiple of A301913(1) = 5.
%e A301915 a(7) = 30 because A301913(7) = 31 and the multiplicative order of 3 modulo 31 = 4.
%e A301915 Note: Given a(7) = 9 and A301914(7) = 30, every value of k that can be written as k = 30 + 9j (for a nonnegative integer j) is a multiple of A301913(7) = 31.
