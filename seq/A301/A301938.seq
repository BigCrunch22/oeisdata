%N A301938 Numbers n with the property that n^2 contains a sequence of four or more consecutive 8's.
%C A301938 The sequence would certainly be infinite and runs of more than four 8's occur relatively frequently. For example, between 1 and 26000, there are two numbers whose squares contain five sequential 8's. These are 12202^2 = 148888804 and 20221^2 = 408888841.
%C A301938 If n is in the sequence, then so are k*10^d+n for all k >= 1, where n^2 has d digits. Therefore the sequence has nonzero lower asymptotic density. Presumably the asymptotic density is 1. - _Robert Israel_, Mar 29 2018
