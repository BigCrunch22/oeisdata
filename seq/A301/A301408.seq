%N A301408 Repeatedly map numbers to the number of letters in the English name (include spaces, but no hyphens and no "and"s); sequence gives smallest nonnegative integer that needs exactly n iterations to get to 4.

%e A301408 Since "twenty three" has 12 letters (including the space), "twelve" has 6 letters, "three" has 5 letters, "four" has four letters, and no other smaller nonnegative integer maps to 4 in exactly 5 iterations, then a(5) = 23.
%Y A301408 Cf. A227290, A005589, A016037 (these do not count the spaces in the names of larger integers).
