%N A301372 Conjectured best solution for the problem stated in A098072.
%C A301372 In A098072 an example of a 3 X 3 matrix was shown that produces the maximum number A088021(3)=10080 of distinct determinants when all permutations of the given matrix entries are performed under the condition of minimizing the greatest entry of the matrix. The current sequence improves this result, i.e., the maximum is reduced from 100 to 99. It is optimal under the assumptions that the matrix entries are distinct and that the two smallest entries are 0 and 1.
%C A301372 The resulting determinant values are given in A301757.
%Y A301372 Cf. A088021, A098072, A301757.
