%N A301755 Decimal expansion of 3/8.
%C A301755 This is the value of Zc which is the critical compression factor for Van der Waals gases.
%C A301755 The compression factor of a gas is defined as Z = p Vm/RT, where p is the pressure, Vm is the molar volume, T the temperature and R the gas constant.
%C A301755 The critical forms for Van der Waals gasses of pressure, temperature and volume are respectively: pc = a/(27b^2), Tc = 8a/(27R*b), Vc = 3b.
%C A301755 By plugging in the critical forms of the variables you will get Zc = pc Vc/RTc = 3/8.
%C A301755 Probability of intersection of 2 random chords in a circle, when their midpoints are selected randomly in the circle. See Solomon. - _Michel Marcus_, Mar 29 2018
%C A301755 The distance of the centroid of a unit-radius solid hemisphere from its base (the 3D analog of A232715). - _Amiram Eldar_, Jul 19 2022
