%N A114545 A self-descriptive fractal sequence. Each element gives the length and first element of a finite arithmetic sequence. Replace each finite sequence with its length (or first term) and you recover the original infinite sequence.
%e A114545 The first element is 3, which describes the sequence 3, 4, 5. The second element, 4, describes the run 4, 5, 6, 7.
