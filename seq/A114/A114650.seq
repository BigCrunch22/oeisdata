%N A114650 a(1)=1. For n>1, a(n) is smallest positive integer not among the earlier terms of the sequence such that floor(log(a(n))) does not equal floor(log(a(n-1))).
%C A114650 Sequence is a permutation of the positive integers. (Sequence A114651 is the inverse permutation.)
%C A114650 Apparently this permutation is completely decomposable into (disjoint) cycles of finite length. The number of fixed points (cf. A114726) seems to be infinite, but for each k>1 there are presumably only finitely many cycles of length k (cf. A114727 and A114728). - _Klaus Brockhaus_, Dec 29 2005
%e A114650 Since all positive integers m where floor(log(m)) equals 0 or 1 occur among the first 11 terms of the sequence and since floor(log(a(11))) = 2, then a(12) must be 21 (which is the smallest positive integer m such that floor(log(m)) = 3).
