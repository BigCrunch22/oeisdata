%N A114061 Numbers n such that n = (product of digits of n) * (sum of digits of n) in some base.
%C A114061 This sequence is infinite since b^2+b is in the sequence for all b>1: in base b, b^2+b has digits {1,b} and (1*b)*(1+b)=b^2+b.
%e A114061 12 is in the sequence since in base 9, 12 has digits {1,3} and (1*3)*(1+3)=12.
%Y A114061 Cf. A038369.
