%N A114381 Sums of p-th to the q-th prime where p and q are consecutive primes.
%C A114381 The number of terms in this sequence is infinite since there is no largest prime number. Conjecture: There will always be an n and i such that a(n) >= a(n+i) or the sequence will alternate forever. Equality does take place in the small sample shown with the entry 991. Certainly the proof of an infinity many twin primes would be a strong probable proof of this assertion. My guess is the alternation would always occur when a twin prime is encountered and often for other consecutive primes such as those differing by 4.
%C A114381 Some numbers occur (at least) twice: 991 at positions 11 and 14, 104435 at positions 193 and 348, 712363 at positions 654 and 2364. - _Klaus Brockhaus_, Jul 01 2009
