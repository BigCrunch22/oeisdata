%N A114309 Lexicographically earliest sequence which has the property that it lists the position of the even digits in the concatenation of its terms.
%C A114309 A self-describing sequence. See the sequence as a succession of digits: then a(n) is the position of the even digits of the sequence.
%C A114309 "Lexicographically earliest" refers to comparing sequences term by term, not the strings obtained by the concatenation. (This is not possible, since then the first term could be an arbitrarily long string of 1's.) In other words, term after term, the smallest possible value not leading to a contradiction is appended.
%e A114309 We can't have a(1)=1 (since then the first digit would not be even) nor a(1)=2 (since then the first digit would be even), but a(1)=3 is possible.
%e A114309 This implies that there follows another odd digit, a(2)=5, before the first even digit a(a(1))=a(3)=6.
%e A114309 Then comes another odd digit, a(4)=7, since the second even digit occurs only in position a(2)=5, namely a(5)=8.
