%N A114149 Self-describing sequence: 1 even integer between two odd, then 2 even integers between two odd, then 3 even integers, then 4, then 6... The length of each run of even integers is given by the sequence itself (the smallest odd available integer is used when needed).
%e A114149 Runs of even integers are between brackets:
%e A114149 1,(2),3,(4,6),7,(8,10,12),13,(14,16,18,20),21,(22,24,26,28,30,32),33...
%e A114149 1 even 2 even 3 even 4 even 6 even... etc. = the sequence itself
