%N A114378 Area of annuli of consecutive integer thickness.
%C A114378 The annulus is the region between two concentric circles of radius r(i) and r(i+1). The area of the annulus is the area of the bigger circle minus the area of the smaller one or Pi(r(i+1)^2 - r(i)^2). Then for this sequence which defines the thickness or the annuli as the consecutive integers, we determine the area using the formula above and the summation formula for an arithmetic progression. Area of annulus(i+1) = Pi(r(i+1)*(r(i+1)+1)/2 - r(i)*(r(i)+1)/2). In other words, the annuli form concentric circles whose successive radii are the sum of the successive annuli up to that point.

%e A114378 Any circle is an annulus formed by a circle of radius r and a circle of radius 0. So the integer area of the annulus of the unit circle is Pi(1^2 - 0^2) = 3, the first term in the sequence.
