%N A114022 Self-describing sequence: a(n) gives the number of integers in the sequence which are < a(n)^2.
%C A114022 Earliest strictly increasing sequence satisfying a(a(n))=a(n)^2. - _Benoit Cloitre_, May 26 2021
%e A114022 There are 0 integer in the sequence which are < 0^2; there is only 1 integer < 1^2 (this is "0", which is < 1); there are 3 integers < 3^2 (they are 0,1,3 which are < 9); there are 9 integers < 81 (0,1,3,9,10,11,12,13,14); etc.
