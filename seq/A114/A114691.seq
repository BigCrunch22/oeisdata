%N A114691 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of hill-free Schroeder paths of length 2n that have k weak ascents (1<=k<=n-1 for n>=2; k=1 for n=1). A Schroeder path of length 2n is a lattice path from (0,0) to (2n,0) consisting of U=(1,1), D=(1,-1) and H=(2,0) steps and never going below the x-axis. A hill is a peak at height 1. A weak ascent in a Schroeder path is a maximal sequence of consecutive U and H steps.
%C A114691 Row n contains n-1 terms (n>=2). Row sums are the little Schroeder numbers (A001003).
%F A114691 G.f.=G=z(t+H)/(1-z-zH), where H is given by H =z(2+H)(t+H).
%e A114691 T(3,2)=4 because we have (UH)D(H),(UU)DD(H),(UU)D(H)D and (UU)D(U)DD, where U=(1,1), D=(1,-1) and H=(2,0) (the weak ascents are shown between parentheses).
