%N A114148 Self-describing sequence: 2 odd integers between two even, then 3 odd integers between two even, then 5 odd integers, then 6, then 7... The length of each run of odd integers is given by the sequence itself (the smallest even available integer is used when needed).
%e A114148 Runs of odd integers are between brackets:
%e A114148 2,(3,5),6,(7,9,11),12,(13,15,17,19,21),22,(23,25,27,29,31,33),34...
%e A114148 2 odd 3 odd 5 odd 6 odd ... etc. = the sequence itself
