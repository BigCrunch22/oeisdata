%N A114861 a(n) is smallest positive integer not among the earlier terms of the sequence, not equal to n and which is coprime to its adjacent terms in the sequence.
%C A114861 Sequence is a permutation of the positive integers. (Inverse permutation is sequence A114862.)
%e A114861 a(8) = 11 since 11 is the smallest positive integer not among the first 7 terms of the sequence, not equal to 8 and which is coprime to a(7) = 6.
