%N A114491 Number of "ultrasweet" Boolean functions of n variables.
%C A114491 A Boolean function is ultrasweet if it is sweet (see A114302) under all permutations of the variables.
%C A114491 Two students, Shaddin Dughmi and Ian Post, have identified these functions as precisely the monotone Boolean functions whose prime implicants are the bases of a matroid, together with the constant function 0. This explains why a(n) = A058673(n) + 1.
%e A114491 For all n>1, a function like "x2" is counted in the present sequence but not in A114572.
%Y A114491 Cf. A114302, A114303, A114572, A058673.
%K A114491 nonn
