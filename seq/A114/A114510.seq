%N A114510 a(1) = 0. s(0) = {0}. s(n) = s(n-1) U s(a(n)) U {n}, where U represents a concatenation of finite sequences. The sequence {a(n)} is the limit of s(m) as m -> infinity.
%C A114510 Number of terms in s(n) is A114512(n).
%e A114510 s(1) = {0,0,1}, s(2) = {0,0,1,0,2}. s(3) = s(2) U s(a(3)) U {3} = {0,0,1,0,2} U {0,0,1} U {3} = {0,0,1,0,2,0,0,1,3}, which are the first 9 terms of this sequence.
