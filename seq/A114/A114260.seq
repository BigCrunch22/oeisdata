%N A114260 Numbers k such that the 4th power of k contains exactly 4 copies of each digit of k.
%C A114260 First 13 terms of the sequence are also pandigital, i.e., they contain all the 10 digits at least once. This is probably accidental, but quite curious.
%C A114260 If a(n) is in the sequence, then 10*a(n) is also in the sequence. So 10^k*a(n) is also in the sequence for positive integers k.  Thus this sequence differs from A365144. - _Ray Chandler_, Aug 23 2023
%C A114260 From _David A. Corneth_, Aug 30 2023: (START)
%C A114260 Not all terms are pandigital, for example 65190218436, 75932056341 and 83581076421 are not.
%C A114260 For any k ends in, say, 425742 (which has six digits) the last six digits of k^4 are fixed. So if k ends in 425742 then k^4 ends in 425742^2 mod 10^6 = 318096 and so it must have a 3, 1, 8, 0, 9 and 6 none of which are contained in 425742.
%C A114260 Therefore if k ends in 425742 then it must have at least 12 digits. In a search for terms <= 10^11 this eases the search, in a search for terms <= 10^12 this leaves only 6! * 5 / 6 = 600 cases to check instead of 10^6.
%C A114260 An additional idea one might use is that the number of digits of k^4 must be a multiple of 4. I.e. 10^(4*m + 3) <= k^4 <= 10^(4*m + 4) so 10^m * 10^0.75 < m < 10^(m + 1) (all strict inequalities as 10^0.75 (cf. A210522) is irrational) which tells us a bunch about the leading digits of k.
%C A114260 Checking pandigital numbers seperately might ease the search. That way if the union of some k and last q digits of k^4 is all decimal digits one could end the search there. This goes for example for 100426. If a term ends in 100426 then it has all decimal digits. (END)
