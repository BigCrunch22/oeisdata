%N A114260 Numbers k such that the 4th power of k contains exactly 4 copies of each digit of k.
%C A114260 First 13 terms of the sequence are also pandigital, i.e., they contain all the 10 digits at least once. This is probably accidental, but quite curious.
%C A114260 If a(n) is in the sequence, then 10*a(n) is also in the sequence. So 10^k*a(n) is also in the sequence for positive integers k.  Thus this sequence differs from A365144. - _Ray Chandler_, Aug 23 2023
