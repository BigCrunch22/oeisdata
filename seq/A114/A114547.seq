%N A114547 A self-descriptive fractal sequence. Each element gives the first term and length of a finite arithmetic sequence. Replace each finite sequence with its length (or first term) and you recover the original infinite sequence.
%e A114547 The first element, 5, describes the five-term sequence 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The second element, 6, describes the six-term sequence 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
