%N A114990 a(n) = a(n-2) + A000265(a(n-1)), a(0)=0, a(1)=1.
%C A114990 The sequence is clearly not monotonic, but the subsequences with even resp. odd indices are both strictly increasing. The sequence is obviously bounded above by the Fibonacci sequence A000045. The subsequence of n-th terms, where n is congruent to 2 or 3 mod 4, is bounded below by the Fibonacci sequence; therefore a(2n)>f(n) for n>1. - Joseph Pedersen (jmp456(AT)psu.edu), Feb 27 2006, rephrased by _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 18 2013
%e A114990 The highest odd integer dividing a(11)=28 is 7. So a(12) = a(10) + 7 = 17 + 7 = 24.
%e A114990 The greatest odd divisor of a(11)=28 is 7, so a(12)= a(10)+7 = 17+7 = 24.
