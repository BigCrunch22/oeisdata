%N A114544 A self-descriptive fractal sequence. Each element describes the length and beginning of a finite arithmetic sequence. Replace each finite sequence with its length (or its first element) and you recover the original infinite sequence.
%e A114544 The first element is 2, describing the two-term arithmetic sequence 2, 3. The second and third elements, 3, describe 3, 4, 5.
