%N A114889 a(1)=1 and, for n>1, a(n) is the smallest integer greater than a(n-1) such that a(n)+a(i) is not a power of 3, for i=1,..., n-1.
%C A114889 The differences of {a(n)}, together with a conjectured formula for them, is given in A114890.
%e A114889 Given that a(1)=1, a(2)=3 and a(3)=4, we find that a(4)>5 since 5+4=9 and a(4)>6 since 6+3=9. But none of 7+1, 7+3, or 7+4 is a power of 3, so a(4)=7.
