%N A114007 Distinct primes in increasing order interleaved with primes of the form concatenation two or more previous terms say all a(i), a(j) i<j, then all a(i), a(j), a(k) i < j < k etc. Once all the concatenations have exhausted then the least prime that has not occurred earlier.
%C A114007 A rearrangement of the primes.
%e A114007 23 follows 3. Then the next term is 5 then no concatenation primes occur hence is followed by 7, etc. Each prime occurs only once.
%K A114007 base,more,nonn
%O A114007 0,1
