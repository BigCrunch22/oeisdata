%N A114021 Number of semiprimes between n and n + sqrt(n).
%C A114021 It appears that for n > 37 it is always true that a(n) > 0. The exponent can be reduced further. Since 597 + 597^(0.4129) > 611, leaping the record semiprime gap between 597 and 611, it seems that for n > 597 it is always true that there is a semiprime between n and n^(0.4129). It seems that for n > 2705 it is always true that there is a semiprime between n and n^(0.3509). These conjectures are related to the various sequences about semiprime gaps and the merit of such gaps.
%C A114021 a(96) appears to be the last zero term. - _T. D. Noe_, Aug 12 2008
