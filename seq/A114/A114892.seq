%N A114892 a(n) is the cycle length corresponding to A114891(n).
%C A114892 Besides 3 for the cycle (5,7,6) the following lengths of cycles with elements <= 1500000 occur: 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 16, 18. The even period lengths appear in a rather regular manner, presumably infinitely often.
%e A114892 A114727(12) = 32 belongs to the 6-cycle (32,37,36,35,34,33), so a(12) = 6.
%Y A114892 Cf. A114861, A114891.
