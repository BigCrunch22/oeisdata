%N A340300 a(n) is the number of iterations for n to reach 1 under the following scheme. If k == 0 (mod 3), then k -> k/3, if k == 1 (mod 3) k -> 2k, and if k == 2 (mod 3) add the middle two divisors of k and divide the result by 3.
%e A340300 a(1) = 0 since 1 is already at 1 which requires no iteration of the scheme;
%e A340300 a(2) = 1 since (1 + 2)/3 -> 1;
%e A340300 a(3) = 1 since 3/3 -> 1;
%e A340300 a(4) = 3 since 4 -> 8 -> (2+4)/3 -> 2 -> 1;
%e A340300 a(5) = 2 since 5 -> (1+5)/2 -> 2 -> 1;
%e A340300 a(6) = 2 since 6 -> 2 -> 1.
