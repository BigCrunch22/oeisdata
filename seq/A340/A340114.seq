%N A340114 Table T(n,k), n>=1, k>=1, row n being the lexicographically earliest of the longest sequences of distinct positive integers in which the k-th term does not exceed n*k and the smaller of adjacent terms divides the larger, giving a prime.
%C A340114 The longest sequence is finite for all n. We can deduce this, because we know from the work of Saias that A337125(m)/m * log m is bounded, where A337125(m) is the length of the longest simple path in the divisor graph of {1,...,m}. See the comment in A337125 giving constraints on its terms.
%C A340114 The sequence of row lengths starts 2, 6, 25, 97.

%F A340114 For n >= 1, 1 <= k <= row length(n), T(n,k) <= n * k.
%F A340114 For n >= 1, 1 <= k < row length(n), max(T(n,k+1)/T(n,k), T(n,k)/T(n,k+1)) is in A000040.
%e A340114 For n = 1, the only sequences of distinct positive integers that have their k-th term not exceeding 1*k = k, are those whose n-th term is k. The longest such sequence in which the smaller of adjacent terms divides the larger, giving a prime, is (1, 2), since 3/2 is 1.5. So row 1 has length 2, with T(1,1) = 1, T(1,2) = 2.
