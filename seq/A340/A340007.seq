%N A340007 Number of times the n-th prime (=A000040(n)) occurs in A038711.
%C A340007 Each term in A038711 is either 1 or a prime number. Moreover it is known that each prime occurs only a finite number of times in A038711.
%C A340007 By excluding the terms that equal one from A038711, we observe the smallest value of A038711(n)/log(A002110(n)) in the range n = 2..1000 to be ~1.017. From this it is believed that the primes less than 0.9*log(A002110(1001))*1.017 (~ 7157) will not occur anymore in the sequence A038711 for n > 1000; the applied factor 0.9 is a safety factor to be more or less sure that the prime numbers up to about 7157 will no longer occur in A038711.

%F A340007 It seems that Sum_{k = 1..n} a(k) ~ 0.7*A000040(n)/log(log(A000040(n))).
%e A340007 The prime number 17 occurs 1 time in A038711, and A000040(7) = 17, so a(7) = 1.
%e A340007 The prime number 5 does not occur in A038711, and A000040(3) = 5, so a(3) = 0.
