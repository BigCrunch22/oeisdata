%N A340347 An aware-like sequence; empty the first pit/integer and sow its content to the right, one seed/unit per pit/integer. When this is done the new sequence and the starting one share the same succession of digits.
%C A340347 This sequence is the lexicographically earliest one of distinct integers > 0 and is conjectured to be a permutation of the integers > 0.

%e A340347 We start with a(1) = 1 and add 1 to a(2) to form b(1), the first term of the new sequence, thus b(1) = 109 + 1 = 110;
%e A340347 we go on from there with a(3) = 2 to form b(2) = 8 + 1 = 9 and b(3) = 27 + 1 = 28;
%e A340347 we go on from there with a(6) = 3 to form b(4) = 26 + 1 = 27 , b(5) = 31 + 1 = 32 and b(6) = 5 + 1 = 6;
%e A340347 we go on from there with a(10) = 4 to form b(7) = 30 + 1 = 31, b(8) = 53 + 1 = 54, b(9) = 29 + 1 = 30 and b(10) = 52 + 1 = 53; etc.
%e A340347 If we now compare the successive terms a(n) and b(n), we see that they share the same digit succession:
%e A340347 a(n) = 1, 109, 2, 8, 27, 3, 26, 31, 5, 4, 30, 53, 29, 52, ...
%e A340347 b(n) = 110, 9, 28, 27, 32, 6, 31, 54, 30, 53, ...
