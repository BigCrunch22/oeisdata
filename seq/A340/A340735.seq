%N A340735 a(n) is the smallest positive integer that begins a run of exactly 2*n-1 consecutive integers having at least 4 divisors each.
%C A340735 If "integers having at least 4 divisors each" in this sequence's definition were replaced with "integers having at least 3 divisors each" (i.e., composite numbers), the resulting sequence would be A045881.
%C A340735 A045881(n) = a(n) except when the run of 2*n-1 consecutive composite numbers beginning with A045881(n) includes a number with exactly 3 divisors (i.e., the square of a prime). The first six such exceptions are as follows:

%C A340735 There are no other exceptions among the first 672 terms of A045881 (see the b-file there). Can it be proved that there are no other exceptions?
%e A340735 a(1)=6 because 6=2*3 (which has 4 divisors, {1,2,3,6}) is the first isolated number that has at least 4 divisors.
%e A340735 a(2)=14 because 14 is the first number that begins a run of exactly 2*2-1=3 consecutive integers having at least 4 divisors each: tau(14)=tau(2*7)=4; tau(15)=tau(3*5)=4; tau(16)=tau(2^4)=5.
%e A340735 a(3)=32 because 32 is the first number that begins a run of exactly 2*3-1=5 consecutive integers having at least 4 divisors each: tau(32)=tau(2^5)=6; tau(33)=tau(3*11)=4; tau(34)=tau(2*17)=4; tau(35)=tau(5*7)=4; tau(36)=tau(2^2*3^2)=9.
