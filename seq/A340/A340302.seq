%N A340302 Numbers k such that k and the least number that is larger than k and has the same prime signature as k also has the same set of distinct prime divisors as k.
%C A340302 Numbers k such that A007947(k) = A007947(A081761(k)).
%C A340302 This sequence is infinite since it includes all the numbers of the form 2*6^k for k>=1.

%e A340302 12 = 2^2 * 3 is a term since the least number that is larger than 12 and has the same prime signature as 12 is 18 = 2 * 3^2 which also has the same set of distinct prime divisors as 12, {2, 3}.
