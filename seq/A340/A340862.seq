%N A340862 Number of times the number n turns up in pseudo-Fibonacci sequences starting with [k, 1] (with k >= 1), excluding the starting terms.
%C A340862 In the first 100000 terms, this never exceeds 8. For any n > 2, a(n) will be at least 2, since k=n-1 and k=n-2 will both work.
%C A340862 Conjecture: for n > 2, a(n) appears to be equal to 1 + A067148(n).

%e A340862 For n=2, the single solution is the third term of the Fibonacci sequence (k=1), so a(2)=1.
%e A340862 For n=3, we observe the value as the fourth term for k=1, and the third term for k=2 for a total count of a(3) = 2.
%e A340862 For n=4, we have k=2 and k=3, so a(4) = 2.
%e A340862 For n=5, we have k=1, k=3, k=4.
