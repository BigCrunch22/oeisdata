%N A340730 a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) = a(n-1) - min(a(n-1),n) if nonnegative and not already in the sequence, otherwise a(n) = a(n-1) + min(a(n-1),n).
%C A340730 This sequence uses the same rules as RecamÃ¡n's sequence A005132 except that the step size for each term n is set to the minimum of n and a(n-1).
%C A340730 The terms are slightly concentrated along the linear relationships a(n) = k*n, where k is an integer >= 1. Other values are distributed between these lines. See the linked image.
%C A340730 The smallest value not to have appeared after 5 million terms is 8697. It is unknown if all terms eventually appear.

%e A340730 a(3) = 4 as min(3,a(2)) = min(3,2) = 2, and as 0 has already appeared a(3) = a(2) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4.
%e A340730 a(5) = 3 as min(5,a(4)) = min(5,8) = 5, and as 3 has not already appeared a(5) = a(4) - 5 = 8 - 5 = 3.
