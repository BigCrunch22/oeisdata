%N A340531 Irregular triangle read by rows T(n,k), (n >= 1, k >= 1), in which row n has length is A000070(n-1) and every column k is A024916, the sum of all divisors of all numbers <= n.
%C A340531 Consider a symmetric tower (a polycube) in which the terraces are the symmetric representation of sigma (n..1) respectively starting from the base (cf. A237270, A237593).
%C A340531 The levels of the terraces starting from the base are the first n terms of A000070, that is A000070(0)..A000070(n-1), hence the differences between two successive levels give the partition numbers A000041, that is A000041(0)..A000041(n-1).
%C A340531 T(n,k) is the volume (the number of cells) in the k-th level starting from the base.
%C A340531 This polycube has the property that the volume (the total number of cells) equals A182738(n), the sum of all parts of all partitions of all positive integers <= n.
%C A340531 A dissection of the symmetric tower is a three-dimensional spiral whose top view is described in A239660.
%C A340531 Other triangles related to the volume of this polycube are A340527 and A340579.
%C A340531 The symmetric tower is a member of the family of the stepped pyramid described in A245092.
%C A340531 For another symmetric tower of the same family and whose volume equals A066186(n) see A340423.
%C A340531 The sum of row n of triangle equals A182738(n). That property is due to the correspondence between divisors and parts. For more information see A336811.
