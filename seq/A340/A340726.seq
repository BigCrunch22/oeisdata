%N A340726 Maximum power V_s*A_s consumed by an electrical network with n unit resistors and input voltage V_s and current A_s constrained to be exact integers which are coprime, and such that all currents between nodes are integers.
%C A340726 This sequence is an analog of A338861. Equality a(n) = A338861(n) holds for small n only, see example.
%C A340726 Let V_s denote the specific voltage, i.e., the lowest integer voltage, which induces integer currents everywhere in the network. Denote by A_s the specific current, i.e., the corresponding total current.
%C A340726 A planar network with n unit resistors corresponds to a squared rectangle with height V_s and width A_s. The electrical power V_s*A_s therefore equals the area of that rectangle. In the historical overview (Stuart Anderson link) A_s is called complexity.
%C A340726 The corresponding rectangle tiling provides the optimal power rating of the 1 ohm resistors with respect to the specific voltage V_s and current A_s. See the picture From_Quilt_to_Net in the link section, which also provides insight in the "mysterious" correspondence between rectangle tilings and electric networks. For non-planar nets the idea of rectangle tilings can be widened to 'Cartesian squarings'. A Cartesian squaring is the dissection of the product P X Q of two finite sets into 'squaresets', i.e., sets A X B with A subset of P and B subset of Q, and card(A) = card(B). - _Rainer Rosenthal_, Dec 14 2022
%C A340726 Take the set SetA337517(n) of resistances, counted by A337517. For each resistance R multiply numerator and denominator. Conjecture: a(n) is the maximum of all these products. The reason is that common factors of V_s and A_s are quite rare (see the beautiful exceptional example with 21 resistors).
