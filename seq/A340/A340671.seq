%N A340671 a(n) is the number of values m such that, if the first n positive integers are arranged in alphabetical order in US English, the m-th term in the order is equal to m.
%C A340671 Nonnegative integers can be used instead of positive integers, since zero will always be the last element alphabetically and will not change the sequence of the other integers.
%C A340671 This sequence uses standard US English names for numbers. "and" is not used, e.g., 101 is rendered as "one hundred one" rather than "one hundred and one".
%C A340671 a(n) is equivalent to the number of terms in the n-th row of A124172 for which the term in the k-th column is equal to k.
%C A340671 For n < 100, a(n) + 2 = a(200 + n). This is because a(200) = 2, and the numbers starting with "two hundred" will follow all of 1-199 alphabetically, so the range [201, 200 + n] will be in the same order as [1, n]. Similarly, because a(2000) = 4, for n < 999, a(n) + 4 = a(2000 + n).
%e A340671 a(1) = 1 ({one}, the 1st term is 1);
%e A340671 a(2) = 2 ({one, two}, the 1st term is 1 and the 2nd term is 2);
%e A340671 a(3) = 1 ({one, three, two}, the 1st term is 1);
%e A340671 a(4) = 1 ({four, one, three, two}, the 3rd term is 3);
%e A340671 a(11) = a(12) = 2 (the 4th term is 4 and the 7th term is 7);
%e A340671 a(13) = 3 (the 4th term is 4, the 7th term is 7, and the 12th term is 12).
