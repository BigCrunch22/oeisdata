%N A340708 Maximum denominator of resistances obtained by an electrical network with n unit resistors.
%C A340708 a(n) is taken from the set of resistance values counted by A337517(n). These sets can be computed by the PARI program of Andrew Howroyd in A180414.
%C A340708 Also the maximum numerator of these electrical networks for small n.
%C A340708 Maximum numerator and maximum denominator coincide for planar networks: for every resistance R in a planar network with n resistors there is always another planar network with n resistors and resistance 1/R. For nonplanar networks this is not necessarily so, as can be seen in A338573.
%C A340708 The asymmetry is illustrated by the example a(15) = 2153.
%C A340708 The author conjectures that this asymmetry will increase with n, and eventually the maxima will differ.
%C A340708 Conjecture: a(19) = 22233, a(20) = 39918. It would be very desirable to know at which value of n > 18 the maximum values of numerators and denominators differ for the first time. - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Apr 19 2021
