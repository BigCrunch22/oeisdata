%N A340449 Nonsquare composites n whose smallest prime factor is greater than or equal to n^(2/5).
%C A340449 Referred to as "freak-show composites" by Doug Massey (see link), who noted that they are exceptionally difficult to factor by hand using trial division.
%C A340449 4181, 4183, 4187, and 4189 are the first four consecutive terms that differ only in the last decimal digit.  The next such set of four consecutive terms begins at 806621.
%C A340449 Ankit Bisain says that for sufficiently large x, there are fewer values in this sequence less than x than there are primes less than x.
