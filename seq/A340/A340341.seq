%N A340341 Number of polymings with n cells, distinguishing mirror images.
%C A340341 A polyming is a generalized polyiamond whose cells may be joined at corners as well as at edges.  I introduced the term in 2010.  In A319324 and elsewhere, David Bevan calls these shapes "polyglasses." In A239658, Abe Wits and Ragnar Groot Koerkamp call them simply "triangular polyplets."

%e A340341 a(3)=16, because there are 11 two-sided 3-mings (identifying mirror images), and 5 of them are chiral.  See the link above.
%Y A340341 Cf. A239658, A319324.
