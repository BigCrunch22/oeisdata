%N A340593 a(0) = 0; for n > 0, if n appears in the sequence then a(n) = a(n-1) - lastindex(n)  if nonnegative and not already in the sequence, otherwise a(n) = a(n-1) + lastindex(n), where lastindex(n) is the index of the last appearance of n. Otherwise a(n) = a(n-1) - n if nonnegative and not already in the sequence, otherwise a(n) = a(n-1) + n.
%C A340593 This sequences uses the same rules as RecamÃ¡n's sequence A005132 if the value of n itself has not previously appeared in the sequence. However if n has previously appeared then the step size from a(n-1) is set to lastindex(n), where lastindex(n) is the sequence index of the last appearance of n.
%C A340593 The smallest value not to have appeared after 1 million terms is 52. It is unknown if all terms eventually appear.
%e A340593 a(3) = 5 as a(2) = 3 = n, thus the step size from a(2) is 2. As 1 has previously appeared a(3) = a(2) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5.
%e A340593 a(5) = 6 as a(3) = 5 = n, thus the step size from a(4) is 3. As 6 has not previously appeared a(5) = a(4) - 3 = 9 - 3 = 6.
