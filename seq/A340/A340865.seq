%N A340865 Primes p such that (p^2 + 1)/2 and 2*p^2 - 1 are also prime.
%C A340865 Intersection of A048161 and A106483.
%C A340865 How many triangular numbers with 6 divisors (A292989) can be divisible by the same squared prime p^2?
%C A340865 The k-th triangular number T(k) = A000217(k) = k*(k+1)/2 can be written as the product of two coprime factors A and B where A=k and B=(k+1)/2 for odd k, A=k/2 and B=k+1 for even k. If a triangular number has 6 divisors, then it is of the form p^2*q where p and q are distinct primes. We can identify four cases:
%C A340865 Case 1: A = k = p^2 and B = (k+1)/2 = q, so q = (p^2 + 1)/2; solutions occur at primes p in A048161.
%C A340865 Case 2: A = k = q and B = (k+1)/2 = p^2, so 2*p^2 - 1 = q; solutions occur at primes p in A106483.
%C A340865 Case 3: A = k/2 = p^2 and B = k+1 = q. In this case, 2*p^2 + 1 = q. For p = 2, we would get q = 9 (nonprime), so p must be odd. If prime p > 3 (so q > 19), we have p^2 == 1 (mod 3), so q == 0 (mod 3), hence nonprime. So the only solution for this case occurs at p=3, q=19, t = 3^2*19 = 171.
%C A340865 Case 4: A = k/2 = q and B = k+1 = p^2. In this case, 2*q + 1 = p^2, so p is odd, but then p^2 == 1 (mod 8), so q == 0 (mod 4), hence q is not prime: no solutions exist.
%C A340865 Since Case 4 has no solutions, at most three triangular numbers with 6 divisors can be divisible by the same squared prime p^2; Case 3 has a solution only at p=3 and, in fact, there are three triangular numbers with 6 divisors that are divisible by 3^2: t = 3^2*5 = 45 = T(9), t = 3^2*17 = 153 = T(17), and 3^2*19 = 171 = T(18).
%C A340865 For all primes p > 3, then, at most two triangular numbers with 6 divisors are divisible by p^2; this sequence (after the initial term, 3) lists the primes p such that p^2 divides exactly two triangular numbers that have 6 divisors.

%e A340865 Both (3^2 + 1)/2 = 5 and 2*3^2 - 1 = 17 are prime, so 3 is in the sequence.
%e A340865 (5^2 + 1)/2 = 13 is prime, but 2*5^2 - 1 = 49 = 7^2 is not prime, so 5 is not in the sequence.
%e A340865 (7^2 + 1)/2 = 25 is not prime, so even though 2*7^2 - 1 = 97 is prime, 7 is not in the sequence.
%e A340865 Neither (23^2 + 1)/2 = 265 = 5*53 nor 2*23^2 - 1 = 1057 = 7*151 is prime, so 23 is not in the sequence.
