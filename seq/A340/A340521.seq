%N A340521 List of possible orders of automorphism groups of finite groups.
%C A340521 The terms shown here match the initial terms of all of A002174, A002202, A049225, but this is a strictly different sequence since it is known that it contains 3^7 = 2187 (which is the smallest odd term greater than 1), whereas for the other three sequences all terms greater than 1 are even.
%C A340521 This is a supersequence of A002202 since |Aut(Z/nZ)| = phi(n). - _Jianing Song_, Feb 05 2021
%C A340521 John Bray has produced a group G of order 3^2*19 = 171 such that |Aut G| = 1026 = 2.3^3.19. So 1026 is in the present sequence but is not in A002202. So the present sequence contains both odd and even terms not in A002202. - _Des MacHale_, Feb 10 2021
