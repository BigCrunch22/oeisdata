%N A340015 a(n) is the least even number not used earlier and equal to the sum of the odd digits of the terms up to and including a(n), if such a number exists; otherwise, a(n) is the least odd number not occurring earlier.
%C A340015 From _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 06 2022: (Start)
%C A340015 From the definition it is immediate that any even term is equal to the sum of all odd digits in the sequence up to that term.
%C A340015 Also, the subsequences of terms of given parity are both strictly increasing: The odd terms give exactly the sequence of all odd numbers, A005408, and any even number not occurring before a given even a(n) (e.g., 2, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16, ...) will never occur in the sequence.
%C A340015 The search space to check whether an even number can extend the sequence is bounded because using a number with more digits can increase the sum of digits by at most 9 per digit, while the number itself becomes (roughly) 10 times larger with each additional digit.
%C A340015 We have the following properties:
%C A340015 1) If the sum of all odd digits up to a(n) has only even digits, then a(n+1) equals that sum.
%C A340015 2) An even term a(n) can never be immediately followed by a term a(n+1) with only even digits.
%C A340015 3) An even term a(n) can be followed by another even term a(n+1) if the sum of the odd digits of a(n+1) is equal to a(n+1) - a(n), as for example at (..., 114, 116, 118, ...) and (..., 130, 134, 138, ...).
%C A340015 4) If a(n) is even and s = (sum of the odd digits of a(n)) can be added to a(n) without changing any of a(n)'s odd digits and leaving a(n)'s even digits even, then a(n+1) <= a(n) + s. (There may be a smaller solution a(n+1) whose sum of odd digits is smaller than s.) (End)

%e A340015 The 1st nonzero even term is 4 and 4 is the sum of the odd digits so far, 1 and 3;
