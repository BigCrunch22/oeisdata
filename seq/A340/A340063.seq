%N A340063 The primes appear in their natural order and the absolute difference between two successive primes is the sum of the digits between them.
%C A340063 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms with this property. It is conjectured that the sequence is a permutation of the integers > 1.
%H A340063 David A. Corneth, <a href="/A340063/b340063.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..8564</a> (terms < 10^999; first 515 terms from Carole Dubois)
%e A340063 prime 2 + (1) = prime 3;
%e A340063 prime 3 + (1+0 + 1+0+0) = prime 5; (we do not put 2 between 5 and 7 as 2 is in the sequence already and not 20 as 10 is lexicographically earlier along with 100 gives the digital sum 2).
%e A340063 prime 5 + (2+0) = prime 7;
%e A340063 prime 7 + (4) = prime 11;
%e A340063 prime 11 + (1+1+0) = prime 13;
%e A340063 prime 13 + (1+2 + 1+0+0+0) = 17; etc.
