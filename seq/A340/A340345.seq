%N A340345 a(n) is the smallest base of the form 2 + 10*k which is characterized by a convergence speed of n, where A317905(n) represents the convergence speed of m^^m.
%C A340345 Let n >= 1. For any t == 2 (mod 10), if 5^n divides (t^2 + 1) and 5^(n + 1) does not divide (t^2 + 1), then V(t) = n (where V(t) represents the convergence speed of t). In particular, the aforementioned property holds for any a(n), since a(n) belongs to the residue class 2 modulo 10 for any n. Moreover, 5^n always divides (a(n) + A337836(n)).
%C A340345 From _Marco Ripà_, Dec 31 2021: (Start)
%C A340345 In general, any tetration base m = A067251(n) which is congruent to {2,8}(mod 10) is characterized by a convergence speed equal to the 5-adic valuation of m^2 + 1. Similarly, if m is congruent to 4(mod 10), then the convergence speed of m is given by m + 1, whereas if m belongs to the congruence class 6 modulo 10, then its convergence speed is m - 1. Lastly, for any m congruent to 5 modulo 10, the congruence speed exceeds by 1 the 2-adic valuation of m^2 - 1.
%C A340345 Moreover, assuming m > 1, m^m is not congruent to m^m^m if and only if m belongs to the congruence class 2 modulo 20 or 18 modulo 20, whereas if m = A067251(n) is not coprime to 10 and is not equal to 5, then the number of new stable digits from m^m^m to m^m^m^m is always equal to the convergence speed of m. The aforementioned statement, in general, is untrue if m is coprime to 10 (see "Number of stable digits of any integer tetration" in the Links section).

%e A340345 For n = 4, a(4) = 182 is characterized by a convergence speed of 4, and it is the smallest base such that V(a) = 4. Moreover, 5 has to divide a(4)^2+1 exactly four times (i.e., a(4)^2+1 = 33125 = 5^4*53 is a multiple of 5^4 and is not divisible by 5^5).
