%N A340224 a(n+1) = a(n-a(n)*(a(n)-1)/2) + 1, starting with a(1) = 0.
%C A340224 To obtain the next term, compute the binomial(a,2) with the current term, then count back its value and add 1.
%C A340224 The sequence cannot repeat. Proof: Assume a finite period. Label an arbitrary term in the period x. Because of the back-referencing definition it follows that x-1 has to be in the period, and by the same argument so does x-2 and x-3, x-4, ... until 0. But it is not possible to obtain new 0s since each new term is larger than one already existing term.
%C A340224 Every positive integer appears in the sequence.
%C A340224 First occurrence of n: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, 20, 40, 47, 65, 87, 124, 170, 210, 258, 310, 389, 469, 548, 640, 758, 864, ...
%C A340224 The sequence appears to grow with the cube root of n, which is expected since f(x) = (6*x)^(1/3) satisfies the definition for large x, i.e., lim_{x->oo} f(x+1)-(f(x-f(x)*(f(x)-1)/2)+1) = 0.
%C A340224 Each term is determined by referencing an earlier term. Following the chain of these references we can uniquely trace back every term to the initial zero, e.g., a(40) -> a(24) -> a(17) -> a(13) -> a(11) -> a(9) -> a(8) -> a(1). These progressions form a tree, with the zero being at its root (for visualization see the Links section). The average branching factor B (number of links divided by the number of non-leaf nodes) is numerically evaluated to B = 1.380... (for n = 10^8). Considering the asymptotic behavior of the sequence a(n) ~ (6*n)^(1/3), we can expect that the number of links within a range (n,m) is asymptotically equal to m-n and therefore B is the inverse of the proportion of non-leaf terms (B = 1.380... then implies that roughly 27.5% of all terms never get referenced).
