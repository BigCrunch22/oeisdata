%N A340739 The stopping time sequence for the 3x+1 function, restricted to its range and adjusted. Each term is the number of iterations of the function until it decreases.
%C A340739 The sequence is column c in the link funct.pdf with obvious adjustments.
%C A340739 "Adjusted" means that, since for every four terms the first two are 1's they are omitted and then the sequence is relabeled. The 3x+1 function is defined:
%C A340739 For x a positive integer. f(x) := 3x + 1 with all positive powers of 2 remove.Note 1 is a fixed point of f.
%C A340739 The range of the 3x+1 function is two disjoint sets 6N+1 and 6N+5 for N nonnegative integers.
%C A340739 See the link to paper ammprob-f4-1-2, for a proof for range of the 3x+1 function.
%C A340739 Observations, Conjectures:
%C A340739 The famous 3x+1 problem would be solved if and only if ALL stopping time values are finite.
%C A340739 a(n)=2 iff Mod_{8}(n) is in {3, 6} a(n)=3 iff Mod_{16}(n) is in {7,9, 2,4} a(n)=4 iff Mod_{64}(n) is in {1,31,45,10,24,44}
%C A340739 a(n)=5 iff Mod_{128}(n) is in {13,29,33,49,63,79,101,16,56,72,76,79,92,106,122}
%C A340739 a(n)=6 iff Mod_{512}(n) is in {61,97,241,255,293,333,337,389,399,437,477,495,48,58,96,136,154,232,268,412,426,464,504,508}
%C A340739 Pattern seems to be a(n)=c iff there exist k and sets A,B such that
%C A340739 Mod_{2^k}(n) is in A union B, where |A|=|B| and A are odd and B are even numbers, where A is associated with 6N+1 and B with 6N+5.
%C A340739 Conjecture: Ultimately every positive integer appears in the stopping time sequence. (verified up to 100, examples:  a(6802394)=160, a(31229269)=161) And each positive integer is in the sequence an infinite number of times.
