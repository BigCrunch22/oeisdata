%N A340695 a(n) is the next perfect power after the earliest occurrence of n consecutive perfect powers, all of which are squares with exponents equal to 2.
%C A340695 The exponent of a(n) is > 2 thus terminating the progression of n consecutive preceding squares with exponents = 2 (A111245).
%C A340695 Is this sequence strictly increasing? - _David A. Corneth_, Jan 19 2021

%e A340695 From _David A. Corneth_, Jan 19 2021: (Start)
%e A340695 a(3) = 216 as in the perfect powers we see ..., 128 = 2^7, 144 = 12^2, 169 = 13^2, 196 = 14^2, 216 = 6^3, ... . We write them as powers of m^k where k is chosen as large as possible such that m and k are integers.
%e A340695 Then between two perfect powers with k > 2 (being 128 = 2^7 and 216 = 6^3) we have three consecutive perfect powers with k = 2. As 216 closes this earliest streak of 3, a(3) = 216. (End)
