%N A184156 The Wiener polarity index of the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number n.
%C A184156 The Wiener polarity index of a connected graph G is the number of unordered pairs {i,j} of vertices of G such that the distance between i and j is 3.
%C A184156 The Matula-Goebel number of a rooted tree is defined in the following recursive manner: to the one-vertex tree there corresponds the number 1; to a tree T with root degree 1 there corresponds the t-th prime number, where t is the Matula-Goebel number of the tree obtained from T by deleting the edge emanating from the root; to a tree T with root degree m>=2 there corresponds the product of the Matula-Goebel numbers of the m branches of T.

%F A184156 a(n) is the coefficient of x^3 in the Wiener polynomial of the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number n. The coefficients of these Wiener polynomials are given in A196059. The Maple program is based on the above.
%e A184156 a(7)=0 because the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number 7 is the rooted tree Y with no pair of vertices at distance 3.
%e A184156 a(11) = 2 because the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number 7 is a path on 5 vertices, say a, b, c, d, e, with each of the pairs {a,d} and {b,e} at distance 3.
