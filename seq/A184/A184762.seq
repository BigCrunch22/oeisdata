%N A184762 The number of numbers k > n such that Sum_{i=n..k} i^2 is a square.
%C A184762 It is an old result (see Watson) that for n=1 the only k>n is k=24. Bremner, Stroeker, and Tzanakis compute the k for n <= 100 by solving elliptic curves. This sequence lists the number of k for each n; the values of k are in A184763. Sequence A180442 lists the n for which a(n) is nonzero.
