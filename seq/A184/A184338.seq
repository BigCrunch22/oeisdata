%N A184338 "Types" (parities of i and j) when all the numbers ir+j are ranked, where r=golden ratio, i>=0, j>=0.
%F A184338 Let s(n)=i(n)*r+j(n) be the sequence obtained by arranging in increasing order all the numbers ir+j, where r is the golden mean ((1+sqrt(5))/2), and i>=0, j>=0.  Then
%F A184338 a(n)=1 if i(n) is odd and j(n) is odd (n in A183989);
%F A184338 a(n)=2 if i(n) is odd and j(n) is even (n in A183991);
%F A184338 a(n)=3 if i(n) is even and j(n) is odd (n in A183990);
%F A184338 a(n)=4 if i(n) is even and j(n) is even (n in A183992).
