%N A184997 Number of distinct remainders that are possible when a safe prime p is divided by n (for p > 2*n+1).
%C A184997 A number r could be a remainder of division p/n (for n > 0 and safe prime p > 2*n+1) if it satisfies two conditions:
%C A184997 1) r is coprime to n,
%C A184997 2) (r-1)/2 is coprime to n (assuming r-1 is even) or (n+r-1)/2 is coprime to n (assuming n+r-1 is even).
%C A184997 If one of these conditions isn't satisfied then either p or (p-1)/2 isn't a prime number.
%C A184997 If n1 and n2 are coprime then a(n1*n2) = a(n1)*a(n2), per the Chinese remainder theorem.

%e A184997 a(60) = 3 as there are only three distinct remainders possible (23, 47 and 59) when dividing some safe prime p by 60. It's true for all safe primes except 5, 7 and 11.
