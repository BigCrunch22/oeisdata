%N A184974 Number of connected 7-regular simple graphs on 2n vertices with girth exactly 4.

%F A184974 a(n) = A186714(n,5) - A186715(n,5).
%e A184974 a(0)=0 because even though the null graph (on zero vertices) is vacuously 7-regular and connected, since it is acyclic, it has infinite girth.
%e A184974 The a(7)=1 graph is the complete bipartite graph K_{7,7}.
%Y A184974 Connected k-regular simple graphs with girth exactly 4: A006924 (k=3), A184944 (k=4), A184954 (k=5), A184964 (k=6), this sequence (k=7).
%Y A184974 Connected 7-regular simple graphs with girth at least g: A014377 (g=3), A181153 (g=4).
%Y A184974 Connected 7-regular simple graphs with girth exactly g: A184973 (g=3), this sequence (g=4).
