%N A264482 Triangle T(n,k) (1 <= k <= n) read by rows: row n lists the set of n coprime numbers that minimizes the difference between first and last terms, and then minimizes the average of the terms.
%C A264482 The minimal set of the (k+n)th row is determined by the minimal k-tuple coprime to the n-th primorial, where every prime <= the n-th prime must be a factor of some number in the set. E.g., the sixth row must consist of numbers congruent to 5, 7, 11 and 13 mod 6, as well as one term with a factor of 2 and another with a factor of 3.
%C A264482 In cases where multiple k-tuples satisfy the definition, the lexicographically earliest solution is chosen.
%C A264482 Are there infinitely many rows that start with 1?
