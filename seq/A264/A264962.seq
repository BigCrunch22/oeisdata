%N A264962 Pulsating Checkpoint Sequence: use powers of 2 as checkpoints; place powers of 2, starting with 4, with spacing equal to the previous power of 2. Whenever we encounter a checkpoint, we jump over it; otherwise, we insert four numbers into the sequence: 2p, p, 3p, and 3p+3, where p is the smallest odd prime not yet in the sequence.
%C A264962 The checkpoints, which are the numbers 4, 8, 16, 32, etc., are placed so that the number 2^k is located at the (2^k + k - 5)th position in the sequence, for k>=2; thus:
%C A264962    4 = 2^2 = a(2^2 + 2 - 5) = a( 4 + 2 - 5) = a(1);
%C A264962    8 = 2^3 = a(2^3 + 3 - 5) = a( 8 + 3 - 5) = a(6);
%C A264962   16 = 2^4 = a(2^4 + 4 - 5) = a(16 + 4 - 5) = a(15);
%C A264962   32 = 2^5 = a(2^5 + 5 - 5) = a(32 + 5 - 5) = a(32); etc.
%C A264962 The number of terms that will be placed between successive checkpoints 2^k and 2^(k+1) is (2^(k+1) + (k+1) - 5) - (2^k + k - 5) - 1 = 2^k for each k>=2; i.e., there will be 4 terms placed between 4 and 8, 8 terms placed between 8 and 16, 16 terms placed between 16 and 32, etc
%C A264962 Not every positive integer greater than four will appear in this sequence. If p and q are two consecutive primes with |p-q|>2, then the numbers from (p+2)*3 to (q-1)*3 will not occur in this sequence. No number of the form 2^k*m, where k>1 and m is an odd number not divisible by 3, will occur in this sequence (for example, 20, 28). Also, the numbers of form t^k, where t>3 is an odd prime and k>1 will not occur in this sequence (for example, 25, 49).
%C A264962 No two adjacent terms will share more than one prime factor.

%e A264962 We begin by placing successive powers of 2, starting with 2^2 = 4, with spacing equal to the value of the previous power of 2, in the sequence as checkpoints:
%e A264962 .
%e A264962 .|4 terms|
%e A264962 .|<----->| |<-- 8 terms -->|  |<---------- 16 terms --------->|
%e A264962 4,_,_,_,_,8,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,16,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,32,...
%e A264962 Then we fill in the remaining locations sequentially, jumping over each checkpoint as we encounter it. Those remaining locations are filled in sequentially, in sets of four terms at a time (i.e., in quadruples). We begin inserting the quadruples of the form {2p, p, 3p, 3p+3}, where p in the j-th quadruple inserted is the j-th odd prime; thus, the first quadruple is {2*3, 3, 3*3, 3*3+3} = {6,3,9,12}, and inserting it gives
%e A264962 4,6,3,9,12,8,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,16,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,32,...
%e A264962 Now we jump over the checkpoint 8 and insert the next two quadruples (which have p=5 and p=7, respectively):
%e A264962 4,6,3,9,12,8,10,5,15,18,14,7,21,24,16,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,_,32,...
%e A264962 Continuing as above, we insert the next 4 quadruples (16 terms) after the checkpoint term 16, the next 8 quadruples (32 terms) after the checkpoint term 32, etc.
%Y A264962 Cf. A000040, A000079. Graph shape is similar to A064413.
