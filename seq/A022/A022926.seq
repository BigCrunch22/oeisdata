%N A022926 Number of powers of 7 between 2^n and 2^(n+1).
%F A022926 a(n) = floor(log_7 2^(n + 1)) - floor(log_7 2^n). - _Alonso del Arte_, Nov 04 2018
%e A022926 Between 2^2 and 2^3 there is only one power of 7, which is 7 itself. Hence a(2) = 1.
%e A022926 Between 2^3 and 2^4 there are no powers of 7, so a(3) = 0.
