%N A022440 a(n) = c(n-1) + c(n-3) where c is the sequence of positive numbers not in a.
%C A022440 From _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 24 2004: I'm not sure of the minimal hypotheses needed to generate this sequence, but one method that works is the following:
%C A022440 Start with a(1)=3, a(2)=4, a(3)=5, so that we know c(1)=1 and c(2)=2. Let c(3) = x >= 6, so that a(4) = 1+x >= 6 and x=6 is forced, with a(4)=7. Then c(4) >= 8, a(5) >= 10, so definitely c(4)=8 and c(5)=9. From now on the sequence extends easily.
