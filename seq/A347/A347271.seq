%N A347271 Irregular triangle T(n,k) read by rows in which row n lists the terms of the 3x+1 trajectory of n, but the row ends when a term is a power of 2 or when a term is less than n, with n >= 1 and k >= 0.
%C A347271 Note that every row ends when it is easy to know the next missing terms because they are powers of 2 or the last term and the next missing terms form a row that it is already in the sequence.
%C A347271 For a square array with infinitely many terms in every row, see A347270, which is a supersequence that contains all 3x+1 sequences.
