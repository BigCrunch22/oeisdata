%N A347414 Number of partitions of n which occur as the automorphism orbit sizes of a rooted forest of n vertices.
%C A347414 Also, the number of partitions of n+1 which occur as the automorphism orbit sizes of a rooted tree of n+1 vertices, since the tree root is alone in its orbit and a tree without its root is a forest.

%e A347414 For n=9, one of the partitions counted is 1+1+1+2+2+2 = 9 which is the orbit sizes of the following forest (and various other forests too):
%e A347414   roots:       a       c       orbit: a  b  c  d  e  f
