%N A347243 Numbers k such that when iterating the map x -> A000593(x), we will not encounter a term x (after the starting point x=k) whose largest prime factor would be at least as large as A006530(k), before 1 is eventually reached.
%C A347243 The initial 1 is included by a convention.
%e A347243 For n = 17, the iteration proceeds as follows 17 -> 18 (= 2*3*3), 18 -> 13 (13 is a prime), 13 -> 14 (= 2*7), 14 -> 8 (= 2*2*2), 8 -> 1. The largest prime factor present after the initial step is 13, which is less than the largest prime factor of 17 (which is 17 itself), thus 17 is included in this sequence.
