%N A347862 Total number of polygons left out in all partitions of the set of vertices of a convex n-gon into nonintersecting polygons.
%e A347862 a(3) = a(4) = a(5) = 0 since the only partition of the vertices of a triangle, quadrilateral or pentagon into polygons is the full polygon so nothing is left out.
%e A347862 a(6) = 3 since the vertices of a hexagon can be partitioned into two non-intersecting triangles in A350248(6,2) = 3 ways and in each of these cases a quadrilateral is left over.
%e A347862 When partitioning the set of vertices of a convex 13-gon into 1 polygon, the number of polygons remaining is 0.
%e A347862 When partitioning it into 2 polygons, the remaining polygons are 52 quadrilaterals.
%e A347862 When partitioning it into 3 polygons, the remaining polygons are 65 hexagons + 650 quadrilaterals.
%e A347862 When partitioning it into 4 polygons, the remaining polygons are 13 octagons + 117 hexagons + 585 quadrilaterals.
%e A347862 This gives the total as 1482 polygons.
