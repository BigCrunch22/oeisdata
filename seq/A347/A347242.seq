%N A347242 Numbers k such that when iterating the map x -> A000593(x), at some point before 1 is reached (after starting from x=k), a term is encountered whose largest prime factor is at least as large as A006530(k).
%C A347242 Provided there do not exist any odd perfect numbers, these are numbers k for which A347240(k) >= A006530(k), as for any odd perfect number x, A347240(x) = -1 by its escape clause.
%C A347242 If k is included as a term, then 2*k is also present.
%C A347242 Not all odd squares of primes are present. For example, 67^2 and 79^2 are not included. See also A091490, which seems to be a subsequence of those exceptions.
%C A347242 Conjecture: There are no primes in this sequence. Checked up to the 2^20-th prime, 16290047.

%e A347242 For n = 55 = 5*11, on the first iteration we get A000593(55) = 72 = 2^3 * 3^2, but both 2 and 3 are less than 11; therefore we iterate a second time to get A000593(72) = 13, which is the first value whose largest prime factor is larger than that of 55 (13 > 11), thus 55 is included in the sequence.
