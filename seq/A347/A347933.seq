%N A347933 Positive integers that can't be written in the form a+b+c for some positive integers a, b, and c satisfying gcd(a,b)=1, gcd(a,c)>1, and gcd(b,c)>1.

%e A347933 1 and 2 are the first two terms of the sequence because they can't even be written as sums of three positive integers.
%e A347933 3 is the third term of the sequence because there is only one way to express it as a sum of three positive integers (1+1+1).
%e A347933 11 does not belong to the sequence because 11=2+3+6 (and gcd(2,3)=1, gcd(2,6)=2, and gcd(3,6)=3).
