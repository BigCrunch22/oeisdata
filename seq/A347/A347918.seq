%N A347918 Irregular table read by rows: The number of k-faced polyhedra, where k >= 4, formed when a row of n adjacent cubes are internally cut by all the planes defined by any three of their vertices.
%C A347918 See A347753 for an explanation of the sequence and additional images.
%C A347918 See A333539 and A338622 for images of the single cube.
%H A347918 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A347918/a347918.png">Image showing the 319416 different k-faced polyhedra for 4 adjacent cubes</a>. The 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, and 9-faced polyhedra are colored red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo respectively. The 10-, 11-, and 12-faced polyhedra, which are not visible on the surface and are shown together, are colored violet, white, black.
%F A347918 Sum of row n = A347753(n)
%e A347918 The single cube, row 1, is internally cut with 14 planes which creates seventy-two 4-faced polyhedra and twenty-four 5-faced polyhedra. See also A333539.
