%N A347769 a(0) = 0; a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) = A001065(a(n-1)) = sigma(a(n-1)) - a(n-1) (the sum of aliquot parts of a(n-1)) if this is not yet in the sequence; otherwise a(n) is the smallest number missing from the sequence.
%C A347769 This sequence is a permutation of the nonnegative integers iff Catalan's aliquot sequence conjecture (also called Catalan-Dickson conjecture) is true.
%C A347769 a(563) = 276 is the smallest number whose aliquot sequence has not yet been fully determined.
%C A347769 As long as the aliquot sequence of 276 is not known to be finite or eventually periodic, a(563+k) = A008892(k).
