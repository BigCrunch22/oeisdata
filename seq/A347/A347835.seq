%N A347835 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct terms > 0 such that the a(a(n))-th digit of S is the n-th digit of Pi.
%e A347835 The  2nd digit of S is 3 and if n = 1 then a(1) =  2 and a(a(1)) = 3.
%e A347835 The  3rd digit of S is 1 and if n = 2 then a(2) =  3 and a(a(2)) = 1.
%e A347835 The 10th digit of S is 4 and if n = 3 then a(3) = 10 and a(a(3)) = 4.
%e A347835 The  6th digit of S is 1 and if n = 4 then a(4) =  6 and a(a(4)) = 1.
%e A347835 The 11th digit of S is 5 and if n = 5 then a(5) = 11 and a(a(5)) = 5.
%e A347835 The  9th digit of S is 9 and if n = 6 then a(6) = 94 and a(a(6)) = 9.
%e A347835 The 94th digit of S is 2 and if n = 7 then a(7) =  5 and a(a(7)) = 2, etc.
%e A347835 We see above that the leftmost column of integers forms the sequence S and the rightmost column of digits forms the successive digits of Pi.
