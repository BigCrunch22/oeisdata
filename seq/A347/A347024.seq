%N A347024 There are a(n) digits between a(n) and the next copy of the string a(n) read backwards. This is the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms with this property.
%e A347024 a(1) = 1; there is 1 digit between a(1) and the "1" of 10: this is the digit 2;
%e A347024 a(2) = 2; there are 2 digits between a(2) and the "2" of 20: they are 1 and 0;
%e A347024 a(3) = 10; there are 10 digits between a(3) and the next string "01" (formed by the terms "400, 17"): they are 2, 0, 3, 4, 7, 8, 3, 0, 4 and 0;
%e A347024 a(4) = 20; there are 20 digits between a(4) and the next string "02" (formed by the terms "100, 26"): they are 3, 4, 7, 8, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0, 1, 7, 5, 8, 0, 9, 6, 1, 5, 1 and 0;
%e A347024 a(5) = 3; there are 3 digits between a(5) and the "3" of 30: they are 4, 7 and 8;
%e A347024 a(6) = 4; there are 4 digits between a(6) and the "4" of 400: they are 7, 8, 3 and 0;
%e A347024 a(7) = 7; there are 7 digits between a(7) and the "7" of 17: they are 8, 3, 0, 4, 0, 0 and 1; etc.
