%N A347698 a(n) = n - A337125(n).
%C A347698 The graph of A337125 is typical of many that look like a straight line with small irregularities. So much of the information is in the sequence of irregularities, which are shown here. This also shows that the original sequence was not as close to the line y=x as it appeared. (Of course this is explained by the asymptotic bounds given in A337125.)
