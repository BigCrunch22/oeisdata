%N A347751 Number of finite edges in the graph formed when every pair of vertices of a row of n adjacent congruent rectangles are joined by an infinite line.
%C A347751 See A344993 and A347750 for images of the rectangles.
%F A347751 a(n) = A344993(n) + A347750(n) - 1.
%e A347751 a(1) = 8 as connecting the four vertices of a single rectangle forms four new edges inside the rectangle, giving a total of 4 + 4 = 8 total edges.
%e A347751 a(2) = 36 as connecting the six vertices of two adjacent rectangles forms twenty-two edges inside the rectangles while also forming eight edges outside the rectangles. The total number of edges is then 6 + 22 + 8 = 36.
%Y A347751 Cf. A344993 (number of polygons), A347750 (number of intersections), A331757 (number of edges on or inside the rectangles).
