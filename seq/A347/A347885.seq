%N A347885 Odd numbers k such that sigma(k^2) has an odd number of prime factors when counted with multiplicity.
%C A347885 Equally, odd numbers k such that A003415(sigma(k^2)) is odd, i.e., k^2 is in A347877. See A235991.
%C A347885 A square root of any hypothetical odd square x present in A005820 (triperfect numbers) would be a member of this sequence, because bigomega(x) would be even, and bigomega(3*x) would be odd. See also A347887.
