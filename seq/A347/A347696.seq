%N A347696 Length of longest sequence of directed edges in the graph G (see Comments) that starts at node n.
%C A347696 Let G be the directed graph with vertices labeled by the nonnegative integers and with an edge out of vertex n for each 0 in the binary representation of n (excluding leading zeros). If the 2^s term in n is 0, then the corresponding edge goes from vertex n to vertex n - 2^s.
%C A347696 Thus from vertex 12 = 1100_2 there are outgoing edges to vertex 11 = 12 - 1 and to vertex 10 = 12 - 2.
%C A347696 Then a(n) is the length of the longest sequence of edges starting at vertex n.
%C A347696 If we replace "0" by "1" in the definition, the analogous sequence is A000120. - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Oct 10 2021.
