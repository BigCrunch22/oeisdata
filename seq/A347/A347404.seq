%N A347404 a(1) = 3; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest distinct positive integer such that gcd(a(n), a(n-k)) > 1 for each divisor k of a(n) such that k < n.
%C A347404 The majority of terms are concentrated along a line whose slope is approximately 1.3. Occasionally though there are terms which correspond to the smallest unused number up to that point, and these tend to lead to a subsequent very large term. For example a(499) = 628, a(500) = 682, a(501) = 31, a(502) = 14322. Other large terms appear seemingly at random, for example a(15449) = 19880, a(15450) = 19099, a(15451) = 74962230.
%C A347404 It is likely all numbers > 1 eventually appear. The smallest number not seen after 20000 terms is 89.
%C A347404 Note that if the sequence starts with 2 then the terms are just all the increasing even numbers.

%e A347404 a(2) = 6. As a(1) = 3 the next term must be a multiple of 3, and the smallest unused such number is 6. Note that as a(2-2), a(2-3) and a(2-6) are not defined these are ignored.
%e A347404 a(7) = 10. As a(6) = 18 the next term must have 2 and/or 3 as divisors. If it has 2 as a divisor is must also have 3 and/or 5 as a divisor as a(8-2) = a(6) = 15. The smallest unused number satisfying these is 10. Note that as 5 is a divisor of 10 it must be that a(7-5) = a(2) = 6 has 2 or 5 as a divisor, which is true.
%e A347404 a(8) = 2. As a(7) = 10 the next term must have 2 and/or 5 as a divisor. As a(6) = 18 also has 2 as a divisor a(8) = 2 is the next smallest unused term.
