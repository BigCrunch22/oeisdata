%N A347470 Least product of any two numbers whose concatenation is n, excluding 0*n for n > 9.
%C A347470 Leading zeros are not allowed: e.g., 101 = concat(10,1) but not concat(1,01). Although 0 is a valid number, we don't allow the trivial decomposition n = concat(0, n) except for the single-digit n < 10, otherwise the minimal product would always be 0.
%C A347470 For n < 111, this sequence coincides with A035930 (same with "largest"), because there is only one possible concatenation, but it differs for n > 111, cf. examples.

%e A347470 The number n = 112 is the concatenation of 1 and 12, or of 11 and 2, with respective products 1*12 = 12 and 11*2 = 22. Hence, a(112) = 12, while A035930(112) = 22.

%Y A347470 Cf. A035930, A007954, A088117, A171765 and A257297.
