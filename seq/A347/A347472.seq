%N A347472 Maximum number of nonzero entries allowed in an n X n matrix to ensure there is a 2 X 2 zero submatrix.
%C A347472 Related to Zarankiewicz's problem k_2(n) (cf. A001197 and other crossrefs) which asks the converse: how many 1's must be in an n X n {0,1}-matrix in order to guarantee the existence of an all-ones 2 X 2 submatrix. This complementarity leads to the given formula which was used to compute the given values.
%C A347472 See A347473 and A347474 for the similar problem with a 3 X 3 resp. 4 X 4 zero submatrix.
%F A347472 a(n) = n^2 - A001197(n).
%F A347472 a(n) = A350296(n) - 1. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Dec 23 2021
%e A347472 For n = 2, there must not be any nonzero entry in an n X n = 2 X 2 matrix, if one wants a 2 X 2 zero submatrix, whence a(2) = 0.
%e A347472 For n = 3, having at most 2 nonzero entries in the n X n matrix still guarantees that there is a 2 X 2 zero submatrix (delete the row of the first nonzero entry and then the column of the remaining nonzero entry, if any), but if one allows 3 nonzero entries and they are placed on the diagonal, then there is no 2 X 2 zero submatrix. Hence, a(3) = 2.
