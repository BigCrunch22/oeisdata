%N A347391 Numbers k such that sigma(k) is either their sibling in Doudna tree (A005940), or one of the sibling's descendants.
%C A347391 Numbers k > 1 such that nearest common ancestor of k and sigma(k) in Doudna tree is the parent of k, and sigma(k) is not a descendant of k.
%C A347391 Any hypothetical odd term x in A005820 (triperfect numbers) would also be a member of this sequence. This is illustrated in the following diagram which shows how the neighborhood of such x would look like in the Doudna tree (A005940). If m (the parent of x, x = A003961(m), m = A064989(x)) is even, then x is a multiple of 3, while if m is odd, then 3 does not divide x. Because the abundancy index decreases when traversing leftwards in the Doudna tree, m must be a term of A068403. Both x and m would also need to be squares, by necessity.

%C A347391 .
%C A347391 From the diagram we also see that 2x would then need to be a term of A347392 (as well as that of A159907 and also in A074388, thus sqrt(x) should be a term of A097023), and furthermore, if x is not a multiple of 3 (i.e., when m is odd), then sigma(3*x) = 4*sigma(x) = 4*(3*x), thus 3*x = sigma(x) would be a term of A336702 (particularly, in A027687) and x would be a term of A323653.
%C A347391 Moreover, any odd square x in this sequence (for which sigma(x) would also be odd), would have an abundancy index of at least three (sigma(x)/x >= 3). See comments in A347383.
%C A347391 Note how 401625 = 6375 * 63 = 945 * 425, 46305 = 945 * 49, 9261 = 189 * 49, 6375 = 2125 * 3, 945 = 189 * 5 = 15 * 63 and 9261*2125 = 19679625. It seems that when the multiplicands are coprime, then they are both terms of this sequence, e.g. 2125 and 3, 189 and 5, 2125 and 9261.
%C A347391 Question: from a(6) = 189 onward, are the rest of terms all in A347390?
%C A347391 Conjecture: sequence is finite.
%C A347391 If it exists, a(14) > 2^33.
