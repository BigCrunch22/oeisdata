%N A347890 Odd numbers k such that sigma(k) > 2*k and A003415(sigma(k)) < k, where A003415 is the arithmetic derivative, and sigma is the sum of divisors function.
%C A347890 Odd numbers k such that A033880(k) is positive but A342926(k) is negative.
%C A347890 This is a subsequence of A156942, "odd abundant numbers whose abundance is odd". Proof: If sigma(k) > 2*k, and sigma(k) were even, then sigma(k)/2 would be an integer and a divisor of sigma(k), and we could compute A003415(sigma(k)) as A003415(2)*(sigma(k)/2) + 2*A003415(sigma(k)/2) by the definition of the arithmetic derivative. But that value is certainly larger than k, because sigma(k)/2 > k, therefore sigma(k) must be an odd number, with also its abundance sigma(k)-(2k) odd. This also entails that all terms are squares. See A347891 for the square roots.
%C A347890 The first term that is not a multiple of 25 is a(146) = 6800806089 = 82467^2.
%C A347890 This is not a subsequence of A325311. The first term that is not present there is a(5) = 3080025.

%o A347890 \\ Using the program given in A347891 would be much faster than this:
%o A347890 A003415(n) = if(n<=1, 0, my(f=factor(n)); n*sum(i=1, #f~, f[i, 2]/f[i, 1]));

%Y A347890 Intersection of A005231 and A343216.
%Y A347890 Subsequence of A016754, of A156942 and of A347889 (its odd terms).
%Y A347890 Cf. A000203, A003415, A033880, A325311, A342926, A347891 (the square roots).
