%N A347062 Record the number of zero terms having a following term, then the number of terms equal to 1 having a following term, then 2, 3, etc. until recording a zero, whereupon the count is reset.
%C A347062 Inventory sequence recording the number of existing terms immediately following occurrences of a zero term, then the number immediately following occurrences of 1, then 2, and so on until another zero is recorded, after which the count is reset. Inclusion of a term in any count requires it to have been followed by another term first, therefore lead terms are not included in the current count.
%C A347062 The scatterplot exhibits trajectories attributable to the register of occurrences of the immediately-preceding term m, c(m), and irregular periodicity of nondecreasing length. - _Michael De Vlieger_, Oct 16 2021

%e A347062 At first there are no terms, thus none following a zero, so a(0) = 0.
%e A347062 After a(0) = 0 the count is reset, and since there are still no terms following a zero, a(1) = 0. The count is now reset again and we have one term a(1) = 0 which follows a zero term, so a(2) = 1.
%e A347062 We now have 0,0,1 and because no term yet follows 1, a(3) must be 0 (the lead term here is 1 but it is not counted).
%e A347062 The count is now reset and there are two terms (a(1) and a(2)) which follow a zero term, thus a(4) = 2; etc.
