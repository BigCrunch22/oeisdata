%N A347522 The prime numbers visited on a square spiral when starting at 1 and then stepping to the smallest unvisited prime number that is not visible from the current number.
%C A347522 A number is not visible from the current number if, given it has coordinates (x,y) relative to the current number, the greatest common divisor of |x| and |y| is greater than 1.
%C A347522 As n increases the vast majority of primes are on the same square ring of numbers as the current prime. However occasionally, especially for primes inside the right side quadrant, the next prime is on an outer or inner ring which causes the step to make a diagonal line. See the linked images. The largest diagonal step after 50000 terms is one at step 43936 between primes 532981 and 531457 which is seen as the long violet diagonal line from the top-left to the bottom-right in the image for these terms. No other such diagonal line is seen up to 10^6 terms.
