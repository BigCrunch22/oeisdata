%N A347280 Let P1>3, P2, P3, P4 be 4 consecutive primes with P3-P2 = 2. a(n) = P2 is the earliest occurrence of the 4-tuple with min(P2-P1, P4-P3) = 2*n, or 0 if no such constellation exists.
%C A347280 The "irregular" constellation 3, 5, 7, 11 is intentionally excluded.

%e A347280 a(2) = 11, because min(11-7, 17-13) = 4 is the earliest occurrence of the minimum gap of 2*2 = 4 adjacent to a pair of twin primes.
%e A347280 a(3) = 29: the constellation 23, 29, 31, 37 has min(29-23, 37-31) = 2*3 = 6, whereas the preceding constellations 7, 11, 13, 19, and 13, 17, 19, 23 don't yield a minimum of 6.
%e A347280 a(5) = 419: 409, 419, 421, 431 leads to the earliest occurrence of the minimum adjacent gap of 2*5.
%Y A347280 Subset of A001359.
