%N A347247 Numbers k such that the greatest prime factor of A000593(k) [the sum of their odd divisors] is at least as large as the greatest prime factor of k itself.
%C A347247 The initial 1 is included on the grounds that A006530(1) = 1 and A000593(1) = 1. After 1, if k is included as a term, then also 2*k is present.
%C A347247 A038838(27) = 153 is the first term of A038838 not present here.
%Y A347247 Cf. A000593, A006530, A347246 (characteristic function), A347248 (complement).
%Y A347247 Apart from the initial 1, a subsequence of A347242.
%Y A347247 Cf. also A038838.
