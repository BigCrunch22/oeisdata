%N A347337 The prime numbers ordered by their distance from the origin of a square spiral which starts at 1. If two or more primes have the same distance from the origin the smaller prime appears first.
%e A347337 The square spiral is numbered as follows:

%e A347337 .
%e A347337 a(1) = 2 as this is the only prime a distance of 1 unit from the origin.
%e A347337 a(2) = 3, a(3) = 5, a(4) = 7. All of these primes are a distance of
%e A347337 sqrt(2) units from the origin, so they are listed with the smaller primes first.
%e A347337 a(6) = 19 as this is 2 units from the origin, the same as a(5) = 11. This is the first prime that appears out of natural order as both 13 and 17 are sqrt(8) units, which is greater than 2 units, from the origin.
