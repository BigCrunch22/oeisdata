%N A347063 Double Zumkeller numbers: numbers whose set of divisors can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets with equal sums and equal cardinalities.
%C A347063 If x is a Zumkeller number, then so is 2x. Conjecturally, if y is a term of this sequence, then so is 2y.
%C A347063 If y is a term of this sequence, then so is p*y, where p is a prime that is coprime to y. Proof: Let D = {d_1,d_2,...,d_k} be the set of divisors of y. Let E be the set of divisors of p*y. Except for the divisors of y E contains their products with p. In other words, E = {d_1,d_2,...,d_2k}, meaning that the cardinality of E is twice the cardinality of D. Those additional divisors are F = {p*d_1,p*d_2,...,p*d_k}. Since D can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets with equal sums and cardinalities by definition, this must be true about F and also about E = D union F. QED. - _Ivan N. Ianakiev_, Nov 20 2021
%C A347063 It seems that for k>=1 all numbers of the form 18k+12 are terms. Verified for k in [1, 45]. - _Ivan N. Ianakiev_, Oct 01 2024
%e A347063 The set of divisors of 24 is D = {1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24}. D = {1,2,3,24} union {4,6,8,12}, so 24 is in the sequence.
