%N A347258 Number of fixed hexagonal polyominoes with n cells that have a horizontal axis of symmetry that is a diagonal of at least one of the n cells.
%C A347258 These are polyominoes of the Euclidean hexagonal regular tiling with Schl√§fli symbol {6,3}. This is one of three sequences needed to calculate the number of achiral polyominoes, A030225. The three sequences together contain exactly two copies of each achiral polyomino. This sequence can be calculated using a modification of Redelmeier's method; one chooses an original cell that is leftmost on and bisected by the axis of symmetry along a horizontal diagonal. Neighbors are added only if their centers are above the axis of symmetry or on the axis of symmetry to the right of the original cell. Cells not centered on the axis of symmetry are counted twice to include their reflections.
