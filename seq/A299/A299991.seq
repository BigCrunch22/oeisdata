%N A299991 Numbers n for which A243822(n) > A000005(n).
%C A299991 Composite numbers m have nondivisors k in the cototient such that k | n^e with e > 1. These k appear in row n of A272618 and are enumerated by A243822(n). These nondivisors k are a kind of "regular" number along with divisors d of n; both are listed in row n of A162306 and are together enumerated by A010846(n).
%C A299991 This sequence lists numbers that have more nondivisors k in the cototient of n than divisors d.
%C A299991 This sequence contains all n for which A299990(n) is positive.
%C A299991 The smallest odd term is 165.
%C A299991 For m >= 3, A002110(m) is in a(n).
%C A299991 For m >= 9, A244052(m) is in a(n).
