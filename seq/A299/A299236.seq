%C A299236 Suppose that S is a set of real numbers. An S-power-tower, t, is a number t = x(1)^x(2)^...^x(k), where k >= 1 and x(i) is in S for i = 1..k. We represent t by (x(1), x(2), ..., x(k)), which for k > 1 is defined as (x(1), (x(2), ..., x(k))); (2,3,2) means 2^9. The number k is the *height* of t. If every element of S exceeds 1 and all the power towers are ranked in increasing order, the position of each in the resulting sequence is its *rank*. See A299229 for a guide to related sequences.
%C A299236 Every nonnegative integer occurs infinitely many times in the sequence. In particular, a(n) = 0 when the tower consists exclusively of 2's. The position of the n-th 0 in the sequence is the rank of the n-th {2}-power tower, given by 7*2^(n-3) - 1 for n > 2.
