%N A299791 2-provable primes: Primes p expressible as x+y, where the prime factors of x and y are precisely the primes less than sqrt(p).
%C A299791 There cannot be any terms > 169 because the least possible value for x+y once 13 is included in the set of prime factors is 347 > 17^2. For p > 347, the list of factors required in x or y also includes 17, pushing the minimal p to 1429 (714 + 715). This in turn adds the next 5 primes to the list, pushing the minimal value of x+y exponentially upward relative to p.
%e A299791 The primes less than sqrt(167) are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11, and 167 = 2*3*3*5 + 7*11, so 167 is in this sequence.
