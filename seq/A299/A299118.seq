%N A299118 Squares s such that prime(s) + 2 is a square.
%C A299118 Primes corresponding to the first four squares are 2, 7, 23, and 136866599. The sequence may be finite.
%C A299118 There may be no square s such that prime(s) + 1 is square (none was found up to 10^9).
%C A299118 This is a Diophantine problem of the form f(n^2) + A = m^2, where f(x) = prime(x), and the simplest case of A = 1 has probably no solutions unlike the same case with f(x) = primepi(x) that may even have an infinite number of solutions.
%e A299118 prime(4) + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9, and both 4 and 9 are squares.
