%N A299483 Irregular triangle read by rows in which row n lists the odd divisors of n in increasing order together with the even divisors of n in decreasing order.
%C A299483 Consider the diagram with overlapping periodic curves that appears in the Links section (figure 1). The number of curves that contain the point [n,0] equals the number of divisors of n. The simpler interpretation of the diagram is that the curve of diameter d represents the divisor d of n. Now here we introduce a new interpretation: the curve of diameter d that contains the point [n,0] represents the divisor c of n, where c = n/d. This model has the property that each odd quadrant centered at [n,0] contains the curves that represent the even divisors of n, and each even quadrant centered at [n,0] contains the curves that represent the odd divisors of n.
%C A299483 We can find the n-th row of the triangle as follows:
%C A299483 Consider only the semicircumferences that contain the point [n,0].
%C A299483 In the second quadrant from top to bottom we can see the curves that represent the odd divisors of n in increasing order. Also we can see these curves in the fourth quadrant from bottom to top.
%C A299483 Then, if n is an even number, in the first quadrant from bottom to top we can see the curves that represent the even divisors of n in decreasing order. Also we can see these curves in the third quadrant from top to bottom (see example).

%e A299483 For n = 12 the divisors of 12 are [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]. The odd divisors of 12 in increasing order are [1, 3], and the even divisors of 12 in decreasing order are [12, 6, 4, 2], so the 12th row of triangle is [1, 3, 12, 6, 4, 2].
%e A299483 On the other hand, consider the diagram that appears in the Links section (figure 1). Then consider only the semicircumferences that contain the point [12,0]. In the second quadrant, from top to bottom, we can see the curves with diameters [12, 4]. Also we can see these curves in the fourth quadrant from bottom to top. The associated numbers c = 12/d are [1, 3] respectively. These are the odd divisors of 12 in increasing order. Then, in the first quadrant, from bottom to top, we can see the curves with diameters [1, 2, 3, 6]. Also we can see these curves in the third quadrant from top the bottom. The associated numbers c = 12/d are [12, 6, 4, 2] respectively. These are the even divisors of n in decreasing order. Finally all numbers c obtained are [1, 3, 12, 6, 4, 2] equaling the 12th row of triangle.
