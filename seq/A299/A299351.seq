%N A299351 For x=n, iterate the map x -> Product_{k is a prime dividing x} (k + 1), a(n) is the number of steps to see a repeated term for the first time.
%C A299351 It appears that all n end in the orbit (3,4) or the fixed point 12, verified to n=10^8.
%C A299351 Let p,q,r,... be primes that increased by 1 become a power of 2 (the Mersenne primes, A000668). Then for n = p^a*q^b*r^c*..., a,b,c,...>=1 -> (p+1)*(q+1)*(r+1)... = 2^e, e>=2 -> (2+1)=3.
%C A299351 The case 3^k, k>=2 first yields 4 and then 3: -> (3+1)=4=2^2 -> (2+1)=3.
%C A299351 It appears that these are the only ones entering the orbit (3,4), all other n end in the fixed point 12.

%e A299351 For n=2: 2 -> (2+1)=3 -> (3+1)=4=2^2 -> (2+1)=3; 3 is repeated so a(2)=3.
%e A299351 For n=19: 19 -> (19+1)=20=2^2*5 -> (2+1)*(5+1)=18=2*3^2 -> (2+1)*(3+1)=12=2^2*3 -> (2+1)*(3+1)=12; 12 is repeated so a(19)=4.
