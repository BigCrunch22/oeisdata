%N A299992 Composite n with A001221(n) > 1 for which A243822(n) < A000005(n).
%C A299992 Composite numbers m have nondivisors k in the cototient such that k | n^e with e > 1. These k appear in row n of A272618 and are enumerated by A243822(n). These nondivisors k are a kind of "regular" number along with divisors d of n; both are listed in row n of A162306 and are together enumerated by A045763(n).
%C A299992 Primes p have 2 divisors {1, p}; these two numbers constitute the cototient of p: there are no nondivisors in the cototient.
%C A299992 Prime powers p^i have (i + 1) divisors; all smaller powers of the same prime p, i.e., p^j with 0 <= j <= i, also divide p^i. These numbers constitute the cototient of p^i; there are no nondivisors in the cototient.
%C A299992 Therefore, we can ignore cases where n has no nondivisors in the cototient, since they obviously have more divisors than nondivisors therein.
%C A299992 This sequence lists (composite) numbers n with omega(n) > 1 that have fewer nondivisors k in the cototient of n than divisors d.
%C A299992 The smallest odd term is 15.
%C A299992 The number m = 1001 is the smallest term with A001221(m) = 3. No term less than 36,000,000 has A001221(m) > 3.
%C A299992 The following terms m are the smallest to have A001222(m) = {2, 3, 4, ...}: {6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384, 1152, 2304, 4608, 13824, 27648, 55296, 110592, 331776, 663552, 1327104, 3981312, 7962624, 15925248, ...}
%C A299992 Number of terms less than 10^k for 0 <= k <= 7: {0, 2, 44, 319, 2171, 15545, 119469, 969749}.

%e A299992 6 is the first term since it is the smallest number with more than one distinct prime divisor that has more divisors (4) than numbers in A243822(6) = 1.
