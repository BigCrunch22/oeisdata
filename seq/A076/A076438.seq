%N A076438 Numbers k which appear to have a unique representation as the difference of two perfect powers; that is, there is only one solution to Pillai's equation a^x - b^y = k, with a > 0, b > 0, x > 1, y > 1.
%C A076438 This is the classic Diophantine equation of S. S. Pillai, who conjectured that there are only a finite number of solutions for each k. A generalization of Catalan's conjecture that a^x - b^y = 1 has only one solution. See A076427 for the number of solutions for each k. Interestingly, the unique solutions (k,a,x,b,y) fall into two groups: (A076439) those in which x and y are even numbers, so that k is the difference of squares, and (A076440) those requiring an odd power. This sequence was found by examining all perfect powers (A001597) less than 2^63-1. By examining a larger set of perfect powers, we may discover that some of these numbers do not have a unique representation.
