%N A076261 Triangle T(n,k) (n >= 2, 1 <= k <= n-1) read by rows, where T(n,k) is the number of words of length n in the free group on two generators that require exactly k multiplications for their formation.
%e A076261 T(4,2)=4 because we can generate each of aaaa,abab,baba,bbbb with just two multiplications: e.g. ab=a*b, abab=ab*ab.
