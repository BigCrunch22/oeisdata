%N A076440 Numbers k which appear to have a unique representation as the difference of two perfect powers where one of those powers is odd; that is, there is only one solution to Pillai's equation a^x - b^y = k, with a > 0, b > 0, x > 1, y > 1 and that solution has odd x or odd y (or both odd).
%C A076440 There are two types of unique solutions. See A076438 for the general case. This sequence was found by examining all perfect powers (A001597) less than 2^63-1. By examining a larger set of perfect powers, we may discover that some of these numbers do not have a unique representation.
