%N A076637 Numerators of harmonic numbers when these numerators are divisible by squares of primes >= 5 in the case of Wolstenholme's Theorem.
%C A076637 By Wolstenholme's Theorem, if p prime >= 5, the numerator of the harmonic number H_{p-1} is always divisible by p^2. The obtained quotients are in A061002. - _Bernard Schott_, Dec 02 2018
%C A076637 The numbers 363, numerator of H_7 and 9227046511387, numerator of H_{29}, which have been found by Amiram Eldar and Michel Marcus, are also divisible by prime squares, respectively by 11^2 and 43^2, but not in the case of Wolstenholme's Theorem. So, a new sequence A322434 is created with all the numerators of Harmonic numbers which are divisible by any prime square >= 5. - _Bernard Schott_, Dec 08 2018

%e A076637 25 is a term because the numerator of the harmonic number H_4 = 1 + 1/2+ 1/3 + 1/4 = 25/12 is divisible by the square of 5;
%e A076637 49 is a term because the numerator of the harmonic number H_6 = 1 + 1/2+ 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 = 49/20 is divisible by the square of 7.
