%N A076661 Index of first term of the harmonic sequence having the same denominator as the partial harmonic sequence beginning with 1/n.
%C A076661 Of more interest is the index of terms after which the denominators of the harmonic sequence always match the denominators of the partial harmonic sequence. Notice that 1/4+..1/21 has denominator 15519504, but 1/1+1/2+..1/21 has denominator 5173168.
%e A076661 a(4) = firstHM[4] = 9 because 1/4+1/5+1/6+1/7+1/8+1/9 has the same denominator (2520) as 1/1+1/2+..+1/8+1/9 (and the sums to 4,5,6,7 and 8 do not).
%t A076661 harmNumber[m_, n_] := HarmonicNumber[n] - HarmonicNumber[m - 1]; denH[n_] := Denominator[HarmonicNumber[n]]; denH[m_, n_] := Denominator[harmNumber[m, n]]; firstHM[m_] := Do[If[denH[k] == denH[m, k], Return[k], ], {k, m, 10^4}]
