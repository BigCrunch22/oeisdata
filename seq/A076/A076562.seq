%N A076562 a(1)=3; a(n>1)= greatest prime divisor of a(n-1) + n.
%C A076562 Starting with 4th term the sequence coincides with sequence with a(1)=2. Also starting with 49th term both sequence coincide with the sequence with a(1)=1! Surprisingly, the sequence with a(1)=4&5 also coincide with all above sequence starting with 49th term.
