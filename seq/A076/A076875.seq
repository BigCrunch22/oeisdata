%N A076875 Meandric numbers for a curve crossing two perpendicular lines at n points.
%C A076875 a(n) = number of ways that a curve can start in the (-,-) quadrant, cross the x and y axes at exactly n points and end in any quadrant. Line is undirected.
%H A076875 Jon Wild, <a href="/A076875/a076875.gif">Illustration of a(4) = 22</a> (ignore the arrowheads)
%F A076875 For n odd a(n) = 2*A076906(n).
%e A076875 See illustration for a(4)=22: each of the 12 solutions shown crosses the x-axis first and ten of them are related by mirror symmetry to a corresponding curve that crosses the y-axis first, making the total a(4)=22.
%Y A076875 Cf. A005316, A076876, A076906, A076907 (directed case).
