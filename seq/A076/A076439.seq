%N A076439 Numbers k which appear to have a unique representation as the difference of two perfect powers where those powers are both 2; that is, there is only one solution to Pillai's equation a^x - b^y = k, with a > 0, b > 0, x > 1, y > 1 and that solution has x = y = 2.
%C A076439 There are two types of unique solutions. See A076438 for the general case. The k for which the unique solution can be written as k = a^2 - b^2 seems to have the following properties: (1) b = a-1 for odd k and b = a-2 for even k and (2) k = 4^r * p^s, where r is in {0,1}, p is an odd prime and s is in {1,2}. This sequence was found by examining all perfect powers (A001597) less than 2^63-1. By examining a larger set of perfect powers, we may discover that some of these numbers do not have a unique representation.
