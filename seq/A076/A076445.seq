%N A076445 The smaller of a pair of powerful numbers (A001694) that differ by 2.
%C A076445 Erdos conjectured that there aren't three consecutive powerful numbers and no examples are known. There are an infinite number of powerful numbers differing by 1 (cf. A060355). A requirement for three consecutive powerful numbers is a pair that differ by 2 (necessarily odd). These pairs are much more rare.
%C A076445 Sentance gives a method for constructing families of these numbers from the solutions of Pell equations x^2-my^2=1 for certain m whose square root has a particularly simple form as a continued fraction. Sentance's result can be generalized to any m such that A002350(m) is even. These m, which generate all consecutive odd powerful numbers, are in A118894. - _T. D. Noe_, May 04 2006
