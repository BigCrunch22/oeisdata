%N A076017 Number of nonisomorphic systems with n elements with one binary operation satisfying the equation B(AB)=A (semisymmetric quasigroups).
%C A076017 In January of 1968, _Don Knuth_ described the concept of what he called an "abstract grope" to the students in his class for sophomore math majors at Caltech.
%C A076017 The students had just learned about abstract groups and he wanted them to get experience doing research with other algebraic axioms; so he challenged them to prove as many interesting things as they could about sets of elements with a binary operator that satisfies the identity x(yx)=y.
%C A076017 The name came from the fact that they were groping for results. Such systems were studied in a series of papers by Sade under a more complicated and more dignified yet less memorable name, "semisymmetric quasigroups". The students came up with some good stuff, including the concept of normal subgropes.
