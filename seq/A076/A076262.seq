%N A076262 Triangle T(n,k) (n >= 2, 1 <= k <= n-1) read by rows, where T(n,k) is the number of words of length n in the free group on three generators that require exactly k multiplications for their formation.
%e A076262 T(4,2)= 9 because each of aaaa,bbbb,cccc,abab,acac,baba,bcbc,caca,cbcb can be formed in just two multiplications: e.g. ab=a*b, abab=ab*ab.
