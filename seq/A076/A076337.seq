%S A076337 509203
%N A076337 Riesel numbers: odd numbers n such that for all k >= 1 the numbers n*2^k - 1 are composite.
%C A076337 509203 has been proved to be a member of the sequence, and is conjectured to be the smallest member. However, as of 2009, there are still several smaller numbers which are candidates and have not yet been ruled out (see links).
%C A076337 Riesel numbers are proved by exhibiting a periodic sequence p of prime divisors with p(k) | n*2^k-1 and disproved by finding prime n*2^k-1. It is conjectured that numbers that cannot be proved Riesel in this way are non-Riesel. However, some numbers resist both proof and disproof.
%C A076337 Others conjecture the opposite: that there are infinitely many Riesel numbers that do not arise from a covering system, see A101036. The word "odd" is needed in the definition because otherwise for any term n, all numbers n*2^m, m >= 1, would also be Riesel numbers, but we don't want them in this sequence (as is manifest from A101036). Since 1 and 3 obviously are not in this sequence, for any n in this sequence n-1 is an even number > 2 and therefore composite, so one could replace "k >= 1" equivalently by "k >= 0". - _M. F. Hasler_, Aug 20 2020
%C A076337 Named after the Swedish mathematician Hans Ivar Riesel (1929-2014). - _Amiram Eldar_, Apr 02 2022
