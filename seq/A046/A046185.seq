%N A046185 A B2-sequence due to Rachel Lewis.
%C A046185 "The first 68 elements of the sequence are [given], then the greedy algorithm is used." For this B2-sequence: "The reciprocal sum is at least 2.16086," greater than that of the Mian-Chowla sequence (A005282), which is at most 2.158533. - _Danny Rorabaugh_ (with quotes by Rachel Lewis), Sep 29 2015
