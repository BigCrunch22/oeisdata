%N A194704 Triangle read by rows: T(k,m) = number of occurrences of k in the last section of the set of partitions of (4 + m).
%C A194704 Sub-triangle of A182703 and also of A194812. Note that the sum of every row is also the number of partitions of 4. For further information see A182703 and A135010.

%e A194704 For k = 1 and m = 1: T(1,1) = 5 because there are five parts of size 1 in the last section of the set of partitions of 5, since 4 + m = 5, so a(1) = 5.
%e A194704 For k = 2 and m = 1: T(2,1) = 1 because there is only one part of size 2 in the last section of the set of partitions of 5, since 4 + m = 5, so a(2) = 1.
