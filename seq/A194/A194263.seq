%N A194263 Numbers that occur more than once in A193873, in order of appearance.
%C A194263 Note that a(1) = 1729 is known as the Hardy-Ramanujan number (see A001235).
%C A194263 Apparently these numbers occur only twice in A193873.
%C A194263 Many of these numbers occur more than twice. For example, 812405017 occurs 3 times, a(67), a(134), and a(268). _Robert Price_, Mar 17 2020

%F A194263 It appears that a(n) = A193873(2*n+1).
%F A194263 This conjecture only holds for n<62: a(62)=A193873(124)=A193873(2n)=620378449
%F A194263 , a(63)=A193873(125)=A193873(2n-1)=424315751
%F A194263 . _Robert Price_, Mar 17 2020
%e A194263 1729 is in the sequence because the Hardy-Ramanujan number is also the smallest product of three distinct primes of the form 3*k+1 and also of the form 6*k+1, so 1729 occurs more than once in A193873.
%Y A194263 Cf. A001235, A154729, A193869, A193873.
