%N A194702 Triangle read by rows: T(k,m) = number of occurrences of k in the last section of the set of partitions of (2 + m).
%C A194702 Sub-triangle of A182703 and also of A194812. Note that the sum of every row is also the number of partitions of 2. For further information see A182703 and A135010.
%F A194702 T(k,m) = A182703(2+m,k), with T(k,m) = 0 if k > 2+m.
%F A194702 T(k,m) = A194812(2+m,k).

%e A194702 For k = 1 and  m = 1; T(1,1) = 2 because there are two parts of size 1 in the last section of the set of partitions of 3, since 2 + m = 3, so a(1) = 2. For k = 2 and m = 1; T(2,1) = 0 because there are no parts of size 2 in the last section of the set of partitions of 3, since 2 + m = 3, so a(2) = 0.
%Y A194702 Always the sum of row k = p(2) = A000041(n) = 2.
