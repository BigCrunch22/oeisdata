%N A194282 Variant of the even lucky numbers (A045954).
%C A194282 Write down even numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, ...; first term is 2 so starting from 2 remove every second number: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, 50, ...; next number is 6 so remove every 6th term starting from 2: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 50, ...; etc.
%C A194282 This differs from the even lucky numbers in that for those the first step of removals consists of removing every fourth number rather than every second number as is done here. Michon calls this starting "the sieving directly with p = 2."
