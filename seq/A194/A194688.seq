%N A194688 First differences of A036554 (numbers whose binary representation ends in an odd number of zeros).
%C A194688 Conjecture.  This sequence is self-generated according to the following rule:  start with {4} at step 0, then extend by steps, appending {2,2,4} at step n if a(n)=4 or appending {4} if a(n)=2.  (This has been verified for several thousand terms.)  To illustrate, the first few steps of this process give {4}->{4,2,2,4}, since a(1)=4,  ->{4,2,2,4,4}, since a(2)=2,  ->{4,2,2,4,4,4}, since a(3)=2,->{{4,2,2,4,4,4,2,2,4}, since a(4)=4, etc.  Equivalently, it appears that {a(n)} is the fixed-point of the morphism 2->4, 4->422, starting with 4.
%C A194688 Since A036554 = 2*A003159, this conjecture follows from the paper by Allouche, Shallit and Skordev in 2005, see page 13. - _Michel Dekking_, Jan 06 2019
%C A194688 It appears that arbitrarily long runs of terms of this sequence occur in A023630 and A023632.
