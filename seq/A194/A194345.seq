%N A194345 Numbers n for which the largest prime factor of p(n) divides p(1)*p(2)*...*p(n-1), where p(n) is the number of partitions of n.
%C A194345 It appears that for all n > 180, the largest prime factor of p(n) does not divide p(1)*p(2)*...*p(n-1). This has been checked up to n = 2000.
%C A194345 See A071963 and A194259 for links and additional comments.
%e A194345 1 is in the sequence because p(1) = 1 and 1 has no prime factor, so the condition is vacuously true.
%e A194345 For n = 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 24, 33, 38, 39, 82, 97, every prime factor of p(n) divides p(1)*p(2)*...*p(n-1).
%e A194345 For n = 158, 166, 180, not every prime factor of p(n) divides p(1)*p(2)*...*p(n-1), but the largest one does.
