%N A194469 Values of m for which sqrt(m) is curbed by 1/2; see Comments for "curbed by".
%C A194469 Suppose that r and c are real numbers, that 0<c<1, and that s(n)=sum{<c+k*r>-<k*r> : 1<=k<=n}, where < > denotes fractional part.  The inequalities s(n)<0, s(n)=0, s(n)>0 yield up to three sequences that partition the set of positive integers, as in the examples cited at A194368.  If s(n)>=0 for every n>=1, we say that r is curbed by c.  For r=sqrt(m), clearly r is curbed by 1/2 if m is a square.  Conjecture:  there are infinitely many nonsquare m for which sqrt(m) is curbed by 1/2, and there are infinitely many m for which sqrt(m) is not curbed by 1/2 (see A194470).
%C A194469 The terms shown here for A194469 are conjectured, based on examinations of s(n) for 1<=n<=B for various B>100.
