%N A194432 D-toothpick sequence starting with a cross formed by 4 toothpicks.
%C A194432 On the infinite square grid we start with no toothpicks.
%C A194432 At stage 1, we place a cross, centered at the origin, formed by 2 vertical toothpicks and 2 horizontal toothpicks of length 1. At stage 2, we place 8 D-toothpicks of length sqrt(2). At stage 3, we place 16 toothpicks of length 1. And so on.
%C A194432 The sequence gives the number of toothpicks and D-toothpicks in the structure after n-th stage. The first differences (A194433) give the number of toothpicks and D-toothpicks added at n-th stage.
%C A194432 Apparently this cellular automaton has a fractal (or fractal-like) behavior related to power of 2, similar to A194270 and very similar to A194434. The octagonal structure contains a large number of distinct polygonal shapes. For more information see A194270, A194440 and A194442.
