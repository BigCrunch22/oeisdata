%N A194186 a(n) = A193507(n) - A080359(n).
%C A194186 Conjecture: The sequence is unbounded.
%C A194186 Records are 0, 18, 36, 48, 52, ... with indices 1, 14, 20, 44, 96, ...
%C A194186 The places of nonzero terms correspond to places of those terms of A193507 which are in A164294. Conjecture: The asymptotic density of nonzero terms is 2/(e^2+1). A heuristic proof follows from the comment to A193507 and the first reference there.
