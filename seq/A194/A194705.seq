%N A194705 Triangle read by rows: T(k,m) = number of occurrences of k in the last section of the set of partitions of (5 + m).
%C A194705 Sub-triangle of A182703 and also of A194812. Note that the sum of every row is also the number of partitions of 5. For further information see A182703 and A135010.

%e A194705 For k = 1 and m = 1: T(1,1) = 7 because there are seven parts of size 1 in the last section of the set of partitions of 6, since 5 + m = 6, so a(1) = 7.
%e A194705 For k = 2 and m = 1: T(2,1) = 4 because there are four parts of size 2 in the last section of the set of partitions of 6, since 5 + m = 6, so a(2) = 4.
