%N A194706 Triangle read by rows: T(k,m) = number of occurrences of k in the last section of the set of partitions of (6 + m).
%C A194706 Sub-triangle of A182703 and also of A194812. Note that the sum of every row is also the number of partitions of 6. For further information see A182703 and A135010.

%e A194706 For k = 1 and m = 1: T(1,1) = 11 because there are 11 parts of size 1 in the last section of the set of partitions of 7, since 6 + m = 7, so a(1) = 11.
%e A194706 For k = 2 and m = 1: T(2,1) = 3 because there are three parts of size 2 in the last section of the set of partitions of 7, since 6 + m = 7, so a(2) = 3.
