%N A194428 Number of iterations of the map n->n/3 if n == 0 (mod 3), n->4*n+a if 4*n+a == 0 (mod 3) where a = 1 or 2, before reaching the end of the cycle.
%C A194428 The problem is as follows: start with any number n. If n is divisible by 3, divide it by 3, otherwise multiply it by 4 and add 1 or 2 in order to find a new integer divisible by 3. Do we always reach the end of a cycle? It is conjectured that the answer is yes.
%C A194428 On the set of positive integers, the orbit of any number seems to end in the orbit of 1, or of another integer.
%C A194428 This problem has a resemblance with the Collatz problem.
