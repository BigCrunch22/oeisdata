%N A194003 Number of prime factors of n^8 + 1, counted with multiplicity.
%C A194003 This is to A193330 as A002523(n) = n^4+1 is to A002522(n) = n^2 + 1, and as A060890(n) = n^8+1 is to A002522(n) = n^2 + 1. a(n) = 1 when n^8+1 is prime, iff n is in {1, 2, 4} unless there is a larger Fermat prime than 65537.

%e A194003 a(10) = 2 because 10^8 + 1 = 100000001 = 17 * 5882353 has 2 prime factors.
%e A194003 a(40) = 6 because 40^8 + 1 = 6553600000001 = 17^2 * 113 * 337 * 641 * 929 has 6 prime factors (with multiplicity) and is the smallest example not squarefree.
