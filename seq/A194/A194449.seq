%N A194449 Largest part minus the number of parts > 1 in the n-th region of the set of partitions of j, if 1 <= n <= A000041(j).
%C A194449 Also triangle read by rows: T(j,k) = largest part minus the numbers of parts > 1 in the k-th region of the last section of the set of partitions of j. It appears that the sum of row j is equal to A000041(j-1). For the definition of "region" of the set of partitions of j see A206437. See also A135010.

%F A194449 a(n) = A141285(n) - A194448(n).
%e A194449 The 7th region of the shell model of partitions is [5, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. The largest part is 5 and the number of parts > 1 is 2, so a(7) = 5 - 2 = 3 (see an illustration in the link section).
