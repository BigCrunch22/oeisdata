%N A194276 Number of distinct polygonal shapes after n-th stage in the D-toothpick structure of A194270.
%C A194276 The cellular automaton of A194270 contains a large number of distinct polygonal shapes. For simplicity we also call polygonal shapes "polygons".
%C A194276 In order to construct this sequence we use the following rules:
%C A194276 - Consider only the convex polygons and the concave polygons. Self-intersecting polygons are not counted. (Note that some polygons contain in their body a toothpick or D-toothpick with an exposed endpoint; that element is not a part of the perimeter of the polygon.)
%C A194276 - If two polygons have the same shape but they have different size then these polygons must be counted as distinct polygonal shapes.
%C A194276 - The reflected shapes of asymmetric polygons, both with the same area, must be counted as distinct polygonal shapes.
%C A194276 For more information see A194277 and A194278.
%C A194276 Question: Is there a maximal record in this sequence?
