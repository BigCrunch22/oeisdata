%N A366548 a(0) = 0; for n > 0, a(n) is the number of terms prior to the term a(n-1-a(n-1)) that equal a(n-1-a(n-1)).
%C A366548 In the first 10 million terms the value 4 appears the most often, 11838 times, although the count of neighboring values is less than 2% different. It is unknown if this stays the most common term as n increases. In the same range on thirty-eight occasions there are three consecutive equal terms, the first time being a(105) = a(106) = a(107) = 8. It is unknown if four or more consecutive terms eventually appear.

%e A366548 a(2) = 1 as a(2-1-a(2-1)) = a(1-0) = a(1) = 0, and there is one term prior to a(1) that equals 0, namely a(0).
%e A366548 a(6) = 1 as a(6-1-a(6-1)) = a(5-2) = a(3) = 1, and there is one term prior to a(3) that equals 1, namely a(2).
