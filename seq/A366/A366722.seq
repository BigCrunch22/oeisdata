%N A366722 Number of limit dominated binary relations on [n].
%C A366722 A relation R is limit dominated iff R converges to a single limit L (A365534) and R is contained in L.
%C A366722 A convergent relation R is limit dominated iff the following implication holds for all x,y in [n].  If (x,y) is in R then there is a cyclic traverse from x to y in G(R), where G(R) is the directed graph with loops associated to R.
