%N A366952 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not yet appeared that shares a factor with n but does not equal n, and shares a factor with a(n-1).
%C A366952 The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers, although the primes typically take many terms to appear, e.g., a(95890) = 223. When a prime does appear it is often followed by a term that is significantly larger than the average-sized term. See the examples below. The primes do not occur in their natural order.

%e A366952 a(3) = 6 as 6 does not equal 3, shares the factor 3 with 3 while sharing the factor 2 with a(2) = 4.
%e A366952 a(29) = 203 as 203 does not equal 29, shares the factor 29 with 29 while sharing the factor 7 with a(28) = 7. This is an example of both n and a(n-1) being primes which forces a(n) to be significantly larger than the average-sized term.
