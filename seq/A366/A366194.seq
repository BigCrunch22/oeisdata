%N A366194 Number of limit dominating binary relations on [n].
%C A366194 A relation R is limit dominating iff R converges to a single limit L (A365534) and R contains L.  See Gregory, Kirkland, and Pullman.
%C A366194 A convergent relation R is limit dominating iff the following implication holds for all x,y in [n].  If there is a cyclic traverse from x to y in G(R) then (x,y) is in R, where G(R) is the directed graph with loops associated to R.
