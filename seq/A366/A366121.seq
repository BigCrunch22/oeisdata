%N A366121 A fractal sequence. Pick any term t: exactly two of the t terms following t are larger than t.
%C A366121 Starting with a(1) = 2, this is the lexicographically earliest sequence with this property.
%C A366121 If we want the two terms to be distinct, see A366122.
%e A366121 Two terms out of 2 following a(1) = 2 are > 2: they are 3 and 3.
%e A366121 Two terms out of 3 following a(2) = 3 are > 3: they are 4 and 4.
%e A366121 Two terms out of 3 following a(3) = 3 are > 3: they are 4 and 4.
%e A366121 Two terms out of 4 following a(4) = 4 are > 4: they are 5 and 5.
%e A366121 Two terms out of 4 following a(5) = 4 are > 4: they are 5 and 5.
%e A366121 Two terms out of 2 following a(6) = 2 are > 2: they are 5 and 5.
%e A366121 Two terms out of 5 following a(7) = 5 are > 5: they are 6 and 6.
%e A366121 Two terms out of 5 following a(8) = 5 are > 5: they are 6 and 6; etc.
