%N A366483 Place n equally spaced points on each side of an equilateral triangle, and join each of these points by a chord to the 2*n new points on the other two sides:  sequence gives number of vertices in the resulting planar graph.
%C A366483 We start with the three corner points of the triangle, and add n further points along each edge. Including the corner points, we end up with n+2 points along each edge, and the edge is divided into n+1 line segments.
%C A366483 Each of the n points added to an edge is joined by 2*n chords to the points that were added to the other two edges. There are 3*n^2 chords.

%Y A366483 Cf. A3366484 (interior vertices), A366485 (edges), A2366486 (regions).
%Y A366483 If the 3*n points are placed "in general position" instead of uniformly, we get sequences A366478, A365929, A366932, A367015.
%Y A366483 If the 3*n points are placed uniformly and we also draw chords from the three corner points of the triangle to these 3*n points, we get A274585, A092866, A274586, A092867.
