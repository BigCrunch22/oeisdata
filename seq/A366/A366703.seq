%N A366703 List of quadruples (a,b,c,d) with a^4 + b^4 = c^4 + d^4, a < c < d < b, a,b,c,d prime, listed in order of the largest term b.
%C A366703 See A255352 for quadruples which do not necessarily consist of prime numbers. There are infinitely many such quadruples, because if (a, b, c, d) is in the sequence, so is (m*a, m*b, m*c, m*d). It is unknown whether there are infinitely many quadruples which consist only of prime numbers. The two given quadruples are the only ones with a^4 + b^4 = c^4 + d^4 <= 10^24.
