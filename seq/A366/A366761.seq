%N A366761 Numbers that have at least one exponent in their canonical prime factorization that is divisible by 3.
%C A366761 Each term has a unique representation of as product of two numbers: one is a cube (A000578) and the second is a number that is not in this sequence.
%C A366761 The asymptotic density of this sequence is 1 - zeta(3) * Product_{p prime} (1 - 2/p^3 + 1/p^4) = 0.10483363599014046584... .
%C A366761 From _Amiram Eldar_, Jan 22 2024: (Start)
%C A366761 The complement of this sequence is the sequence of numbers called "unitarily 3-free", or "3-skew", by Cohen (1961).
%C A366761 He proved that the asymptotic density of unitarily k-free, i.e., numbers whose prime factorization contain no exponent that is divisible by k, is zeta(k) * Product_{p prime} (1 - 2/p^k + 1/p^(k+1)) (see p. 228, eq. 3.18). (End)
