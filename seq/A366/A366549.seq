%N A366549 a(0) = 0; for n > 0, a(n) is the number of terms prior to and including the term a(n-1-a(n-1)) that equal a(n-1-a(n-1)).
%C A366549 In the first 10 million terms the value 1 appears the most often, 13584 times, although the count of neighboring values is less than 2% different. It is unknown if this stays the most common term as n increases. In the same range on fifty occasions there are three consecutive equal terms, the second time, after the three 1's at the start of the sequence, being a(406) = a(407) = a(408) = 11. It is unknown if four or more consecutive terms eventually appear.

%e A366549 a(2) = 1 as a(2-1-a(2-1)) = a(1-1) = a(0) = 0, and there is one term prior to or equal to a(0) that equals 0, namely a(0).
%e A366549 a(6) = 3 as a(6-1-a(6-1)) = a(5-2) = a(3) = 1, and there are three terms prior to or equal to a(3) that equal 1, namely a(1), a(2) and a(3).
