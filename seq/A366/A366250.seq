%N A366250 Numbers k that are not powerful and do not have a strictly superior squarefree divisor.
%C A366250 A number k does not have a strictly superior squarefree divisor if and only if k is at least as large as the square of rad(k), the largest squarefree divisor of k. All powerful numbers (A001694) have this property. This sequence lists the other such numbers.
%C A366250 Let rad(k) = A007947(k), the largest squarefree divisor, i.e., the squarefree kernel of k. A341645 lists the numbers without a strictly superior squarefree divisor.
%C A366250 A341645 = { k : rad(k) <= k/rad(k) } = { k : A007947(k) <= A003557(k) }, and it is evident that rad(k) <= k/rad(k) is true for powerful k, that is, k in A001694.
%C A366250 Since A001694 contains A001597, the above is also true for perfect powers k; A001597 is a proper subset of A341645.
%C A366250 This sequence contains "weak" k (in A052485) such that rad(k) < k/rad(k).
%C A366250 The presence of a number, k, in this sequence depends only upon A290110(k), i.e., upon the factorization pattern of its sequence of divisors as defined in A191743.
%C A366250 Let S = A006939 and let P = A002110. Almost all superprimorials are in this sequence: S \ {1, 2, 12, 360} is a proper subset. S(i) = S(i-1)*P(i), where S(i-1) = A003557(S(i)) and P(i) = rad(S(i)), and for i > 4, S(i-1) > P(i). Since prime(i) | S(i) but prime(i)^2 does not divide S(i), S(i) is not powerful. Corollary: almost all superprimorials are in A341645, since this sequence is a proper subset of A341645.

%F A366250 Set difference of A341645 and A001694.
%F A366250 Intersection of A341645 and A364702 where the latter is a proper subset of A052485.
%F A366250 Sequence contains infinite intersections of A052485 and { k = m*s : s is squarefree, rad(m) | s, 1 < s < m }.
%F A366250 {a(n)} = union of { k = s*m : s > 1 is squarefree, rad(m) | s, m >= s, k is not powerful }.
%F A366250 {a(n)} = { k in A364702 : k >= rad(k)^2 }.
%e A366250 Let b(n) = A364702(n).
%e A366250 a(1) = b(1) = 48 since rad(48) < 48/rad(48), 6 < 8.
%e A366250 b(2) = 50 is not in the sequence since rad(50) > 50/rad(50), 10 > 5.
%e A366250 a(2) = b(3) = 54 since 6 < 9, etc.
