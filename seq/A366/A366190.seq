%N A366190 Minimal lengths of prime knots formed by orthogonal unit line segments of the cubic lattice.
%C A366190 The same term may correspond to more than one knot. For the initial terms, the minimum lengths were found within three layers of the lattice and it is conceivable that the tightest representation of larger knots expand in all three axes.

%e A366190 a(1) = 4 because the unknot is represented by four joined unit line segments, forming a closed loop, in the lattice.
%e A366190 a(2) = 24 because the second simplest knot, the trefoil knot, 3_1, can be described by 24 joined unit line segments, forming a self-avoiding closed loop in the lattice.
