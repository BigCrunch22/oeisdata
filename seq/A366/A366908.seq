%N A366908 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive integers such that, for n > 1, a(n) shares a factor with n but does not equal n, while not sharing a factor with a(n-1).
%C A366908 To ensure the sequence is infinite a(n) must be chosen so that it does not have as prime factors all the distinct prime factors of n+1. The first time this rule is required is when determining a(15); see the examples below.
%C A366908 For the terms studied the primes appear in their natural order except for 11 and 13 which are reversed. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A366908 a(4) = 2 as 2 does not equal 4, shares the factor 2 with 4 while not sharing a factor with a(3) = 9.
%e A366908 a(15) = 25 as 25 does not equal 15, shares the factor 5 with 15 while not sharing a factor with a(14) = 7. Note that 6 is unused and satisfies these requirements but as 15 + 1 = 16 = 2^4 only contains 2 as a distinct prime factor, a(15) cannot also contain 2 as a factor else a(16) would not exist.
