%N A366360 Irregular triangle read by rows where each row is coin denominations which make amounts 1 to 99 using the smallest total number of coins by the greedy algorithm.
%C A366360 The greedy algorithm makes a given amount by as many as possible of the largest coin, then as many as possible of the second largest towards the remainder, and so on.
%C A366360 A row of length d makes amounts 1 to 99 using total A339334(99,d) coins which is the minimum possible for d denominations by the greedy algorithm.
%C A366360 Denominations within a row are in ascending order and rows are ordered by length and then lexicographically.
%C A366360 Each row starts with denomination 1 since 1 is the only way to make amount 1.
%C A366360 This is a finite sequence, ending with a row of all denominations 1 to 99 which makes every amount with a single coin each.
%C A366360 Amounts 1 to 99 are based on making change in a decimal currency with coins for 1 to 99 cents, and with the greedy algorithm being an easy way to make amounts by successively taking the largest possible coin.
%C A366360 Minimizing the total coins minimizes the average number of coins given as change assuming each of 1 to 99 are equally likely.
