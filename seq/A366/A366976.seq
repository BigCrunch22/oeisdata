%N A366976 Numbers that cannot be written as sum of two or more consecutive nonprimes.
%C A366976 The complement sequence of sums of two or more consecutive nonprime numbers.
%e A366976 9 is a term because trying the sums of candidate consecutive nonprimes 1 + 4 = 5 != 9, 1 + 4 + 6 = 11 != 9, 4 + 6 = 10 != 9. All these sums miss the integer 9.
%e A366976 On the other hand, 23 is not a term because 23 = 6 + 8 + 9, which is the sum of three consecutive nonprime numbers.
%Y A366976 Cf. A051349, A018252, A367021.
%Y A366976 Primes in the sequence: A257393.
