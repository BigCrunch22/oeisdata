%N A366691 Lexicographically earliest sequence such that each set of terms enclosed by two equal values, excluding the endpoints, contains a distinct number of elements.
%C A366691 The word 'set' means that every element is unique. For example, the set {1,1,2} contains 2 elements (not 3).
%C A366691 Two consecutive values enclose 0 terms, and thus after {a(1), a(2)} = {1, 1}, no consecutive equal values occur again.
%e A366691 a(1)=1; no pair of terms exists yet.
%e A366691 a(2)=1 creates the pair {1, 1}, which encloses 0 elements. This means that no consecutive equal values can occur again, since this would create another set of 0 elements.
%e A366691 a(3)=2 because if a(3)=1, this would create a second pair enclosing 0 elements.
%e A366691 a(4)=1 creates two new sets {1, 2, 1}, enclosing 1 element {2}, and {1, 1, 2, 1}, enclosing 2 elements {1, 2}.
%e A366691 a(5) cannot be 1 as this would again create a pair enclosing 0 elements {1,1}. 2 would create the set {2, 1, 2} which encloses 1 element {1}, which has been impossible since a(4). So a(5)=3, which has not occurred before.
%e A366691 Skip ahead to a(11)=7. Any smaller term would enclose a set of 0,2,3,4, or 5 terms, which is impossible since sets with this many distinct elements have already occurred. For example, the set of 5 distinct terms appeared as {1,2,1,3,4,2,5,1} = {2,1,3,4,5}.
%Y A366691 Cf. A337226 (with nondistinct terms counted), A330896, A363757.
