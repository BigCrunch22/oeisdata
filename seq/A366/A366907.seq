%N A366907 a(n) is the number of geometric progressions with three or more terms, with rational ratio > 0, formed by the terms a(n-1), a(n-1-k), a(n-1-2*k),...,a(n-1-t*k) where k>=1, t>=2, and n-1-t*k>=0.
%C A366907 The sequence is dominated by the count of progressions consisting of three or more 0's. Very rarely the count of these zero-progressions forms a new progression of its own, which forms a short series of small terms and resets the subsequent count of the zero-progressions to a lower value. In the first 10^5 terms this only happens three times - at a(10) (which is not readily noticeable on the graph of the terms), a(644), and a(61434). See the attached images.
