%N A366566 a(n) is the expected end time of a game with three gamblers, one of which starts with capital n, the others with capital 1 each. The end time, rounded to the nearest integer, is given for games in which one of the two poor players wins.
%C A366566 For details see the Diaconis link.
%C A366566 The terms were calculated using Monte Carlo simulation of 10^9 games at each value of n.
%C A366566 The expected end times without rounding to nearest integer are: 3.00, 5.57, 8.76, 12.57, 17.03, 22.14, 27.91, 34.33, 41.41, 49.15, 57.55, 66.61, 76.33, 86.72, ... .
%C A366566 The expected shorter end time also allowing the rich player to win would be 2*n+1 (Bachelier, 1912, page 149).
