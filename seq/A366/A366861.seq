%N A366861 Largest elements of triples (a, b, c) with a > b > c = 1 such that ab+c, ac+b and bc+a are perfect squares.
%C A366861 Equivalently, numbers a such that there exists 1 < b < a such that ab+1 and a+b are prefect squares.
%C A366861 When a = b+2, then ab+1 = (b+1)^2, so there remains only the condition that a+b = 2b+2 = (2m)^2 for some integer m >= 2 (since the square must be even and b > c = 1, so m > 1). Thus, all a = 2*m^2 + 1 with m >= 2, A058331(2..) = 9, 19, 33, ..., are in this sequence.

%e A366861 a(1) = 9 is in the sequence because for b = 7, we have that ab+1 = 8^2 and a+b = 4^2 both are squares (whence ab+c, ac+b and bc+a are squares for c = 1).
%e A366861 a(2) = 12 is in the sequence because for b = 4, we have ab+1 = 7^2 and a+b = 4^2 both squares.
