%N A366242 Numbers that are products of "Fermi-Dirac primes" (A050376) that are powers of primes with exponents that are powers of 4.
%C A366242 A subsequence of A252895, and first differs from it at n = 172. A252895(172) = 256 = 2^(2^3) is not a term of this sequence.
%C A366242 Equivalently, numbers that are products of "Fermi-Dirac primes" that are powers of primes with exponents that are powers of 2 with even exponents.
%C A366242 Products of distinct numbers of the form p^(2^(2*k)), where p is prime and k >= 0.
%C A366242 Numbers whose prime factorization has exponents that are positive terms of the Moser-de Bruijn sequence (A000695).
%C A366242 Every integer k has a unique representation as a product of 2 numbers: one is in this sequence and the other is in A366243: k = A366244(k) * A366245(k).
%C A366242 The asymptotic density of this sequence is 1/c = 0.65531174251481086750..., where c is given in the formula section.
