%N A366982 a(n) is the smallest odd k > 1 such that n^((k+1)/2) == n (mod k).
%C A366982 If this sequence is bounded, then it is periodic with period P = LCM(A), where A is the set of all (pairwise distinct) terms.
%C A366982 Note that n^((1729+1)/2) == n (mod 1729) for every n >= 0, where 1729 is the smallest absolute Euler pseudoprime (A033181).
%C A366982 Thus a(n) <= 1729. So, as said, this sequence is periodic.
%C A366982 What is its period?
%C A366982 If the largest term of this sequence is indeed 1729, it should be expected that its period P may be longer than the period of Euler primary pretenders (A309316), namely P > 41#*571#/4 (248 digits).
