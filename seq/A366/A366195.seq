%N A366195 Integers whose binary expansion has the property that there exists a length-k substring of bits in the expansion that is strictly lexicographically later than the first k bits.
%C A366195 These are numbers whose binary expansion corresponds to an invalid prefix of a Lyndon word on a two-letter alphabet. If the alphabet is {x, y}, where x < y, then taking the binary expansion of a(n) and mapping 1 to x and 0 to y results in a string that is not a prefix to any Lyndon word. Moreover, this sequence enumerates all strings starting with x that are not prefixes of Lyndon words on this alphabet.
%C A366195 A328870 is a subsequence of this sequence.
%C A366195 For k>=4, the number of k-bit terms in this sequence is 1,3,10,24,58,130,287,613,1302,2720,5655,11665,23969,...

%e A366195 The binary expansion of a(3) = 22 is 10110, which has a length-2 substring ("11") which is strictly lexicographically later than the first 2 bits ("10"). This also means that xyxxy is not a prefix of any Lyndon word over the alphabet {x,y}.
