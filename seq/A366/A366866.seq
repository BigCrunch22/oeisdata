%N A366866 Number of binary relations R on [n] such that the transitive closure of R contains the identity relation.
%C A366866 Equivalently, a(n) is the number of n X n Boolean relation matrices whose Frobenius normal form contains no 0-blocks on the diagonal.  See Gregory, Kirkland, and Pullman.
%C A366866 Equivalently, a(n) is the number of labeled directed graphs on [n] (with self loops allowed) such that every strongly connected component contains at least one arc.
%C A366866 This sequence is a good upper-bound for the number of relations that converge to a quasi-order (A366252) which is only known for n <= 6.
%C A366866 If the transitive closure of a relation R contains the identity relation then there is exactly one transitive relation in {R,R^2,R^3...}.  See Schwarz link.
