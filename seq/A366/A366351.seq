%N A366351 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not yet appeared whose binary string value contains at least one binary prime factor of a(n-1).
%C A366351 This is the base-2 equivalent of A365703. Unlike that sequence is it conjectured all numbers appear. The only fixed point in the first 10000 terms is 6, and it is likely no more exist.

%e A366351 a(6) = 6 = 110_2 as a(5) = 10 = 2*5 = 10_2*101_2, and 6 = "110" is the smallest unused positive number to contain at least one of "10" and "101".
