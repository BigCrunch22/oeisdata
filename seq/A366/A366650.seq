%N A366650 Number of Calabi-Yau threefolds that are a complete intersection (CICY) in products of n projective spaces.
%C A366650 A CICY is a Calabi-Yau threefold that is a complete intersection in products of projective spaces.
%C A366650 There are a(1) + a(2) + ... + a(12) = 7890 CICYs in total.
%C A366650 a(1) = 5 corresponds to the five terms in A331445.

%e A366650 There are 5 CICYs in projective space: one with a single polynomial (degree 5, the quintic), two with two polynomials (degrees 2,4 and 3,3), one with three polynomials (degrees 2,2,3), and one with four polynomials (degrees 2,2,2,2), hence a(1) = 5.
%e A366650 There are 44 CICYs in the direct product of two projective spaces, hence a(2) = 44.
