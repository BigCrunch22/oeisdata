%N A366105 a(n) is the number of parts in the n-th partition of n when the partitions are listed in graded reverse lexicographic order (cf. A080577, as in Mathematica).
%C A366105 Conjecture 1. Every integer m > 1 occurs infinitely many times. (For example, 2 occurs for n = 2,8,13,20,31,46,68,....)
%C A366105 Conjecture 2. Let f(n) be the greatest (i.e., the first) part in the n-th partition of n. Then for every integer m, there exists an index i such that f(i+1), f(i+2), ..., f(i+m) are consecutive integers.
%e A366105 The partitions of 5, listed in reverse-lexicographic order, are (5, 41, 32, 311, 221, 2111, 11111); the 5th in this list is 221, with length 3, so that a(5) = 3.
