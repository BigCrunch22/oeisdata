%N A366185 Decimal expansion of the real root of the quintic equation x^5 + 3*x^4 + 4*x^3 + x -1 = 0.
%C A366185 The root appears in the problem of minimizing the area of self-intersection of a folded rectangle. A rectangle with sides a, b (a<b) is folded along the line that passes through the center of the rectangle in order to get the minimum area of crossing intersections: a unique rectangle exists for two solutions with equal area but different shapes - triangle and pentagon.
%C A366185 The unique ratio of sides a/b=T=0.81502370129163... is derived based on the real root of the quintic. If a/b<T ('long' rectangle) the angle to fold is Pi/4. If a/b=1 (square) the angle is Pi/8.
