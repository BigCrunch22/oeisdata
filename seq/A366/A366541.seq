%N A366541 Regular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of k-facets of the bipyramid on an n-simplex base.
%C A366541 The bipyramid on an n-simplex base is the direct sum of an n-simplex and a segment. It can also be seen as two (n+1)-simplices augmented together at their base.
%C A366541 Note that all facets are simplices.
%C A366541 A deltatope is a polytope whose all cells are regular simplices (a priori not necessarily having the same size). Every polygon, being regular or not, is a 2-deltatope by definition. There are 8 convex 3-deltatopes or deltahedra (regular tetrahedron, regular octahedron, regular icosahedron, regular triangular bipyramid, regular pentagonal bipyramid and three others), 5 convex 4-deltatopes (regular 5-cell, regular 16-cell, regular 600-cell, regular tetrahedral bipyramid and regular icosahedral bipyramid) and 3 in dimension d >= 5 (regular d-simplex, regular d-orthoplex and regular bipyramid on a (d-1)-simplex base). Note that the regular orthoplex is the regular bipyramid on a hypercube base. It turns out that all cells of a deltatope are congruent (i.e., having the same size) in all nontrivial dimensions (dimension >= 3). See Dr. Richard Klitzing's answer to the Math Overflow question "4-polytopes with only one kind of regular facet" for dimension 4, and Gjergji Zaimi's answer to the question "Convex deltahedra in higher dimensions" for dimension >= 5.
%C A366541 More generally, a convex polytope whose all cells are regular polytopes of the same kind is either regular or a deltatope. See the article of Roswitha Blind.
%C A366541 The symmetry group of the bipyramid on an n-simplex base, generated by the symmetries of the n-simplex and the vertical reflexion that commute, is S_{n+1} X C_2 (with Coxeter notation [2,3^(n-1)]). See the Math Stack Exchange link.
