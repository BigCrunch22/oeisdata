%N A366701 a(n) is the nearest integer to n*log_2(3/2).
%C A366701 For n > 0, a(n) is the number of steps of a perfect fifth in n-edo (equal divison of octaves).
%C A366701 In n-edo, a chromatic semitone is 7*a(n)-4*n steps wide, and a diatonic semitone is 3*n-5*a(n) steps wide.
%C A366701 Tall Kite calls n-edo
%C A366701  - superflat if a(n)/n < 4/7, which occurs at n = 2, 4, 9, 11, 16, 23. In these tuning systems a chromatic semitone has negative width, so the sharp sign lowers the pitch and the flat sign raises it, and major intervals are narrower than minor intervals.
%C A366701  - perfect if a(n)/n = 4/7, which occurs at n = 7, 14, 21, 28, 35. In these tuning systems a chromatic semitone has zero width, so there are no sharps or flats, and there is no difference between major and minor keys.
%C A366701  - diatonic if 4/7 < a(n)/n < 3/5, which occurs at n = 12, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36 or more. In these tuning systems both the width of a chromatic semitone and the width of a diatonic semitone is positive.
%C A366701  - pentatonic if a(n)/n = 3/5, which occurs at n = 5, 10, 15, 25, 25, 30. In these tuning systems a diatonic semitone has zero width, so we have B being enharmonic to the adjacent C and F being enharmonic to the adjacent E.
%C A366701  - supersharp if a(n)/n > 3/5, which occurs at n = 1, 3, 6, 8, 13, 18. In these tuning systems a diatonic semitone has negative width, so we have B higher the adjacent C and F lower than the adjacent E.

%e A366701 a(12) = 7 since 12*log_2(3/2) = 7.01955... This corresponds to that a perfect fifth is 7 steps wide in 12-edo.
%e A366701 a(19) = 11 since 19*log_2(3/2) = 11.11428... This corresponds to that a perfect fifth is 11 steps wide in 19-edo.
