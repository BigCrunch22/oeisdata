%N A366013 Irregular triangle read by rows where each row lists coin denominations which make amounts 1 to 99 using the smallest total number of coins.
%C A366013 A row of length d makes amounts 1 to 99 using a total of A339333(99,d) coins, which is the minimum possible for d denominations.
%C A366013 Denominations within a row are in ascending order and rows are ordered by length and then lexicographically.
%C A366013 Each row starts with denomination 1 since 1 is the only way to make amount 1.
%C A366013 This is a finite sequence, ending with a row of all denominations 1 to 99 which make all amounts using a single coin each.
%C A366013 Amounts 1 to 99 are based on making change in a decimal currency which uses coins for 1 to 99 cents, and notes for whole dollar parts.
%C A366013 Minimizing the total number of coins minimizes the average number of coins given as change, assuming each of 1 to 99 are equally likely amounts to be given.
