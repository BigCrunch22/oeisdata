%N A366170 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers such that for n>1, Sum_{i=1..n, a(i)<=n} a(a(i)) is prime.
%C A366170 At a new term k, a(n) = k adds a(k) to the current prime sum if k <= n. If n is a term in the sequence among a(1..n-1), then a(n) = k is added. If neither of these conditions is met, the current prime sum remains the same.
%C A366170 If k is even and a(k) odd, then k cannot appear as a(n) = k at any n >= k (otherwise, the intended prime sum will be even, and thus not prime). This means that some even numbers will miss their chance and never appear. 38 is the smallest missing number.
%C A366170 Can it be proved that every odd number appears?

%e A366170 At [1,2], the terms at indices i=1 and i=2, namely 1 and 2, sum to 3, a prime.
%e A366170 At [1,2,4], i=4 is not the index of a term in the sequence yet, so the sum remains the same.
%e A366170 At [1,2,4,8], the sum of the terms at i=1,2,4 is a(1)=1 + a(2)=2 + a(4)=8, which is 11, a prime number.
