%N A366066 a(n) is the largest positive integer k such that n can be expressed as the sum of k distinct positive integers that are coprime to each other.
%C A366066 The indices at which k first appears, for k >= 0: 1, 3, 6, 11, 18, 29, 42, 59, 78 (A014284). Such n's are expressed as the sum of 1 and the first primes.
%C A366066 Runs with length >= 2 start at numbers k^2 - 1 (k >= 2).
%C A366066 If there are terms between runs of k and k+1, these two numbers occur alternately. Suppose that m is such a term that is b(m) terms after the first occurrence of k+1; if b(m) is odd, there are at least two even numbers in the expression of n as the sum of k+1 integers, which are not coprime to each other, so a(m) = k.
