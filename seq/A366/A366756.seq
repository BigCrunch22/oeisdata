%N A366756 Number of minimally 1-tough unlabeled graphs on n nodes.
%C A366756 A graph is minimally 1-tough if it is 1-tough but the removal of any of its edges makes it non-1-tough.

%e A366756 For n >= 3, the cycle graph is minimally 1-tough. For 3 <= n <= 6, this is the only minimally 1-tough graph, so a(n) = 1.
%e A366756 For n = 7 and n = 8, the graphs with House of Graphs id's 536 and 36063, respectively, are also minimally 1-tough, and a(7) = a(8) = 2.
%e A366756 For n = 9, the a(9) = 5 minimally 1-tough graphs are (in graph6 format) "H?CidB?" (9-cycle), "H?Cicr_", "H?Ci[b_", "H?Ci[^o", and "H?KqKVO".
