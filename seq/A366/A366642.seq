%N A366642 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct primes such that the sequence of ratios (number of divisors of n that are coprime to these primes)/(number of divisors of n) has an asymptotic mean 1/2.
%C A366642 The sequence of the number of divisors of n that are coprime to these primes is A366643.
%C A366642 Equivalently, a(n) is the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct primes such that Product_{n>=1} (a(n)-1) * log(a(n)/(a(n)-1)) = 1/2.
%C A366642 The next term has 99 digits and is too large to be included in the data section.

%e A366642 The asymptotic mean of (number of divisors of n that are coprime to 2)/A000005(n) = A001227(n)/A000005(n) is log(2) = 0.693... > 1/2. Therefore a(1) = 2.
%e A366642 The asymptotic mean of (number of divisors of n that are coprime to 2 and 3)/A000005(n) = A035218(n)/A000005(n) is 2*log(3/2)*log(2) = 0.562... > 1/2. Therefore a(2) = 3.
%e A366642 The asymptotic mean of (number of divisors of n that are coprime to 2, 3 and 5)/A000005(n) is 8*log(5/4)*log(3/2)*log(2) = 0.501... > 1/2. Therefore a(3) = 5.
%e A366642 The asymptotic mean of (number of divisors of n that are coprime to 2, 3, 5 and 7)/A000005(n) is 48*log(7/6)*log(5/4)*log(3/2)*log(2) = 0.464... < 1/2. Therefore a(4) is not 7.
%e A366642 The asymptotic mean of (number of divisors of n that are coprime to 2, 3, 5 and 149)/A000005(n) is 1184*log(149/148)*log(5/4)*log(3/2)*log(2) = 0.50002... > 1/2, and 149 is the least prime with this property. Therefore a(4) = 149.
