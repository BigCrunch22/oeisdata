%e A366493 a(2)=1 because the subsequence (1,1) has not occurred before.
%e A366493 a(8)=3 because every smaller number would form a subsequence that has occurred already. a(8) cannot be 1 because this would make the subsequence (1,1), which was seen before at i=1,2. a(8) cannot be 2 because then we would have the subsequence (2,1,2) for a second time (first at i=3-5): 1,1,2,1,2,2,1,2
