%N A366526 Prime powers (A246655) q such that 2 is a nonzero square in the finite field F_q.
%C A366526 Prime powers q that are congruent to 1 or 7 modulo 8.
%C A366526 Odd prime powers q such that 2^((q-1)/2) = 1 in F_q.
%C A366526 Prime powers q such that x^2 - 2 splits into different linear factors in F_q[x].
%C A366526 Contains the powers of primes congruent to 1 or 7 modulo 8 and the even powers of primes congruent to 3 or 5 modulo 8.
%C A366526 Proposition 1: Suppose that q is not a power of 2, gcd(a,q) = 1, then a is a square in F_q if and only if the Jacobi symbol Jacobi(a,q) = 1.
%C A366526 Proof: a is a square if and only if a^((q-1)/2) == 1 (mod p). We have a^((q-1)/2) = (a^((p-1)/2))^((q-1)/(p-1)) == Jacobi(a,p)^((q-1)/(p-1)) (mod p). Write q = p^e, then by definition, we have Jacobi(a,q) = Jacobi(a,p)^e, so it remains to prove that (q-1)/(p-1) - e = Sum^{e-1}_{i=0} (p^i - 1) is always even, which is obvious.
%C A366526 A trivial corollary would be that if q is a square, then every integer a coprime to q is always a square in F_q (since Jacobi(a,q) = 1 in this case). Indeed, since F_q is the unique quadratic extension of F_{sqrt(q)}, every quadratic polynomial with coefficients in F_{sqrt(q)} splits in F_q.
%C A366526 Proposition 2: Suppose that a == 1 (mod 4), gcd(a,q) = 1, then x^2 - x - (a-1)/4 splits into different linear factors in F_q[x] if and only if Jacobi(q,a) = 1 (or Kronecker(a,q) = 1).
%C A366526 Proof: Proposition 1 deals with the case where q is odd. For even q, we have x^2 - x - (a-1)/4 = x^2 + x + 1, which is reducible over F_q[x] if and only if q is an even power of 2.
