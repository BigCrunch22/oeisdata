%N A366574 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the maximum positive k such that all terms a(t), a(t-m), a(t-2*m), ..., a(t-(k-1)*m), for 0<t<n and any m>=1, are equal.
%C A366574 The terms form quickly form a repetitive pattern of arithmetic progressions of increasing length, see the graph. This leads to any given value t eventually being in a progression of length t+1 which then never increases.
%C A366574 See A366724 for the index where a number first appears.
