%N A366631 Lexicographically earliest sequence such that each set of numbers enclosed by a pair of equal terms, excluding the endpoints, is distinct.
%C A366631 The word 'set' means that every element is unique and order is irrelevant. {2,3}, for example, is equivalent to {3,2,2} and thus both could never appear in the sequence.
%C A366631 Two consecutive equal values enclose the empty set {}, and thus after [a(1), a(2)] = [1, 1] no consecutive equal values will occur again.
%C A366631 Note that we are considering sets between every pair of equal values, not just those that appear consecutively. For example, [2,1,2,3,2] = {1,2,3} is a pair as well as [2,3,2] = {3}.
%C A366631 Every number appears finitely many times (see the linear recurrence in formulas section). A value is banned when adding that value would make a previous set a subset of a newly formed set. For example, the value 1 cannot occur from a(5) onward because this would enclose the same set of numbers paired with a(2) as with a(1), since pairing with a(1) would only add the value a(2)=1, which already belongs to the set in the form of a(4)=1.
%C A366631 The number 526 occurs a record number of 44 times in the sequence and it does not occur again after the linear recurrence begins. The same is true of three other values which occur 41, 42, and 43 times in the sequence.
%C A366631 For n>2, a new value is always followed by the smallest number that has not yet been banned and is distinct from the previous number (i.e. does not form a null set).

%e A366631 a(2)=1, establishing the empty set [1,1] = {}.
%e A366631 a(4)=1, creating the sets [1,2,1] = {2} and [1,1,2,1] = {1,2}, which are distinct from any set that has appeared thus far. Note that 1 is now permanently banned since the next 1 would have to enclose the same set with a(1) as it would with a(2) (and thus 1 is now impossible).
%e A366631 a(8)=4: a(8) cannot be 1 since 1 has been banned. 2 would form the empty set with a(7)=2. a(8) cannot be 3 since this would form the set[3,2,3] = {2}, which already occurred as [1,2,1] = {2}. a(8)=4 because 4 is a first occurrence and thus creates no new sets (or old sets).
%e A366631 For another example of a banned number, see the last occurrence of 2, which is a(9)=2. a(10) cannot be 2 since this would form the empty set. a(11) cannot be 2 since this would form the set [2,3,2] = {3}, which occurred earlier at a(5-7). At a(12), the value 2 is finally banned forever since any 2 would form the same set of numbers with a(7)=2 as with a(5)=2. This is because a set paired with a(5)=2 would only add the value 3, which keeps the set the same as pairing with a(7)=2, which already encloses a 3 at a(10)=3.
