%N A366625 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers such that each multiset enclosed by two equal terms, excluding the endpoints, is distinct.
%C A366625 Every positive integer occurs infinitely many times in the sequence.
%C A366625 The multiset between any two equal terms is unique. For example: once consecutive values "A B C A" occur, both "D B C D" and "D C B D" can never occur, because the multiset "B C" would be repeated between equal terms.
%C A366625 Two consecutive values enclose the empty multiset. For this reason, after [a(1), a(2)] = [1, 1], no consecutive equal values will occur again.
%C A366625 A new value is always followed by 1.
%C A366625 The sequence first differs from A366624 at a(15).

%e A366625 a(15) = 5: a(15) cannot be 1 since this would form the empty multiset with a(14) = 1. a(15) cannot be 2 because this would form the multiset [2 1 2] = {1}, which already occurred at [2 1 2] = {1}. a(15) cannot be 3 because this would form the multiset [3 2 1 3] = {1, 2}, which already occurred at [1 1 2 1] = {1, 2}. a(15) cannot be 4 because this would form the multiset [4 1 2 3 2 1 4] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3}, which already occurred at [1 1 2 1 2 3 1] = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3}. a(15) = 5 because 5 is a first occurrence and thus creates no new multisets.
%e A366625 For this sequence, the multisets between k and all other occurrences of k must be checked. The first instance such that this is the sole reason for restricting a possible value is when considering 2 for a(27).
%e A366625 a(27) != 2 since 2 there would cause two enclosed multisets with the same 5 terms (in different order, which doesn't matter for a multiset),

%e A366625 There are also instances where overlapping conflicting regions are the sole reason for restricting a possible value.
%e A366625 a(74) != 5 since 5 there would cause two enclosed multisets with the same 20 terms,
