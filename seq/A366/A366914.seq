%N A366914 Numbers expressible as the sum of their distinct prime factors raised to a natural exponent.
%C A366914 Each prime factor must appear exactly once in the sum.
%e A366914 30 is a term because its distinct prime factors are 2, 3 and 5, and 30 = 2^1 + 3^1 + 5^2 = 2^4 + 3^2 + 5^1.
%e A366914 42 is a term because its distinct prime factors are 2, 3 and 7, and 42 = 2^3 + 3^3 + 7^1 = 2^5 + 3^1 + 7^1.
