%N A366755 Number of 1-tough unlabeled graphs on n vertices.
%H A366755 Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_toughness">Graph toughness</a>.
%F A366755 a(n) <= A002218(n) for n >= 2 because all 1-tough graphs (except the 1-node graph) are 2-connected.
%e A366755 For n = 5, all but two of the A002218(5) = 10 2-connected graphs are 1-tough, so a(5) = 8. The exceptions are the complete bipartite graph K_{2,3} and the complete tripartite graph K_{1,1,3}. To see that these graphs are not 1-tough, note that, in both cases, two vertices can be removed resulting in a graph with three components (isolated vertices).
