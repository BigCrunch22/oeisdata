%N A366476 Number of possible chmess games at the end of the n-th ply.
%C A366476 Chmess is an imaginary game very similar to chess, with the exception that the king can move two squares in any direction instead of just one. To get a(1) = 25 I am assuming the king can jump over an occupied square, but is not allowed to move out and back (which would give a(1) = 26).
