%N A366462 a(n) is the length of the longest word w in the Period-doubling sequence (A096268) in which every length-n factor of w is unique.
%C A366462 So far, all the values in the list except the first two are odd numbers.
%e A366462 For n=3, the length of the longest word in the Period-doubling sequence that admits only unique length-3 factors is a(3) = 7 (attained by word 1000101 and its reversal).
