%N A366218 Number of convergent binary relations on [n] (A365534) that converge to an equivalence relation (A000110).
%C A366218 Equivalently, a(n) is the number of Boolean relation matrices whose Frobenius normal form is such that all the diagonal blocks are primitive (A070322) and all the off diagonal blocks are 0-blocks.  See Gregory, Kirkland, Pullman.
%C A366218 The limit of a convergent binary relation R is an equivalence relation iff every vertex and every edge in G(R) is on a cycle, where G(R) is the directed graph with loops associated to R.  See Corollary to Theorem 1 in Rosenblatt.
