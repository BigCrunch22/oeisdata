%N A241922 Smallest k^2>=0 such that n-k^2 is semiprime, or a(n)=2 if there is no such k^2.
%C A241922 If n = m^2, m>=2, then the condition {a(n) differs from 2} is equivalent to the Goldbach binary conjecture. Indeed, if m^2 - k^2 is semiprime, then (m-k)*(m+k) = p*q, where p<=q are primes. Here we consider two possible cases. 1) m-k=1, m+k=p*q and 2) m-k=p, m+k=q. But in the first case k=m-1>m-p, i.e., more than k in the second case. In view of the minimality k, we only have to consider case 2). In this case we have m-/+k both are primes p<=q (with equality in case k=0) and thus 2*m = p + q. Conversely, let the Goldbach conjecture be true. Then for a perfect square n>=4, we have 2*sqrt(n)=p+q (p<=q are both primes). Thus n=((p+q)/2)^2 and n-((p-q)/2)^2=p*q is semiprime. Hence a(n) is a square not exceeding ((p-q)/2)^2.
%C A241922 Note that a(n)=2 for 1,2,3,12,17,28,32,72,...
%C A241922 All these numbers are in A100570. Thus the Goldbach binary conjecture is true if and only if A100570 does not contain perfect squares.
%C A241922 The largest term found in the first 2^28 terms is a(106956964) = 369^2 = 136161. This further encourages one to believe that Goldbach's binary conjecture holds true. - _Daniel Mikhail_, Nov 23 2020
