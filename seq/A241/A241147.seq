%N A241147 a(n) = the number of integers i in {1,2,...,L}, where L = lcm(1,2,...,n), having the property that the number of positive integer divisors of i that are less than or equal to n, is odd.
%e A241147 For n = 4 we have a(n) = 7, since the divisors <=4 of 1,2,..., 12 are
%e A241147 {1}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,2,4}, {1}, {1,2,3}, {1}, {1,2,4}, {1,3}, {1,2}, {1}, and {1,2,3,4}, and only 7 of these have odd cardinality.
