%N A241079 If n is a perfect square, a(n) = 0. If n is not a perfect square, a(n) is the number of final digits necessary to rule out n as a perfect square, or -1 if cannot be ruled out as a perfect square using any group of final digits.
%C A241079 To define the n-digit ending of a number with fewer than n digits, insert 0's in front of it. For example, the 2-digit ending of 5 is 05.
%e A241079 a(24) cannot be 3 because 024 is a valid ending of a square (32^2 = 1024).
%Y A241079 Cf. A241081 (numbers k such that a(k) = -1).
