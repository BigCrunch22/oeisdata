%N A241898 a(n) is the largest integer such that n = a(n)^2 + ... is a decomposition of n into a sum of at most four nondecreasing squares.
%C A241898 This differs from A191090 only for n>=30 because 30 cannot be written as a sum of at most four squares without using 1^2, but 30 can be written as a sum of five nondecreasing squares: 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 3^2, making A191090(30)=2.
%C A241898 By Lagrange's Theorem every number can be written as a sum of four squares.  Can the same be said of the set of {a^2|a is any integer not equal to 7}? From the data that I have, it would seem that a(n) is greater than 7 for all n>599.  If this could be proved, it would only remain to check if all the numbers up to 599 can be written as the sum of 4 squares none of which is 7^2.

%e A241898 30 can be written as the sum of at most 4 nondecreasing squares in the following ways: 1^2 + 2^2 + 5^2 or 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2. Therefore, a(30)=1.
