%N A241605 a(n) = |{0 < k < sqrt(prime(n))*log(prime(n)) : k is not only a quadratic nonresidue modulo prime(n) but also a Fibonacci number}|.
%C A241605 It might seem that a(n) > 0 for all n > 2, but this is not true. In fact, for the prime p = prime(139570751) = 2893610639, the integer 1346269 is the least Fibonacci number which is a quadratic nonresidue modulo p, and 1346269/(sqrt(p)*log(p)) is approximately equal to 1.1488.
%C A241605 Conjecture: For any odd prime p, let f(p) be the least Fibonacci number which is a quadratic nonresidue modulo p. Then f(p) = o(p^(0.7)) as p tends to infinity. Moreover,f(p) = O(p^c) for any constant c > c_0 = log_2((1+sqrt(5))/2).
%C A241605 This refinement of the conjecture in A241568 seems reasonable in view of the heuristic arguments described below. Let c be any constant greater than c_0 (which has the approximating value 0.694). Roughly speaking, there are about (log_2(p^c))/c_0 positive Fibonacci numbers below p^c. Suppose that a positive Fibonacci number is a quadratic residue modulo a fixed odd prime p with "probability" 1/2. Then we might expect that the "probability" for all positive Fibonacci numbers below p^c being quadratic residues modulo p is about (1/2)^(c*(log_2 p)/c_0) = 1/p^(c/c_0). As sum_p 1/p^(c/c_0) converges, it seems reasonabale to think that there are only finitely many odd primes p for which all positive Fibonacci numbers below p^c are quadratic residues mod p.
