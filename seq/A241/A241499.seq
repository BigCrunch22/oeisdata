%N A241499 a(n)= k is the number of consecutive primes of the form 10^d - prime(n), 10^(d+1)- prime(n),...,10^(d+k-1)- prime(n) where d is the number of decimal digits of prime(n).
%C A241499 The growth of a(n) is very slow. The smallest prime p such that the number of consecutive primes is equal to n for n = 0, 1, 2,... is given by the sequence b(n) = 2, 5, 17, 3, 71, 535673,... (hard).
%e A241499 a(2) = 3 because prime(2)= 3 => 10^1-3 = 7, 10^2-3 = 97 and 10^3-3 = 997  with three consecutive primes, but 10^4-3 = 9997 = 13*769 is composite.
