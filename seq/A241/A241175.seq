%N A241175 Numbers which cannot be obtained by adding some digit of a number m to m.
%C A241175 Presumably there are no further terms.
%C A241175 Proof: We can check explicitly that there is no further term below 1000. Any larger number is of the form n = a*1000 + b, a > 0, with either 0 <= b < 100 (in which case n has a digit '0' and n = n + 0 is not in the sequence) or 87 < b < 1000 in which case b is not in this sequence, thus b = m+d where d is a digit of m and therefore also of a*1000 + m and therefore n = (a*1000 + m) + d is not in this sequence. - _M.

%e A241175 Since 23 = 21+2, 23 is not on this list.
%e A241175 Numbers having a digit '0' can be written as n+0 and are excluded.
%e A241175 Numbers ending in digits d = 2, 4, 6 or 8 can be written as sum of m = n - d/2 and the trailing digit of m, d/2.
