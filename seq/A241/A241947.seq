%N A241947 Numbers n for which A241927(n) = 2.
%C A241947 If the sequence contains no perfect squares>4, then the Goldbach conjecture in Fermi-Dirac arithmetic (FDGC) is true (see comment in A241927).
%C A241947 Essentially, the sequence is the Fermi-Dirac analog of A100570. Since A100570 is conjecturally finite, it is natural to suppose that this sequence is also finite.
%C A241947 There is not another term up to 10^6. - _Peter J. C. Moses_, May 05 2014
%C A241947 Thus, if 20 is the last term of the sequence, then the FDGC is true. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, May 05 2014
%Y A241947 Cf. A241927, A241922, A100570.
