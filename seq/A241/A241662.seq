%N A241662 Numbers of the form m * 10^k where gcd(10, m) = 1 and k >= 0 and m > 0.
%C A241662 Also natural numbers x such that fractions of the form x/10^r, after reduction to lowest terms, still have a power of ten in the denominator.
%C A241662 Superset of A045572, and every member of a(n) arises from a member of A045572 by appending zero or more '0' digits at the right.
%F A241662 a(n) = 9n/4 + O(log n). - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, May 14 2014
%e A241662 19/10 is already fully reduced, and has a power of 10 in its denominator, so 19 is in the sequence;
%e A241662 30/100 reduces to 3/10, which has a power of 10 in its denominator, so 30 is in the sequence;
%e A241662 12/10, 15/100, and 20/100 reduce to 6/5, 3/20, and 1/5, respectively (none of which has a power of 10 in its denominator), so 12, 15, and 20 are not in the sequence.
