%N A241813 Numbers disqualified from being in A019505 for not being the smallest number with their respective number of divisors.
%C A241813 It appears that when 2*A019505(n) is a member of this sequence then the exponent in at least one primary of the factorization of A019505(n+1) is smaller than in the corresponding primary of A019505(n) or A019505(n+1) contains an additional prime factor. The smallest example in this sequence where two primaries have smaller exponents and an additional prime factor is added is a(14) = 2*A019505(43) = 2 * 97772875200 = 195545750400. The sequence of exponents of its primaries is (7, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1 ) while A019505(44) = 160626866400 has exponent sequence (5, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1 ). - _Hartmut F. W. Hoft_, Feb 22 2023
%e A241813 8 qualifies because 8 = 4*2 and 4 is in A019505, but 8 can't be term after 4 in A019505 because smallest number with 4 divisors is 6.
