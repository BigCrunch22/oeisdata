%N A241954 Number of integers x such that the repeated application of sigma(x)->x leads to n.
%C A241954 If n is A007369 (sigma(x) = n has no solution) then a(n) = 0.
%C A241954 Obviously a(n) >= A054973(n), number of solutions to sigma(x) = n.
%C A241954 The equality is obtained for terms of A007369, but not only: see a(n) for 1, 3, 6, 13, 18, 20, 30, 31, 36, 38 ...
%C A241954 The maxima for a(n) are : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 14, 15 ... and are obtained for n: 1, 4, 7, 8, 15, 24, 60, 120, ...

%e A241954 There is a single integer such that sigma(x) = 1 so a(1) = 1.
%e A241954 For n=4, we have only sigma(3) = 4 and sigma(sigma(2)) = 4, so a(4) = 2.
%e A241954 For n=7, we have only sigma(4) = 7, sigma(sigma(3)) = 7, and sigma(sigma(sigma(2))) = 7, so a(7) = 3.
%o A241954 (PARI) isok(i, n) = {j = i; while((k = sigma(j)) < n, j = k); k == n;}
