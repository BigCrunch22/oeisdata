%N A241201 a(n) is the least r such that there are n+2 consecutive increasing terms in the r-th row of Pascal's triangle (binomial(r,*)) which satisfy a polynomial of degree n.
%C A241201 Old definition: "Numbers k such that n+2 consecutive terms of binomial(n,k) satisfy a polynomial relation of degree n for some k in the range 0 <= k <= n/2.".
%C A241201 Is this sequence finite?
%e A241201 a(1) = 7 because the 3 terms 7, 21, 35 are linear.
%t A241201 t = Table[k = 1; While[b = Binomial[k, Range[0, k/2]]; d = Differences[b, n + 1]; ! MemberQ[d, 0], k++]; {k, Position[d, 0, 1, 1][[1, 1]] - 1}, {n, 6}]; Transpose[t][[1]]
%Y A241201 Cf. A008865 (binomial(n,k) has 3 consecutive terms in a linear relation).
%Y A241201 Cf. A062730 (3 terms in arithmetic progression in Pascal's triangle).
