%e A241914 Viewed as an irregular table, the sequence is constructed as:
%e A241914 "Row"
%e A241914   [1] 0; (by convention, a(1)=0)
%e A241914   [2] 0; (because A061395(2)=1 (the index of the largest prime factor), we have here terms from 0 to 1-1)
%e A241914   [3] 0, 1; (because A061395(3)=2, we have terms from 0 to 2-1)
%e A241914   [4] 0;
%e A241914   [5] 0, 1, 2; (because A061395(5)=3, we have terms from 0 to 3-1)
%e A241914   [6] 0, 1;    (because A061395(6)=2, we have terms from 0 to 2-1)
%e A241914   [7] 0, 1, 2, 3; (because A061395(7)=4, we have terms from 0 to 4-1)
