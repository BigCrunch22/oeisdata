%N A043570 Numbers whose base-2 representation has exactly 3 runs.
%C A043570 Numbers of the form 2^n - 2^m + 2^k - 1 for n > m > k > 0. - _Robert Israel_, Jan 11 2018
%C A043570 A000051 \ {2, 3} is a subsequence, since the base-2 representation of a number of the form 2^k+1 > 3 consists of a single 1, followed by a block of k-1 0's, followed by a last single 1. Also, A000215 \ {3} is an other subsequence, since the base-2 representation of a Fermat number 2^(2^k)+1 > 3 consists of a single 1, followed by a block of 2^k-1 0's, followed by a last single 1. - _Bernard Schott_, Mar 09 2023
%C A043570 Numbers k such that A005811(k) = 3. - _Michel Marcus_, Mar 10 2023
