%N A256147 First repeated number in Sylvester's sequence modulo prime(n).
%C A256147 Sylvester's sequence (A000058) is an infinite coprime sequence, a fact that may lead to the incorrect intuition that all primes occur as factors of its terms. It's quite easy to check that no multiple of 5 occurs, since Sylvester's sequence modulo 5 is 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, ...
%C A256147 If a multiple of p occurs in Sylvester's sequence at position j, then A000058(k) == 1 (mod p) for all k > j.
%C A256147 But if no multiple of p occurs in Sylvester's sequence at all, then Sylvester's sequence is fully periodic modulo p or it enters a cycle at some point.

%e A256147 a(4) = 1, because the fourth prime is 7 and Sylvester's sequence modulo 7 is 2, 3, 0, 1, 1, 1, ...
%e A256147 a(5) = 3, because the fifth prime is 11 and Sylvester's sequence modulo 11 is 2, 3, 7, 10, 3, 7, 10, 3, 7, 10, ... (3 is the first number repeated).
