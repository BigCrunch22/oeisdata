%N A256940 a(n) is the total number of free ends of a certain configuration of line segments after n iterations (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A256940 The initial pattern is a straight line segment which has 2 free ends: a(0)=2.
%C A256940 The construction rules for the following generations are:
%C A256940 (i) add 2 line segments (all line segments are of equal length) at each free end of previous generation by arranging them in a "V" shape at angle Pi/2 and symmetrically placed at the free end,
%C A256940 (ii) overlaps among different generations are prohibited,
%C A256940 (iii) the {a(n)} free ends are the ends of elements that do not toucht or cross the others.
%C A256940 It seems that a(n) drop to 16 for n = 8, 16, 32, 64,... . See illustration in the links.
%C A256940 The structure of the illustration of initial terms is very similar to the structure of A194270 and A220500. The terms of this sequence should be checked! - _Omar E. Pol_, Apr 19 2015
