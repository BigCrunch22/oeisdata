%N A256750 Start with n, and repeatedly apply the arithmetic derivative A003415. |a(n)| = the number of iterations to reach 0 (then a(n) is taken nonnegative) or a number having a factor of the form p^p with prime p, in which case a(n) = -|a(n)|.
%C A256750 Under iterations of the arithmetic derivative, the orbit of some numbers ends in zero, and the orbit of all others (I conjecture) reaches a number of the form m*p^p with prime p, from where on it keeps this form and grows to infinity iff m>1, or remains at this fixed point if m=1.
%C A256750 This is an extension of the sequence A099307 which counts the steps to reach 0 or yields 0 if this never happens.

%F A256750 a(n) = 0 <=> n = 0 or n = m*p^p for some prime p and some m >= 1 (which is a fixed point iff m = 1).
%F A256750 a(n) = 1 <=> n = 1.
%F A256750 a(n) = 2 <=> n is prime.
%F A256750 a(n) <= 0 <=> n is in A099309 U {0}. If n > 0, the iterations of A003415 applied to n end in a nonzero fixed point or grow to infinity.
%F A256750 a(n) > 0 <=> n is in A099308 \ {0}.
