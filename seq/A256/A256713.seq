%N A256713 Number of integers m in [0..10^n-1] such that m has no digit in common with the last n digits of m^2.
%e A256713 For n=2:
%e A256713 m = 89, m^2 = 7921 and 21 has no digit in common with 89 so it is counted.
%e A256713 m = 91, m^2 = 8281 and 81 has digit 1 in common with 91 so it is not counted.
%e A256713 m = 1, m^2 = 1 has digit 1 in common so it is not counted.
%e A256713 For n=3:
%e A256713 m = 962, m^2 = 925444 and 444 has no digit in common with 962 so it is counted.
%e A256713 m = 963, m^2 = 927369 and 369 has all digits in common with 963 so it is not counted.
