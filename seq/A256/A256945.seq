%N A256945 Number of periods of reduced indefinite binary quadratic forms with discriminant D(n) = A079896(n).
%C A256945 This is an ``imprimitive'' class number.  Each a(n) is A087048(n) increased by the number of cycles of discriminant D(n) of imprimitive binary quadratic forms.
%C A256945 The gcd of the coefficients is the same for each form within a cycle, so is a cycle invariant.  There will exist cycles with gcd invariant equal to k precisely when D(n)/k^2 = A079896(m) for some m.  In this case, the number of such cycles is A087048(m).
%F A256945 a(n) is the sum A087048(m) over all integers m with D(m)= D(n)/k^2  for some integer k.
%e A256945 a(5) gives the number of cycles of reduced indefinite forms of discriminant D(5) = 20.  This is the sum A087048(0) + A087048(5) = 2.
%Y A256945 Cf. A079896, A087048.
