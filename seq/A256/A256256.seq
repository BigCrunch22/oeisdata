%N A256256 Total number of ON cells after n generations of cellular automaton on triangular grid, starting from a node, in which every 60-degree wedge looks like the Sierpiński's triangle.
%C A256256 Analog of A160720, but here we are working on the triangular lattice.
%C A256256 The first differences (A256257) gives the number of triangular cells turned ON at every generation.
%C A256256 Also 6 times the sum of all entries in rows 0 to n of Sierpiński's triangle A047999.
%C A256256 Also 6 times the total number of odd entries in first n rows of Pascal's triangle A007318, see formula section.
%C A256256 The structure contains three distinct kinds of polygons formed by triangular ON cells: the initial hexagon, rhombuses (each one formed by two ON cells) and unit triangles.
%C A256256 Note that if n is a power of 2 greater than 2, the structure looks like concentric hexagons with triangular holes, where some of them form concentric stars.

%F A256256 a(n) = 6*A006046(n).
%e A256256 On the infinite triangular grid we start with all triangular cells turned OFF, so a(0) = 0.
%e A256256 At stage 1, in the structure there are six triangular cells turned ON forming a regular hexagon, so a(1) = 6.
%e A256256 At stage 2, there are 12 new triangular ON cells forming six rhombuses around the initial hexagon, so a(2) = 6 + 12 = 18.
%e A256256 And so on.
