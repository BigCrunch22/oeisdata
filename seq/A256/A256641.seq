%N A256641 a(n) is the total number of free ends of 5 line segments expansion at n iterations (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A256641 The initial pattern consists of 5 straight line segments which are the radii of a regular pentagon. Their free ends are the ends of elements that do not contact or cross the other ones. Overlaps among different generations are prohibited except for one segment that connects between center points.
%C A256641 It appears that the sequence would be analog to 5*A032766 if the overlaps among different generations were prohibited without exception. See illustration in the links.
%C A256641 The terms of this sequence should be checked. - _Omar E. Pol_, Apr 13 2015
