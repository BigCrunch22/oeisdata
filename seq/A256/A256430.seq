%N A256430 The least positive integer in A055744 divisible by A008578(n).
%C A256430 Subset of A256431. Elements from this sequence can be used to find elements from A256431. For example, 18 and 50 are the least number in this sequence divisible by 3 and 5 respectively. These numbers can be used to find the least number in A055744 divisible by both 3 and 5 as follows: 18 = 2^1 * 3^2 and 50 = 2^1 * 5^2. 'Order' these factors together: 2^1|2^1|3^2|5^2. For two consecutive factors, if they have the same base, remove the one with the highest exponent. Leaves 2^1|3^2|5^2. Multiply these factors together. Gives 2 * 3^2 * 5^2 = 450. So 450 is in A256431. This method can be applied recursively to find the least n in A055744 divisible by 3, 5 and 7, for example; applying this to 294 and 450 gives 7350 which is the least element in A055744 divisible by primes 3, 5 and 7.
