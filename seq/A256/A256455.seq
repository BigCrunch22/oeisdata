%N A256455 Numbers that appear at least once in a Pythagorean triple (a, b, b+1).
%C A256455 Includes all odd numbers >= 3 because every odd number a has a Pythagorean triple (a, b, b+1).
%C A256455 Union of A144396 and A046092 (except for 0). - _Robert Israel_, Mar 29 2015
%e A256455 12 qualifies because it's part of (5, 12, 13). 8 doesn't qualify because no Pythagorean triple of the form (a, b, b+1) has 8 in it; in every triple of this kind, b is the only even number, and a in the triple (a, 8, 9) would be the square root of 17, which is not an integer.
