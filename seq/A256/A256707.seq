%N A256707 Number of unordered ways to write n as the sum of two distinct elements of the set {floor(x/3): 3*x-1 and 3*x+1 are twin primes}.
%C A256707 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 0. Moreover, for any integer m > 10 every positive integer can be written as the sum of two distinct elements of the set {floor(x/m): x-1 and x+1 are twin prime}.
%C A256707 Clearly, the conjecture implies the Twin Prime Conjecture.
