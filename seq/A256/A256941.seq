%N A256941 a(n) is the number of free ends of a certain configuration of line segments after n iterations (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A256941 All line segments are equal length. The initial pattern is a straight line segment. It has 2 free ends, so a(0)=2. The construction rules for generation n >= 1 are:
%C A256941 (i) subject to rule ii, add 2 line segments at each free end by arranging in a "V" shape with angle Pi/3 and connecting symmetrically to the free end (nearly like a 3-handed clock showing 07:00:25);
%C A256941 (ii) a "V" is not added if either of its segments would cross a line segment drawn in an earlier generation;
%C A256941 (iii) when generation n is complete, each new line segment clearly touches 2 line segments where it was initially attached; the other end of the new line segment counts as being free if the segment does not touch or cross any more line segments.
%C A256941 a(n) is the number of free ends created in generation n.
%C A256941 It seems that a(n) drops to 24 for n = 5, 9, 17, 33, 65, ... . See illustrations in the links.
