%N A256749 a(n) is the time expressed in seconds starting at 0:00:00 at which the second-hand of a classical three hands clock is passing over any of the two other hands considering the minute-hand turns of 6 degrees in one minute and the hour-hand of 6 degrees in 12 minutes.
%C A256749 The sequence is given for its first 1249 terms which corresponds to 12 hours. At 12:00:00 the clock is back to its initial state but as the time wheel keeps on turning a(1248) = 43200 + a(0) , a(1249) = 43200 + a(1), a(n + p*1248) = a(n) + p*43200 for any nonnegative integer p.
%e A256749 a(0) = 0 as the second-hand is over the minute-hand and the hour-hand at 0:00:00,
%e A256749 a(1) = 60 as the second-hand is over the hour-hand at 0:01:00,
%e A256749 a(2) = 61 as the second-hand is over the minute-hand at 0:01:01,...
%e A256749 a(23) = 721 as the second-hand is over the hour-hand at 0:12:01.
