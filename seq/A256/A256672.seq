%N A256672 Number of idempotents in the Motzkin monoid of degree n.
%C A256672 a(n) is the number of ways of drawing any number of nonintersecting chords joining n (labeled) points on a circle, such that when gluing the second half of one copy to the first half of the other so that each point k along the intersection is glued to n+1-k, the result is homotopic to the original.
%C A256672 a(n+1) > a(n) for every n.
%C A256672 The structure of the Motzkin monoid (and particularly its idempotents and some associated orderings) is governed intimately by the combinatorics of so-called Motzkin paths and Motzkin words, which are related to Dyck paths and words respectively by insertion of punctuation into the words, or marking/coloring subpaths.
%C A256672 Bounded above by A026945, strictly for n > 1. Bounded below by the square of A001006, strictly for n > 1.

%e A256672 There is one empty graph, which is idempotent under the composition, hence a(0)=1.
%e A256672 There are two on 1 pair of points, the clique and the discrete graph; both are idempotents under the composition, hence a(1)=2.
