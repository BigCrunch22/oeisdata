%N A256714 Number of integers m in [0..10^n-1] such that m has no digit in common with the last n digits of either m^2 or m^3.
%e A256714 For n=2:
%e A256714 m = 22, m^2 = 484, m^3 = 10648 and neither 84 nor 48 has a digit in common with 22 so it is counted.
%e A256714 m = 23, m^2 = 529, m^3 = 12167 and 29 has digit 2 in common with 23 so it is not counted.
%e A256714 m = 28, m^2 = 784, m^3 = 21952 and both 84 and 52 has a digit in common with 28 so it is not counted.
%e A256714 For n=3:
%e A256714 m = 47, m^2 = 2209, m^3 = 103823 and neither 209 nor 823 has a digit in common with 47 so it is counted.
%e A256714 m = 48, m^2 = 2304, m^3 = 110592 and 304 has digit 4 in common with 48 so it is not counted.
