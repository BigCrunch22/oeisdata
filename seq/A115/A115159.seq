%N A115159 Numbers that are not the sum of a triangular number, a square and a fourth power.
%C A115159 There are 718 such numbers up to 2*10^9, the last one in this range being 99570649.
%C A115159 It is known that each natural number can be written as the sum of two squares and a triangular number. I believe that the sequence only has 718 terms as found by __Giovanni Resta_ and listed in the b-file. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Apr 15 2020
