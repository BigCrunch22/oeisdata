%N A115403 Numbers k such that k^3+1 is 3-almost prime (product of three primes).
%C A115403 It appears that there is only one known example of three consecutive primes p, q, r whose product is 1 more than a perfect cube, namely 7*11*13 = 1001 and that probably no other examples exist. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 27 2008
