%N A115842 Self-describing sequence. The n-th integer of the sequence indicates how many integers of the sequence are strictly < 8n.
%C A115842 Terms computed by Gilles Sadowski. In building step by step the sequence one has sometimes the choice for an integer. If so take the smallest available one.
%e A115842 A(7)=13 because there are 13 integers in the sequence which are strictly < 56 (they are 1,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,24,32,40,48)
