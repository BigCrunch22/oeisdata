%N A115516 The mode of the bits of n (using 0 if bimodal).
%C A115516 If n is a term of A044951, A115517(n) = a(n); otherwise, A115517(n) = 1 and a(n) = 0 (and n is a term of A031443).
%H A115516 Paolo Xausa, <a href="/A115516/b115516.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..10000</a>
%F A115516 a(A031443(k))=0 for k>=1.
%e A115516 a(5)=1 because 5 = 101 (binary) and 0 occurs once, but 1 occurs twice, so 1 is the mode. 5 is a member of A044951 (Numbers with no two equally numerous base 2 digits).
%e A115516 a(10)=0 because 10 = 1010 (binary), where 0 and 1 each occur twice. As these bits are bimodal, 0 is chosen. 10 is a member of A031443 (Digitally balanced numbers: numbers which in base 2 have the same number of 0's as 1's.).

%Y A115516 Cf. A115517 (same but use 1 if bimodal), A031443 (n's bits bimodal), A044951 (n's bits unimodal), A115353 (mode of n's decimal digits).
