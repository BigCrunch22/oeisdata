%N A115837 Self-describing sequence. The n-th integer of the sequence indicates how many integers of the sequence are strictly < 3n.
%C A115837 Terms computed by Gilles Sadowski. In building step by step the sequence one has sometimes the choice for an integer. If so take the smallest available one.
%C A115837 Is this the same sequence as A080710? - _Andrew S. Plewe_, May 08 2007
