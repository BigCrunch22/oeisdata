%N A115755 Number of permutations of n elements whose unsigned reversal distance is k.
%C A115755 Probably an erroneous version of A300003. Some inner terms of the triangle differ slightly. Sean A. Irvine reread the paper and checked manually that a(13) should be 52. The last row 1, 36, 820 ... 6352, 2 was added later and is ok. - _Georg Fischer_, Feb 24 2020

%e A115755 a(3,1) = 3 because the only three permutations of S_3 that require exactly one reversal to be sorted are (1 3 2), (2 1 3) and (3 2 1).
%Y A115755 Cf. A300003.
