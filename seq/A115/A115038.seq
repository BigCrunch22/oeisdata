%N A115038 Smallest x such that x^2 + p is a perfect power over the set of primes p.
%C A115038 Conjecture: There will always be an x,y,n such that x^2 + p = y^n for all primes p. In otherwords, there is a one-one mapping of the prime numbers to y^n - x^2 for some x,y,n. Therefore primes of the form y^n - x^2 are infinite in number.
%e A115038 5 is the smallest number that when we add its square to prime 2, we get a
%e A115038 perfect power, 3^3. 1 is the smallest number that when we add its square to
%e A115038 prime 3, we get a perfect power, 2^2. So 5 and 1 are the first two entries in
%e A115038 the table.
