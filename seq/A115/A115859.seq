%N A115859 Largest natural number m < n, such that there exists nonzero solutions to a cross-domain congruence m*i = n X i, zero if no such integer exists.
%C A115859 Here * stands for ordinary multiplication and X means carryless (GF(2)[X]) multiplication (A048720).
%H A115859 <a href="/index/Con#CongruCrossDomain">Index entries for sequences defined by congruent products between domains N and GF(2)[X]</a>
%Y A115859 a(2n) = 2*a(n). Bisection A115860 gives the terms at odd positions. Differs from A115869 for the first time at n=23, where a(23)=19, while A115869(23)=15. Cf. A115857, A115861, A115871.
