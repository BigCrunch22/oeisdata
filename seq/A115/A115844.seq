%N A115844 Self-describing sequence. The n-th integer of the sequence indicates how many integers of the sequence are strictly < 10n.
%C A115844 Terms computed by Gilles Sadowski. In building step by step the sequence one has sometimes the choice for an integer. If so take the smallest available one.
%e A115844 A(7)=15 because there are 15 integers in the sequence which are strictly < 70 (they are 1,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,20,30,40,50,60)
