%N A115862 Triangle where a(1,1)=0; a(n,m) is number of terms among the first (n-1) terms of A115863 that are not coprime to m. A115863(n) is the sum of the terms of the n-th row of A115862.
%C A115862 If a(1,1) were instead 1, then row 2 would be [0,0] and the rest of the triangle would be the same as when a(1,1) = 0. For our purposes, 0 is considered to be coprime only with 1.
%e A115862 The first 5 terms of A115863 are 0,1,2,5 and 7. Among these terms 0 are not coprime with 1, 2 are not coprime with 2, 1 is not coprime with 3, 2 are not coprime with 4, 2 are not coprime with 5 and 2 are not coprime with 6.
%e A115862 So row 6 of the triangle is [0,2,1,2,2,2].
%e A115862 (And so A115863(6) = 0 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9.)
