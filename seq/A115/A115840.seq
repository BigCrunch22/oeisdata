%N A115840 Self-describing sequence. The n-th integer of the sequence indicates how many integers of the sequence are strictly < 6n.
%C A115840 Terms computed by Gilles Sadowski. In building step by step the sequence one has sometimes the choice for an integer. If so take the smallest available one.
%e A115840 A(7)=12 because there are 12 integers in the sequence which are strictly < 42 (they are 1,6,7,8,9,10,12,18,24,30,36,37)
