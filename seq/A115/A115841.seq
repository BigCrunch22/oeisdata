%N A115841 Self-describing sequence. The n-th integer of the sequence indicates how many integers of the sequence are strictly < 7n.
%C A115841 Terms computed by Gilles Sadowski. In building step by step the sequence one has sometimes the choice for an integer. If so take the smallest available one.
%e A115841 A(7)=12 because there are 12 integers in the sequence which are strictly < 49 (they are 1,7,8,9,10,11,12,14,21,28,35,42)
