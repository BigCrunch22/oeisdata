%N A115843 Self-describing sequence. The n-th integer of the sequence indicates how many integers of the sequence are strictly < 9n.
%C A115843 Terms computed by Gilles Sadowski. In building step by step the sequence one has sometimes the choice for an integer. If so take the smallest available one.
%e A115843 A(7)=14 because there are 14 integers in the sequence which are strictly < 63 (they are 1,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,18,27,36,45,54)
