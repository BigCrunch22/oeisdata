%N A115838 Self-describing sequence. The n-th integer of the sequence indicates how many integers of the sequence are strictly < 4n.
%C A115838 Terms computed by Gilles Sadowski. In building step by step the sequence one has sometimes the choice for an integer. If so take the smallest available one.
%e A115838 A(7)=16 because there are 16 integers in the sequence which are strictly < 28 (they are 1,4,5,6,8,12,16,17,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27).
