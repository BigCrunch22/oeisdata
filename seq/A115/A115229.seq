%N A115229 Number of ways in chess to force mate in n moves for a single knight against a single pawn, without duals, without short mates and excluding rotations, mirroring and color reversing.
%C A115229 The mate is only possible against a pawn on a border line (a-line or h-line).
%C A115229 No non-dual (single solution) mates are possible beyond n = 7 (cf. Springerzauber, page 178).
%C A115229 Obviously the positions with the higher number of moves lead via a unique chain of positions with the lower numbers.
