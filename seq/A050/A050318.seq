%N A050318 a(n) is the number of ways to write n as an mterm, where an mterm is an unordered sum which is either 2, or 1 + an unordered product of mterms.
%C A050318 P. Freyd (see link) writes: A050318 is "the number of isomorphism types of [equationally linear Heyting semi-lattices] of order n ..., albeit shifted by 1." And: "A050318 shifted by 1 is the number of isomorphism types of distributive lattices in which any element below a coprime is itself a coprime. Which ... is the same as the number of distributive lattices in which any element above a prime is itself a prime." - _Peter Luschny_, Nov 13 2018

%e A050318 The different ways of writing the numbers 2 through 7 as mterms are:
%e A050318   2 = 2,
%e A050318   3 = 1 + 2,
%e A050318   4 = 1 + (1+2),
%e A050318   5 = 1 + (1+1+2) = 1 + 2*2,
%e A050318   6 = 1 + (1+1+1+2) = 1 + (1+2*2),
%e A050318   7 = 1 + (1+1+1+1+2) = 1 + (1+1+2*2) = 1 + 2*(1+2).
