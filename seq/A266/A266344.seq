%N A266344 a(n) = number of ways n can be divided into two factors that have the same number of digits in factorial base representation (the two different orders for unequal factors are counted only once).

%F A266344 a(n) = Sum_{d|n} [(d <= (n/d)) and (A084558(d) = A084558(n/d))].
%F A266344 (In the above formula [ ] stands for Iverson bracket, giving as its result 1 only if d is less than or equal to n/d and in factorial base representation d and n/d require equal number of digits, and 0 otherwise.)
%e A266344 1 can be factored just one way, as 1*1, and thus a(1) = 1.
%e A266344 4 can be factored as 2*2, and thus also a(4) = 1, and generally for all perfect squares k, a(k) >= 1.
%e A266344 14 can be factored as 2*7, but as A007623(2) = 2 and A007623(7) = 101, with different number of digits in factorial base (and 1*14 fares even less well), a(14) = 0.
%e A266344 72 can be factored to two divisors so that the factorial base representations are of equal length as 6*12 or 8*9 (where the corresponding factorial base representations are "100" * "200" and "110" * "111"), thus a(72) = 2.
%e A266344 120 can be similarly factored as 6*20 ("100" * "310"), 8*15 ("110" * "211") and 10*12 ("120" * "200"), thus a(120) = 3.
