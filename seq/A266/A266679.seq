%N A266679 Positive integers not shotgun (or Schrotschuss) numbers, in order of the first number to be permuted forward by the transformations T[k] where k = 2 or k is odd.
%C A266679 In the construction of the shotgun numbers (A064494), the first element to be shifted forward by T[k] where k = 2 or k is odd will also be shifted forward by subsequent transformations T[2^n*k], and will therefore not appear in that sequence. In particular, no prime numbers appear in A064494, and an odd prime p is element (p+1)/2 in this list.
%Y A266679 Cf. A064494. Sorted gives A064627.
