%N A266342 a(n) = number of ways n can be expressed as a product of two natural numbers that have same number of significant digits in base-2 representation (up to the ordering of unequal factors).

%F A266342 a(n) = Sum_{d|n} [(d <= (n/d)) and (A000523(d) = A000523(n/d))].
%F A266342 (In the above formula [ ] stands for Iverson bracket, resulting in 1 only if d is less than or equal to n/d and the binary lengths of d and n/d are equal, and 0 otherwise.)
%e A266342 For n=1 we have one possibility, 1*1 = 1, thus a(1) = 1.
%e A266342 For n=2 we have no choices, as the binary representation of 1 which is "1" is shorter than the binary representation of 2 which is "10", thus a(2) = 0 (and likewise for any prime).
%e A266342 For n=120 we have two choices, either 8*15 (in binary "1000" * "1111") or 10*12 ("1010" * "1100"), thus a(120) = 2. (15*8 and 8*15 are not counted separately.)
