%N A266948 Least prime p such that p-2 and 6n-p are also prime, or 0 if no such prime exists.
%C A266948 Goldbach conjecture related: Group the consecutive even numbers in groups of three, (6n-2, 6n, 6n+2). The existence of a(n) corresponds to a Goldbach decomposition 6n = p + (6n-p) using the upper of a twin prime pair. Then 6n-2 = (p-2) + 6n-p is automatically a valid Goldbach decomposition of 6n-2, and 6n+2 = p + 6n+2-p is such a decomposition for 6n+2 if 6n+2-p (or 6n+4-p) is prime.
%C A266948 Zwillinger conjectured already in 1978 that for all n > 701 there is a p such that all these conditions are satisfied (not necessarily p = a(n)). See also A266952 - A266953.
%C A266948 This conjecture implies that a(n) > 0 for all n > 1.
%C A266948 See A266950 - A266951 for record values and indices. For easier reference we list some of these [n, a(n)] here: [21, 13]; [133, 139]; [1759, 241]; [10919, 643],  [112723, 1621]; [1072318, 2311], [1458993, 3001], [2617393, 3301], ...
%C A266948 Since a larger value of a(n) indicates that it was "difficult" to find a suitable twin prime p, this slow growth is a strong evidence that a(n) > 0 for all n > 1.
