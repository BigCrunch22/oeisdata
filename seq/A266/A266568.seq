%N A266568 a(n) = smallest k such that 2^k ends in a string of exactly n nonzero digits.
%C A266568 Since 2^a(n) must have at least n digits, a(n) >= (n-1)*log_2(10).
%C A266568 The 26-digit number 2^86 = 77371252455336267181195264 is almost certainly the largest power of 2 that contains no zero digit.
%C A266568 A notably low local minimum occurs at a(36) = 129, which is less than a(n) for all n > 26.
%C A266568 A notably high local maximum occurs at a(122) = 11267047.
%e A266568 2^0 = 1 is the smallest power of 2 ending in a string ("1") of exactly 1 nonzero digit, so a(1) = 0.
%e A266568 2^4 = 16 is the smallest power of 2 ending in a string ("16") of exactly 2 nonzero digits, so a(2) = 4.
%e A266568 2^50 = 1125899906842624 is the smallest power of 2 ending in a string ("6842624") of exactly 7 nonzero digits, so a(7) = 50.
%e A266568 The last 7 digits of 2^24 = 16777216 -- i.e., "6777216" -- are also nonzero, but so is the preceding digit, so 2^24 ends in a string of exactly 8 nonzero digits. Since no smaller power of 2 ends in exactly 8 nonzero digits, a(8) = 24.
