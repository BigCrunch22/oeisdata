%N A266347 Numbers that cannot be represented as the product of two numbers with an equal number of significant digits (bits) in their binary representations.
%C A266347 All primes p are in the sequence since the only pair of divisors of p is {1, p} and since the smallest p = 2 has more bits than 1; all larger primes written in binary will require at least 2 bits to represent p. Thus A000040 is a subsequence of this sequence. - _Michael De Vlieger_, Dec 30 2015

%e A266347 From _Michael De Vlieger_, Dec 30 2015: (Start)
%e A266347 Consider pairs of divisors {d, d'} of n, both integers such that d * d' = n:
%e A266347 2 is a term, since the only pair of divisors of 2 written in binary are {1, 10}, with unequal numbers of bits.
%e A266347 3 is a term, since the only pair of divisors of 3 written in binary are {1, 11}, with unequal numbers of bits.
%e A266347 8 is a term, since the pair of divisors of 8 written in binary are {1, 100} and {10, 100}, both with unequal numbers of bits.
%e A266347 12 is a term, since the elements of {1, 1100}, {10, 110}, and {11, 100} are both unequal in length in all cases.
