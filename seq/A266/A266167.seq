%N A266167 Number of isotopism classes of unordered pairs of orthogonal Latin squares.
%C A266167 The following operations produce things that are counted as equivalent: simultaneous permutation of the rows or columns of both squares; permutation of the symbols within either square; interchanging the squares.
%C A266167 This sequence is also the number of trisotopism classes of *ordered* pairs of orthogonal Latin squares, where the following operations produce things that are counted as equivalent: simultaneous permutation of the rows or columns of both squares; permutation of the symbols within either square; transposing both squares.
