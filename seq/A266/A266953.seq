%N A266953 Least prime p such that p-2 and 6n-p and either 6n+2-p or 6n+4-p is also prime, or 0 if no such prime exists.
%C A266953 If a(n) > 0, then the triple {6n-2, 6n, 6n+2} of consecutive even numbers allows a "simultaneous Goldbach decomposition" using only 4 different primes, 6n-2 = p-2 + 6n-p ; 6n = p + 6n-p ; 6n+2 = p + 6n+2-p = p-2 + 6n+4-p.
%C A266953 See A266952 for the version which does not allow the second decomposition of the last member. See A266948 for a variant which does not require 6n+2-p to be prime.
%C A266953 Up to 10^5, the only indices for which a(n)=0 are {0, 1, 16, 86, 131, 151, 186, 191, 211, 226, 541, 701}. (Only 2 and 67 require the alternative primality of 6n+4-p and have thus A266952(n)=0.) I conjecture that this list is finite, and probably complete. Is it a coincidence that all odd numbers in this list are primes?
