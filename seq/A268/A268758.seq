%N A268758 Number of polyominoes with width and height equal to 2n that are invariant under all symmetries of the square.
%C A268758 Also number of polyominoes with width and height equal to 2n - 1 that are invariant under all symmetries of the square.
%C A268758 Bisection of A268339.
%C A268758 The water retention model for mathematical surfaces is described in the link below. The definition of a "lake" in this model is related to a class of polyominoes in A268339. Percolation theory may refer to these structures as "clusters that touch all boundaries."
%C A268758 Transportation across the square lattice requires a path of continuous edge connected cells. Is a pattern that only connects two opposite boundaries of the square ranked differently from one that connects all four boundaries?
%C A268758 This sequence is part of a effort to classify water retention patterns in a square by their symmetry, their capacity to connect boundaries of the square and the number of edge cells that are connected across opposite boundaries.

%e A268758 For a(2) = 3: the three polyominoes of width and height 2*2 - 1 = 3 and the corresponding three polynomial of width and height 2*2 = 4 are shown below. Note that each even-dimension polyomino is produced by duplicating the center row/column of an odd-dimension polyomino.
