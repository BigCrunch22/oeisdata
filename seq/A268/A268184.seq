%N A268184 Number of n-isohedral edge-to-edge tilings of regular polygons.
%C A268184 An n-isohedral tiling has n transitivity classes (or "orbits") of faces with respect to the symmetry group of the tiling.

%e A268184 The three 1-isohedral tilings are the regular tilings (triangles, squares, hexagons). Of the 13 2-isohedral tilings, there are three with triangles and squares, eight with triangles and hexagons, one with triangles and dodecagons, and one with squares and octagons.
%Y A268184 Analogous to the n-uniform edge-to-edge tilings, which has n orbits of vertices, as opposed to faces (A068599).
