%N A268084 Minimum number of occurrences of abelian squares in a binary word of length n.
%C A268084 A binary word is a sequence each member of which belongs to an alphabet of size 2 such as {a,b}. An abelian square is an even length factor whose first half is an anagram of the second half, for example abaaaaab.
%C A268084 One can also ask for the minimum number of distinct abelian squares in a word of length n and the minimum number of nonequivalent abelian squares. Two abelian squares are equivalent if they are anagrams of each other.
%C A268084 For example the word ababbaaabaa contains 5 distinct abelian squares, aa, bb, abab, abba and baaaba, but only 4 nonequivalent abelian squares since abab and abba are equivalent. It's conjectured that both the minimum number of distinct abelian squares in a binary word of length n and the minimum number of nonequivalent abelian squares equal floor(n/4)

%e A268084 For example the least number of occurrences of abelian squares in a binary word of length 11 is 7. There are 12 words which attain this minimum.  One is ababbaaabaa which contains 3 occurrences of aa and one each of bb, abab, abba and baaaba.
