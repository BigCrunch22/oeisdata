%N A268923 All odd primes a(n) such that for all odd primes q smaller than a(n) the order of 2 modulo a(n)*q is a proper divisor of phi(a(n)*q)/2. The totient function phi is given in A000010.
%C A268923 This sequence was inspired by A269454 submitted by _Marina Ibrishimova_.
%C A268923 It seems that if for an odd prime p > 3 the order(2, p*3) < phi(p*3)/2 = p-1 then p is in this sequence.
%C A268923 Note that 2^(phi(p*q)/2) == 1 (mod p*q) for distinct odd primes p and q, due to Nagell's corollary on Theorem 64, p. 106. The products of distinct primes considered in the present sequence have order of 2 modulo p*q smaller than phi(p*q)/2.
%C A268923 Up to and including prime(100) = 541 the only odd primes p such that for all odd primes q smaller than p the order of 2 modulo p*q equals phi(p*q)/2 are 5, 7, and 11.
%C A268923 Complement of A216371 = A001122 U A105874 in the set of odd primes. Composed of the primes modulo which neither 2 nor -2 is a primitive root. Also, prime(n) is a term iff A376010(n) > 2. - _Max Alekseyev_, Sep 05 2024
