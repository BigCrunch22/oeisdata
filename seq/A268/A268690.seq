%N A268690 A268642 with a(n+1) = 5*n if ceiling(a(n)/2) is already in the sequence.
%C A268690 It is conjectured that this is a permutation of the integers, along with any Seelmann sequence in which a(n+1) = M*n if the divide by 2 rule is not permitted, for any integer M>1 and not of the form M = 2^N.
