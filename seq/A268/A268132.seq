%N A268132 If a(n) is a square (and n > 1), then a(n+1) = a(n) + a(n-1), else a(n+1) is the smallest positive integer not occurring earlier.
%C A268132 A variant of the sequence A267758 where the relation has to hold for prime numbers rather than for squares.
%C A268132 Conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers (which could be enforced by definition). In case there would occur a duplicate, it must be of the form a(n+1) = a(n) + a(n-1) and equal to an earlier term a(m+1) of the same form, where furthermore the predecessor a(m-1) also is of that form, since otherwise a(m+1) would be smaller than this a(n+1). This seems extremely unlikely to happen, and maybe provably impossible.

%e A268132 a(26) = 25 is a square, thus followed by a(26) + a(25) = 25 + 24 = 49 which is again a square, thus followed by 49 + 25 = 74. Where is the next occurrence of two subsequent squares?
