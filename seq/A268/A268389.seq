%N A268389 a(n) = greatest k such that polynomial (X+1)^k divides the polynomial (in polynomial ring GF(2)[X]) that is encoded in the binary expansion of n. (See the comments for details).
%C A268389 a(n) gives the number of iterations of map k -> A006068(k)/2 that are required (when starting from k = n) until k is an odd number.
%C A268389 A001317 gives the record positions and particularly, A001317(n) gives the first occurrence of n in this sequence.
%C A268389 When polynomials over GF(2) are encoded in the binary representation of n in a natural way where each polynomial b(n)*X^n+...+b(0)*X^0 over GF(2) is represented by the binary number b(n)*2^n+...+b(0)*2^0 in N (each coefficient b(k) is either 0 or 1), then a(n) = the number of times polynomial X+1 (encoded by 3, "11" in binary) divides the polynomial encoded by n.

%F A268389 If A006068(n) is odd, then a(n) = 0, otherwise a(n) = 1 + a(A006068(n)/2).

%F A268389 A048720(A268669(n),A048723(3,a(n))) = A048720(A268669(n),A001317(a(n))) = n.
%F A268389 A048724^a(n) (A268669(n)) = n. [The a(n)-th fold application (power) of A048724 when applied to A268669(n) gives n back.]

%e A268389 For n = 5 ("101" in binary) which encodes polynomial x^2 + 1, we see that it can be factored over GF(2) as (X+1)(X+1), and thus a(5) = 2.
%e A268389 For n = 8 ("1000" in binary) which encodes polynomial x^3, we see that it is not divisible in ring GF(2)[X] by polynomial X+1, thus a(8) = 0.
%e A268389 For n = 9 ("1001" in binary) which encodes polynomial x^3 + 1, we see that it can be factored over GF(2) as (X+1)(X^2 + X + 1), and thus a(9) = 1.
