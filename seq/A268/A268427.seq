%N A268427 Number of distinct free polyominoes that will fit in a square of size n X n.
%C A268427 A268416 gives the number of polyominoes that fill fit inside an n X n square, but with the restriction that they have their edges aligned with the sides of the square. The current sequence removes that restriction, and hence differs from A268416 at a(5). See link "Explanation of a(5)".
