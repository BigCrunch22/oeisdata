%N A268066 Even numbers coprime to the number of their divisors.
%C A268066 This is a subsequence of A046642 for even numbers that stands out due to the following property (theorem).
%C A268066 Theorem: even numbers coprime to the number of their divisors are square.
%C A268066 Proof: (1) even numbers can be coprime only to odd numbers, (2) a number with an odd number of divisors must be square, (3) to prove (2) let n = p^a*q^b* ... *r^c, where p, q, ..., r are prime and a, b, ..., c positive integers, which gives the number of divisors of n to be (1+a)*(1+b)* ... *(1+c), and if this number is to be odd, all these factors must be odd too, implying a, b, ..., c must be even and thus implying that n must be square.
%C A268066 For n = p_1^e_1 ... p_k^e_k to be a member, where p_j are primes, e_j >= 1 and p_1 = 2, all e_i+1 are coprime to all p_j. - _Robert Israel_, Jan 25 2016

%e A268066 For n = 1, a(1) = 4 belongs to this sequence for the number of divisors of 4, (1,2,4), is 3, which makes it coprime with 4.
