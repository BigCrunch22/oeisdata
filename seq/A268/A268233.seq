%N A268233 Excess of number of 1's over number of 0's in terms 0 through n of A047999.
%C A268233 If n and k are large with 0 <= k <= n, there is a high probability that there will be a position where the binary expansion of n is 0 and that of k is 1. By Lucas's theorem, this means that binomial(n,k) is even, and so A047999 is 0. This implies that A047999 is mostly zeros, and so we expect the present sequence to have slope -1, an observation which is supported by the graph.
%C A268233 In fact the above remark follows from the fact that the Hausdorff dimension of the 1's in the Sierpinski gasket (the limiting form of A047999) is 1.584... - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 12 2016
