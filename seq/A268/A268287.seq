%N A268287 a(n) shows how many times the sum of the hours and minutes is prime in an n-hour period starting from midnight.
%C A268287 Partial sums of the sequence formed by repeating [17, 17, 18, 17, 16, 16, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14, 14]. - _Michel Marcus_, Feb 01 2016
%e A268287 In the first one-hour period, i.e. between 0:00 and 0:59, there are PrimePi(59) - PrimePi[0] = 17 primes, therefore a(1) = 17.
