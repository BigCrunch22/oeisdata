%N A268310 Largest k > 0 such that a base b with 1 < b < c exists such that b^(c-1) == 1 (mod c^k), where c is the n-th composite number, or 0 if no such k exists.
%C A268310 a(n) > 0 iff c is a term of A039769.
%C A268310 a(n) > 1 iff c is a term of A267288. In that case, c can be called a "base-b Wieferich pseudoprime", which first happens for n = 100.
%C A268310 Does an integer constant t exist such that a(n) <= t for all n?

%e A268310 The largest k such that c = 133, i.e. A002808(100), satisfies the congruence b^(c-1) == 1 (mod c^k) for 1 < b < 133 is 2, which happens for b = 68. Since there is no other b with 1 < b < c and c satisfying this congruence for a larger k, a(100) = 2.
