%N A197861 Prime divisor of n which appears the fewest times previously in the sequence, with ties to the smaller prime.
%e A197861 The only prime divisor of 4 is 2, so a(4) = 2.
%e A197861 The prime divisors of 6 are 2 and 3; in the sequence to that point (2,3,2,5), there are two 2's and 1 3, we take the less common one, so a(6) = 3.
%e A197861 The prime divisors of 12 are 2 and 3; these occur equally often in the sequence to that point, so we take the smaller one; a(12)=2.
