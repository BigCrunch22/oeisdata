%N A197008 Decimal expansion of the shortest distance from x axis through (1,2) to y axis.
%C A197008 The Philo line of a point P inside an angle T is the shortest segment that crosses T and passes through P.  Suppose that T is the angle formed by the positive x and y axes and that h>0 and k>0.  Notation:
%C A197008 ...
%C A197008 P=(h,k)
%C A197008 L=the Philo line of P across T
%C A197008 U=x-intercept of L
%C A197008 V=y-intercept of L
%C A197008 d=|UV|
%C A197008 ...
%C A197008 Although Philo lines are not generally Euclidean-constructible, exact expressions for U, V, and d can be found for the angle T under consideration.  Write u(t)=(t,0), let v(t) the corresponding point on the y axis, and let d(t) be the distance between u(t) and v(t). Then d is found by minimizing d(t)^2:
%C A197008   d=w*sqrt(1+(k/h)^(2/3)), where w=(h+(h*k^2))^(1/3).

%C A197008 The cube root of any positive number can be connected to the Philo lines (or Philon lines) for a 90-degree angle. If the equation x^3-2 is represented using Lill's method, it can be shown that the path of the root 2^(1/3) creates the shortest segment (Philo line) from the x axis through (1,2) to the y axis.
