%N A197658 Smallest k such that i^k = i mod n for each i in [0..n-1], or 0 if no such k exists.
%C A197658 a(n) = 0 when n is not squarefree. The reason is obvious when n is a perfect square, cube or higher power. Otherwise, n = (p^r)(q^s), where p is some prime, gcd(p, q) = 1, r > 1, s != r; then when k > floor(log_p(n)), p^k mod n is always a multiple of p^2 and thus p doesn't occur again (e.g., for n = 72, the powers of 2 mod 72 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 56, 40, 8, ... in fact, always multiples of 2^3 past 4).
%C A197658 Fermat's little theorem suggests that a(n) = n when n is prime, since then clearly i^(n - 1) = 1 mod n.
%C A197658 Often, but not always, a(n) = abs(mu(n))(phi(n) + 1), where mu(n) is the MÃ¶bius function and phi(n) is Euler's totient function. This is the case when phi(n) = psi(n), where psi(n) is the reduced totient function (or Carmichael lambda function). Thus when n is squarefree it's not guaranteed that a(n) is a divisor of n.
