%N A197862 Prime divisor of n which appears the fewest times previously in the sequence, with ties to the larger prime.
%C A197862 Up to n = 100, this differs from the greatest prime factor function A006530 only at n = 24, 48, 50, 80, and 98.
%e A197862 The only prime divisor of 4 is 2, so a(4) = 2.
%e A197862 The prime divisors of 6 are 2 and 3; in the sequence to that point (2,3,2,5), there are two 2's and 1 3, we take the less common one, so a(6) = 3.
%e A197862 The prime divisors of 12 are 2 and 3; these occur equally often in the sequence to that point, so we take the larger one; a(12)=3.
