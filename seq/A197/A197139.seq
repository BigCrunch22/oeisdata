%N A197139 Decimal expansion of the shortest distance from the x axis through (3,2) to the line y = x.
%C A197139 The shortest segment from one side of an angle T through a point P inside T is called the Philo line of P in T.  For discussions and guides to related sequences, see A197032, A197008 and A195284.
%C A197139 Any Philo line can be constructed using the intersections of circles and hyperbolas. In this case, the Philo line passes though the two points at which the circle (x - 3/2)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 13/4 and the hyperbola x*y - y^2 = 2 intersect. The circle has segment OP as diameter, where O(0,0) is the origin and P is the point (3,2). The asymptotes of the hyperbola are the x axis and the line y = x. Point P is one of the two points at which the circle and the hyperbola intersect. - _Raul Prisacariu_, Apr 06 2024
