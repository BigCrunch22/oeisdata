%N A197956 Even-index Fibonacci partition triangle read by rows.
%C A197956 These are the entries of a triangle which starts

%C A197956 The numbers d(i,n) in the row with index n are recursively defined for 0 <= n and 0 <= i <= n/2, by d(0,n) = 1 for all n, and d(i,n) = 2d(i-1,n-1) + d(i,n-1) - d(i-1,n-2) for 0 < i < n/2, and d(i,2i) = 3d(i-1,n-1) - d(i-1,n-2).
%C A197956 The numbers d(i,n-1) and d(i,n) form the dimension vector of the Fibonacci modules P(n), these are indecomposable quiver representations of the 3-regular tree with bipartite orientation.
%C A197956 A linear combination of the row n (with coefficients either 1 or of the form 3*2^t) gives a partition of the Fibonacci number f_{2n+2}, see A000045 and A001906.
%C A197956 The sequence A177011 is obtained by reading the rows with even index from the right.
%C A197956 The sequence A177020 is obtained by reading the rows with odd index from the right.
%C A197956 The sequence of the entries in the last column of the triangle, with even row index is recorded as A132262, the sequence of the entries in the last column of the triangle, with odd row index is A110122 (Number of Delannoy paths of length n with no EE's crossing the line y=x)
%C A197956 The sequence A197957 is obtained by taking differences of pairs of numbers in neighboring rows of the triangle.
