%N A086713 A squarefree sequence: define a mapping from the set of strings over the alphabet {0,1,2} by f(0)=01201, f(1)=020121, f(2)=0212021 and f of the concatenation of s and t is the concatenation of f(s) and f(t). Then each of 0, f(0), f(f(0)), ... is an initial substring of the next; their limit is the infinite sequence given above.
%C A086713 f is a "squarefree morphism"; i.e. f(s) is squarefree iff s is squarefree.
%C A086713 For any i>0, f^i(0) has the same number of 0's and 1's and one less 2. The length of f^i(0) is A083066(i) = (4*6^i + 1)/5.
