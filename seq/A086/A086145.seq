%N A086145 Triangle read by rows in which T(n,k) is the least positive integer s such that p divides k^s-1, where p=prime(n) and k ranges from 1 to p-1.
%C A086145 The length of row n is A006093(n).
%C A086145 From _J. H. Conway_, Sep 06 2003: (Start)
%C A086145 "Let's ask for the exact power of some prime p that divides a^K - 1. Then the assertion is that if k is the smallest positive number for which p itself divides a^k - 1 and a^k - 1 is exactly divisible by p^i, then a^K - 1 will be divisible by p precisely when K is a multiple of k and then the exact power of p that divides it will be p^(i+j), where p^j is the exact power of p that divides K/k.
%C A086145 "In other words, the first time you get a multiple of p you can "accidentally" get a higher power than the first, but from then on you can only get more p's by putting them into the exponent.
%C A086145 "Examples: the first time 3^K - 1 is divisible by 11 is at 3^5 - 1, which is divisible precisely by 11^2. So 3^K - 1 will be divisible by 11^(2+j) only when KI is divisible by 5 times 11^j.
%C A086145 "Similarly, 2^1092 - 1 happens to be divisible by just 1093^2, so 2^(1092.1093^j) - 1 will be divisible by just 1093^(2+j)."

%C A086145 This is the prime-indexed rows of A057593. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Jan 19 2006
%C A086145 T(n,k) is the multiplicative order of k (mod prime(n)). Note that each row has many numbers that are the same. These numbers are counted in A174842. [_T. D. Noe_, Apr 01 2010]
