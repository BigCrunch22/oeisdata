%N A086582 First 2^n terms of the self-convolution generates the next 2^n terms of this sequence after the 2^n-th term, for all n>=0, where a(0)=1.
%e A086582 The first 8 terms of the self-convolution of {1,1,1,2,1,2,3,6} gives the next 8 terms: {1,2,3,6,7,10,16,26}; together these form the first 16 terms of this sequence: {1,1,1,2,1,2,3,6, 1,2,3,6,7,10,16,26}.
%Y A086582 The self-convolution is A086583, the 2^n-th terms are given by A086584.
