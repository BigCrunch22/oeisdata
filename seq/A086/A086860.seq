%N A086860 Numbers in A086473 corresponding to the unique product of two numbers having the unique sum of A086533.
%C A086860 Related to Martin Gardner's "Impossible Problem".
%C A086860 a(n) is thus a subsequence of A086473, itself a subsequence of A058080. Consider the mapping f:P->S defined thus: S is the sum of a factor pair (both different from 1) of P, where P is a(n). If S is A086533(n) (a subsequence of A014092), then both f and its inverse are injective (but not onto).
%Y A086860 Cf. A086533.
