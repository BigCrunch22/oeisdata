%N A086194 Number of unrooted steric quartic trees with n (unlabeled) nodes and possessing a centroid; number of n carbon alkanes C(n)H(2n +2) with a centroid when stereoisomers are regarded as different.
%C A086194 The degree of each node is <= 4.
%C A086194 A centroid is a node with less than n/2 nodes in each of the incident subtrees, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. If a centroid exists it is unique.
%C A086194 Regarding stereoisomers as different means that only the alternating group A_4 acts at each node, not the full symmetric group S_4. See A010372 for the analogous sequence when stereoisomers are not counted as different.

%F A086194 Let r(x) = g.f. A(x) for A000625 truncated after the x^n term (x^0 through x^n terms only). Then coefficients of x^(2n) and x^(2n+1) in [r(x)^4 + 8 r(x^3) r(x) + 3 r(x^2)^2]/12 are terms 2n+1 and 2n+2 in current sequence..

%Y A086194 For even n A000628(n) = a(n) + A086200(n/2), for odd n A000628(n) = a(n), since every tree has either a centroid or a bicentroid but not both.
