%N A086742 Start with a(0)=1, then k-th run is 1,2,3,..., a(0) + a(1) + a(2) + ... + a(k-1).
%F A086742 a(0) + a(1) + a(2) + ... + a(r(k)) = A006893(k) where r(k) denotes the index of the end of the k-th run. I.e., the first 4 runs are (1), (1), (1, 2), (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), so the 4th run ends with 5=a(8), so r(4)=8 and a(0) + a(1) + a(2) + ... + a(r(4)) = 1+1+1+2+1+2+3+4+5 = 20 which is A006893(4).
%e A086742 The first 3 runs are (1), (1), (1, 2) and a(0) + a(1) + a(2) + a(3) = 1+1+1+2 = 5, so the 4th run is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and the sequence continues: (1), (1), (1, 2), (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), ...
