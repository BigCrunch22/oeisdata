%N A086982 Numbers n such that 10^n+1 is not squarefree.
%C A086982 This sequence is the union of the collection of sequences formed from the nonzero terms of A086981 * A005408, the odd numbers. First occurrence of consecutive integers in sequence is 406,407,408.
%C A086982 From _Robert Israel_, Feb 13 2017: (Start)
%C A086982 Numbers n such that gcd(n, 10^n + 1) > 1 or n = k m where k is odd and 2 m is the order of 2 modulo a member of A045616.
%C A086982 If n is in the sequence, then so is k*n for any odd k. (End)
