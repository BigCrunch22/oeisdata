%N A086982 Numbers n such that 10^n+1 is not squarefree.
%C A086982 This sequence is the union of the collection of sequences formed from the nonzero terms of A086981 * A005408, the odd numbers. First occurrence of consecutive integers in sequence is 406,407,408.
%C A086982 From _Robert Israel_, Feb 13 2017: (Start)
%C A086982 Numbers n such that gcd(n, 10^n + 1) > 1 or n = k*m where k is odd and 2*m is the order of 10 modulo a member of A045616. [Corrected by _Jianing Song_, Nov 01 2024]
%C A086982 If n is in the sequence, then so is k*n for any odd k. (End)
%C A086982 Numbers of the form k*ord(10,p^2)/2, where k is an odd number and p is a prime such that ord(10,p) is even. Here ord(a,m) is the multiplicative order of a modulo m. Note that if p is not in A045616, then ord(10,p^2) = p*ord(10,p). - _Jianing Song_, Nov 01 2024
