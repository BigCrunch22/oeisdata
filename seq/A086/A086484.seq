%e A086484 For n = 3, k = 1 as 3 = 3^1 is a 1st power (the gcd of the exponents is 1). Hence we look for m such that m + 3 is a (1+1)th power, i.e., a 2nd power. The next 2nd power after 3 is 4 and so m + 3 = 4 so a(n) = m = 4-3 = 1.
%e A086484 For n = 36, k = 2 as 36 = 2^2 * 3^2 is a 2nd power (the gcd of the exponents is 2). Hence we look for m such that m + 36 is a (2+1)th power, i.e., a 3rd power. The next 3rd power after 36 is 64 and so m + 36 = 64 so a(n) = m = 64 - 36 = 28. (End)
