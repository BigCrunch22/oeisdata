%N A086826 Number of nonsplittable links (prime or composite) with n crossings.
%C A086826 A link L is splittable if we can embed a plane in R^3, disjoint from L, that separates one or more components of L from other components of L. Otherwise L is nonsplittable.

%e A086826 a(5)=4 since we have 2 prime knots, as well as the Whitehead link; and the trefoil knot linked with a circle.
%e A086826 a(6)=15 since we have 3 prime knots, as well as 2 composite knots (the square & granny knots); 6 prime links; a chain of four circles simply-intertwined; four circles simply-intertwined in the shape of a "T"; three circles, two doubly-intertwined and two simply-intertwined; and the figure-eight knot linked with a circle.
