%N A086748 Odd numbers m such that when C(2k, k) == 1 (mod m) then k is necessarily even.
%C A086748 From _Jinyuan Wang_, Apr 05 2020: (Start)
%C A086748 All terms are odd, because C(2k, k) is always divisible by 2.
%C A086748 If m is a term, then m*t is also a term for odd numbers t.
%C A086748 Theorem 1: if C(2k, k) == 1 (mod 3) then k is necessarily even. If C(2k, k) == 2 (mod 3) then k is necessarily odd.
%C A086748 Proof: for k < 6 it is correct. We have C(6r, 3r) == C(2r, r) (mod 3) and C(6r+4, 3r+2) == C(2r, r)*C(4, 2) == 0 (mod 3). Suppose k is the least value such that theorem 1 is incorrect, then k must be of the form 3r+1. But C(6r+2, 3r+1) == C(2r, r)*C(2, 1) (mod 3), which means that r is a smaller counterexample, a contradiction!
%C A086748 Theorem 2: if C(2k, k) == 1 or 4 (mod 5) then k is necessarily even. If C(2k, k) == 2 or 3 (mod 5) then k is necessarily odd.
%C A086748 Note that C(10r, 5r) == C(2r, r) (mod 5), C(10r+2, 5r+1) == C(2r, r)*C(2, 1) (mod 5), C(10r+4, 5r+2) == C(2r, r)*C(4, 2) (mod 5), C(10r+6, 5r+3) == C(2r, r)*C(6, 3) (mod 5) and C(10r+8, 5r+4) == C(2r, r)*C(8, 4) (mod 5). The proof is similar to that of theorem 1. (End)
%C A086748 Up to m < 1000, all odd m are either of the form 3*(2t-1) or 5*(2t-1) (as proved by _Jinyuan Wang_) and in the sequence, or not in the sequence because an odd k <= 7412629 exists such that C(2k, k) == 1 (mod m). - _Giovanni Resta_, Apr 05 2020
%C A086748 Numbers m such that A099976(k) = 1 (mod m) has no solutions k. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jul 11 2024
%C A086748 Is this  A005408 \ A007775 ? - _Antti Karttunen_, Jul 11 2024
%C A086748 It is likely that 1001 = 7*11*13 or other products of at least 3 primes > 5 provide counterexamples, but it is difficult to prove. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 13 2024
%e A086748 m = 7 is not a term because C(2k,k) = 1 (mod 7) is solvable by the odd k=17.
%e A086748 m = 11 is not a term because C(2k,k) = 1 (mod 11) is solvable by the odd k=13.
%e A086748 m = 13 is not a term because C(2k,k) = 1 (mod 13) is solvable by the odd k=2383.
%e A086748 m = 23 is not a term because C(2k,k) = 1 (mod 23) is solvable by the odd k=3391. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jul 11 2024
