%N A086200 Number of unrooted steric quartic trees with 2n (unlabeled) nodes and possessing a bicentroid; number of 2n-carbon alkanes C(2n)H(4n +2) with a bicentroid when stereoisomers are regarded as different.
%C A086200 The degree of each node is <= 4.
%C A086200 A bicentroid is an edge which connects two subtrees of exactly m/2 nodes, where m is the number of nodes in the tree. If a bicentroid exists it is unique. Clearly trees with an odd number of nodes cannot have a bicentroid.
%C A086200 Regarding stereoisomers as different means that only the alternating group A_4 acts at each node, not the full symmetric group S_4. See A010373 for the analogous sequence when stereoisomers are not counted as different.

%F A086200 G.f.: replace each term x in g.f. for A000625 by x(x+1)/2. Interpretation: ways to pick 2 specific radicals (order not important) from all n carbon radicals is number of 2n carbon bicentered alkanes (join the two radicals with an edge).
%Y A086200 Cf. A000598, A000602, A010732, A010733, A000625, A000628, A086194.
%Y A086200 For even n A000628(n) = A086194(n) + a(n/2), for odd n A000628(n) = A086194(n), since every tree has either a centroid or a bicentroid but not both.
