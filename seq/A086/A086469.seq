%N A086469 Sum of the distinct (smallest) prime signature divisors of n. In case of two or more divisors with the same prime signature the smallest is considered to evaluate the sum. Let this function be defined as psigma(n).
%C A086469 Define n as a 'psigma perfect number' if psigma(n) = 2n. 18 is a psigma perfect number. The p sigma divisors are 1,2,6,9 and 18 and the sum = 36. Conjecture: 18 is the only psigma perfect number.

%e A086469 a(30) = 1 + 2 + 6 + 30 = 39. The divisors 3, 5, 10 and 15 are not considered for the sum as 3 and 5 have the same prime signature as 2 and also 10 and 15 have the same prime signature as 6.
