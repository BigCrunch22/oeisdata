%N A086135 Numbers n such that n and n+10 are both prime but are non-consecutive; which means that at least one prime is between n and n+10; it is not identical with A023303 because here the terms of A031928 are missing.

%F A086135 Complement of a=A031928 with respect to b=A023303: [b]&[nota]: this and A031928 are disjoint, but A031928 is a proper subset of A023303.
%e A086135 First deviation from A023303 = {3,7,13,19,31,37,43,61,73,79,97,103,127,139,157,..} is due to the absence of 139=A031928(1).
