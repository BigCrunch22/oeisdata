%N A286621 Restricted growth sequence computed for filter-sequence A278221, related to the conjugated prime factorization (see A122111).
%C A286621 When filtering sequences (by equivalence class partitioning), this sequence (with its modestly sized terms) can be used instead of A278221 (which has some huge terms), because for all i, j it holds that: a(i) = a(j) <=> A278221(i) = A278221(j).
%C A286621 For example, for all i, j: a(i) = a(j) => A006530(i) = A006530(j).
%H A286621 Antti Karttunen, <a href="/A286621/b286621.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..10000</a>
%F A286621 Construction: we start with a(1)=1 for A278221(1)=1, and then after, for all n > 1, we use the least so far unused natural number k for a(n) if A278221(n) has not been encountered before, otherwise [whenever A278221(n) = A278221(m), for some m < n], we set a(n) = a(m).
%e A286621 For n=2, A278221(2) = 2, which has not been encountered before, thus we allot for a(2) the least so far unused number, which is 2, thus a(2) = 2.
%e A286621 For n=3, A278221(3) = 4, which has not been encountered before, thus we allot for a(3) the least so far unused number, which is 3, thus a(3) = 3.
%e A286621 For n=4, A278221(4) = 2, which was already encountered as A278221(2), thus we set a(4) = a(2) = 2.
%e A286621 For n=9, A278221(9) = 4, which was already encountered at n=3, thus a(9) = 3.
%e A286621 For n=13, A278221(13) = 64, which has not been encountered before, thus we allot for a(13) the least so far unused number, which is 9, thus a(13) = 9.
%e A286621 For n=194, A278221(194) = 50331648, which has not been encountered before, thus we allot for a(194) the least so far unused number, which is 106, thus a(194) = 106.
%e A286621 For n=388, A278221(388) = 50331648, which was already encountered at n=194, thus a(388) = a(194) = 106.
