%N A286496 Renyi-Ulam liar numbers: for k=1,2,3,... this is the maximum n such that k questions "Is x in subset S of {1,...,n}?" are guaranteed to determine x when at most one answer can be a lie.
%C A286496 Calculated from Andrzej Pelc's complete solution for 1-liar games which gives the minimum number of questions required for a given set {1,...,n}.
%C A286496 Andrzej Pelc's formula for the minimum number of questions required for a given set {1,...,n} is: the least value of q such that f(q)>=n, where f(q)=2^q/(q+1) for even n, and f(q)=(2^q-q+1)/(q+1) for odd n. We use this to generate the sequence of maximum set sizes for each value of q.

%e A286496 a(1) = 1 since 1 question is (vacuously) sufficient to determine x in {1}; a(2) = 1, since 2 questions (with one possible lie) is no better than 1; a(3) >= 2, since we can determine x in {1,2} by asking "Is x in {1}?" three times and majority voting. But a(3) is not >2 because we need 5 questions for {1,2,3}; which implies a(4) = 2 also.
