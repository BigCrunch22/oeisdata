%N A286756 Irregular triangle T(n,k) for 0 <= k < 5n/2: T(n,k) = number of vertices of the cube-connected cycle graph of order n that are at a distance k from a designated vertex.
%C A286756 The cube-connected cycle graph of order n is a vertex transitive graph with n*2^n vertices and degree 3.
%C A286756 The radius of the graph is floor(5n/2)-1 for n<=3 and floor(5n/2)-2 for n>3.
