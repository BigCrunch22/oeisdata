%N A286048 Positions of 1 in A286046; complement of A286047.
%C A286048 Conjecture: 2n - a(n) is in {0,1} for n >= 1.
%C A286048 From _Michel Dekking_, Apr 12 2022: (Start)
%C A286048 Obviously Kimberling's conjecture is equivalent to the property that A286046 is a concatenation of the two 2-blocks 01 and 10. This can be read off immediately from the {A, B, C, D} composition of A286046 given in the comments of that sequence.
%C A286048 But more is true. The first difference sequence (d(n)) = 2,2,3,1,2,3,1,... of (a(n)) is a morphic sequence.
%C A286048 From the representation of A286046 by the decoration A->1010, B->1001, C->101001, D->10, we see that the differences between occurrences of 1's are given by a decoration:
%C A286048       A->22, B->31, C->231, D->2.
%C A286048 This is the same decoration as used for A286047, but with the letters 3 and 1 interchanged. It follows directly that (d(n)) can be obtained as a letter to letter image of a morphic sequence, fixed point of a morphism mu on an alphabet {a,b,c,d,e,f} given by
%C A286048       mu: a->ab, b->cd, c->aed, d->f, e->cd, f->aed,
%C A286048 with the letter-to-letter map
%C A286048     lambda:  a->2, b->2, c->3, d->1, e->3, f->2.
%C A286048 We have (d(n)) = lambda(z), where z is the fixed point z = abcdae... of mu.
