%N A286748 Characteristic sequence of the Beatty sequence, A194028, of sqrt(12).
%C A286748 The positions of 0 are given by A286428, and of 1, by A194028.
%C A286748 3 + a(n) is almost, but not quite, the length of consecutive runs of same-sign numbers in A088137(m) starting at m=1. To be precise, A088137(m) for m>0 is 1, 2, 1, -4, -11, -10, 13, 56, 73, -22, -263, -460, -131, 1118, 2629, 1904,... which has 3 positive numbers, 3 negative numbers, 3 positive, 4 negative, ... giving the sequence 3,3,3,4, 3,3,4, 3,3,3,4, ..., and aside from that first "3" this is an almost perfect match for 3 + a(n) which begins 4,3,3,4, 3,3,4, 3,3,3,4, ... . Aside from that first term, these two sequences first differ at the 97th term, and differ only 23 times more in the first 400 terms. - _Greg Dresden_, Oct 06 2019
