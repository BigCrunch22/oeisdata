%N A286610 Restricted growth sequence computed for Euler totient function phi, A000010.

%e A286610 Construction: we start with a(1)=1 for phi(1)=1 (where phi = A000010), and then after, for all n > 1, whenever the value of phi(n) has not been encountered before, we set a(n) to the least natural number k not already in sequence among a(1) .. a(n-1), otherwise [whenever phi(n) = phi(m), for some m < n], we set a(n) = a(m), i.e., to the same value that was assigned to a(m).
%e A286610 For n=2, phi(2) = 1, which value was already encountered as phi(1), thus we set also a(2) = 1.
%e A286610 For n=3, phi(3) = 2, which has not been encountered before, thus we allot for a(3) the least so far unused number, which is 2, thus a(3) = 2.
%e A286610 For n=4, phi(4) = 2, which was already encountered as at n=3 for the first time, thus we set a(4) = a(3) = 2.
%e A286610 For n=5, phi(5) = 4, which has not been encountered before, thus we allot for a(5) the least so far unused number, which is now 3, thus a(5) = 3.
