%N A286292 The first differences of A286291 (one of the bisections of A064736) appears to consist of runs of 1 followed by singleton 2's; this sequence gives the lengths of these runs.
%C A286292 The steps of 2 occur when the corresponding integer is not in A286291 because it already occurred in A286290 [numbers of the form m(m+1) (m & m+1 not occurring earlier) or (m-1)(m+1) with m occurring earlier]. Accordingly, the present sequence equals first differences of A286290, minus 2. - _M. F. Hasler_, May 23 2017
