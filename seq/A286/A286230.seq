%N A286230 Possible differences between consecutive primes p, q satisfying p! == 1 (mod q).
%C A286230 By Wilson's theorem, p! == 1 (mod p+2) whenever p, p+2 are twin primes, so 2 is a term.
%C A286230 Terms d > 2 correspond to Wilson's pseudo-twin primes, i.e., consecutive primes p, q such that q - p = d and p! == 1 (mod q). The corresponding primes are listed in A286181 and A286208.
%C A286230 As a set, the sequence is the union of {2} and the differences {A286208(n) - A286181(n)}.
%C A286230 A positive integer d belongs to this sequence if A033312(d-1) = (d-1)! - 1 has a prime factor q such that q - A151799(q) = d.
%C A286230 All terms are even.
%C A286230 If it exists, a(5) >= 140.
%Y A286230 Cf. A275111, A286181, A286208.
