%N A286417 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms such that the binary representation of the n-th prime contains the binary representation of a(n).
%C A286417 This sequence is a permutation of the natural numbers.
%C A286417 As for A160855, the scatterplot of this sequence shows (almost) straight lines:
%C A286417 - here those lines are related to the position of a(n) in the n-th prime (in binary representation),
%C A286417 - the scatterplot of the possible values of a(n) as a function of the n-th prime constitutes a network of lines in which the scatterplot of a(n) lies,
%C A286417 - see also the scatterplots in the Links section.
%C A286417 For any n>0, a(n) <= A000040(n); the first known values where equality occurs are a(2) = 3 and a(4) = 7.
%C A286417 The fixed points of the sequence belong to A091020.
%C A286417 The first fixed points are: 1, 5, 6, 31, 32, 50, 81, 1052, 3378.
