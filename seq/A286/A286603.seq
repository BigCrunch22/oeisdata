%N A286603 Restricted growth sequence computed for sigma, A000203.
%C A286603 When filtering sequences (by equivalence class partitioning), this sequence can be used instead of A000203, because for all i, j it holds that: a(i) = a(j) <=> A000203(i) = A000203(j) <=> A286358(i) = A286358(j).
%C A286603 Note that the latter equivalence indicates that this is also the restricted growth sequence of A286358.

%e A286603 Construction: we start with a(1)=1 for sigma(1)=1 (where sigma = A000203), and then after, for all n > 1, whenever the value of sigma(n) has not been encountered before, we set a(n) to the least natural number k not already in sequence among a(1) .. a(n-1), otherwise [whenever sigma(n) = sigma(m), for some m < n], we set a(n) = a(m), i.e., to the same value that was assigned to a(m).
%e A286603 For n=2, sigma(2) = 3, not encountered before, thus we allot for a(2) the least so far unused number, which is 2, thus a(2) = 2.
%e A286603 For n=3, sigma(3) = 4, not encountered before, thus we allot for a(3) the least so far unused number, which is 3, thus a(3) = 3.
%e A286603 For n=4, sigma(4) = 7, not encountered before, thus we allot for a(4) the least so far unused number, which is 4, thus a(4) = 4.
%e A286603 For n=5, sigma(5) = 6, not encountered before, thus we allot for a(5) the least so far unused number, which is 5, thus a(5) = 5.
%e A286603 For n=6, sigma(6) = 12, not encountered before, thus we allot for a(6) the least so far unused number, which is 6, thus a(6) = 6.
%e A286603 And this continues for n=7..10 because also for those n sigma obtains fresh new values, so here a(n) = n up to n = 10.
%e A286603 But then comes n=11, where sigma(11) = 12, a value which was already encountered at n=6 for the first time, thus we set a(11) = a(6) = 6.
