%N A286318 Number of species of connected partial Latin squares of size n.
%C A286318 The size of a partial Latin square (PLS) is the number of filled entries, not the order of the matrix. The species of a PLS are all those PLSs you can get by permuting the rows, columns and symbols, and also by permuting these three roles themselves. Empty rows and columns are ignored. A PLS is connected if its associated graph (entries are vertices and edges show which entries share their row column or symbol) is connected.

%Y A286318 Cf. A286317 (is for the same objects but without the requirement to be connected).
