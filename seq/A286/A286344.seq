%N A286344 Number of (n,1)-polyominoes.
%C A286344 (n,k)-polyominoes are disconnected polyominoes with n visible squares and k transparent squares. Importantly, k must be the least number of transparent squares that need to be converted to visible squares to make all the visible squares connected. Note that a regular polyomino of order n is a (n,0)-polyomino, since all its visible squares are already connected. For more details see the paper by Kamenetsky and Cooke.

%e A286344 We can represent these polyominoes as binary matrices, where 1 means visible square and 0 means transparent square. Note that we need to flip (change to 1) one 0 to make all the 1s connected. This also means that the Manhattan distance between any pair of 1s is at most 2. Here are all such polyominoes for n=3:
