%N A286046 {011->1}-transform of the Thue-Morse word A010060.
%C A286046 From _Michel Dekking_, Apr 12 2022: (Start)
%C A286046 This sequence is a morphic sequence, i.e., the letter-to-letter image of the fixed point of a morphism mu. Here is a proof.
%C A286046 The Thue-Morse sequence x:=A010060 is a concatenation of the four return words A=011010, B=011001, C=01101001, and D=0110, of the word 011 in x. (These are the words occurring in x starting with 011, and having no other occurrences of 011 in them.) By applying the Thue-Morse morphism 0->01,1->10 to the return words one induces the derived morphism
%C A286046       tau: A->AB, B->CD, C->ABD, D->C.
%C A286046 This 4-letter morphism can be reduced to a 3-letter morphism by using that the letters A and B only occur in the pair E:=AB. This gives the morphism
%C A286046     nu: E->ECD, C->ED, D->C.
%C A286046 It appears that nu is nothing else but the ternary Morse morphism from A005679 on the alphabet {E,C,D}.
%C A286046 It is clear that to obtain (a(n)) from x one has to apply the morphism to x written as ABCDABD... given by
%C A286046     A->1010, B->1001, C->101001, D->10,
%C A286046 or to x written as ECDED... by applying the morphism delta given by
%C A286046     E->10101001, C->101001, D->10.
%C A286046 In the paper "Morphic words, Beatty sequences and integer images of the Fibonacci language" delta is called a decoration map. It is well-known that decorated fixed points of morphisms are morphic sequences, and the 'natural' algorithm to achieve this yields a morphism on an alphabet of 8+6+2 = 16 symbols. In this particular case one can reduce the number of symbols to 8, say {a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h}, and obtain the morphism mu
%C A286046        mu: a->ab, b->cd, c->ef, d->gh, e->abc, f->dgh, g->e, h->f.
%C A286046 Let y be the fixed point of mu starting with the letter a. Then (a(n)) = lambda(y), where the letter-to-letter map lambda is defined by
%C A286046       lambda: a->1, b->0, c->1, d->0, e->1, f->0, g->0, h->1.

%e A286046 As a word, A010060 = 0110100110010110100101100..., and replacing each 011 by 1 gives 10101001101001101010100110101...
