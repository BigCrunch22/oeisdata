%N A286030 Irregular triangle T(n,k) read by rows: Let S be a 3-member set of integers {f,g,h} where f >= g >= h >= 0 and f+g+h = n. Let S(n,k) be an irregular triangle composed of all S listed in reverse lexicographic order by row n. Then T(n,k) = n!*Q/(3*f!*g!*h!), where Q is the number of permutations of S(n,k). (See "Comments" and "Examples" for additional explanation.)
%C A286030 See "Example" below for the starting construction of S(n,k) and T(n,k).
%C A286030 To understand S(n,k) and Q, consider example S(5,k), i.e., f+g+h = 5, and S(n,k) are listed in reverse lexicographic order. So S(5,k) = {5,0,0}, {4,1,0}, {3,2,0}, {3,1,1}, {2,2,1} k=1..5, respectively. Q is the number of permutations of S(n,k). So Q=3 when S(n,k) = {5,0,0}, {3,1,1} and {2,2,1}; and Q=6 when S(n,k) = {4,1,0} and {3,2,0}.
%C A286030 In general, by definition: Q=1 when all members of S(n,k) are equal, Q=3 when S(n,k) contains a pair, and Q=6 when none of the members of S(n,k) is equal.
%C A286030 Suppose three equally-matched players are playing a tournament of n games; and for each game there is one winner and two losers. Then S(n,k) is the "overall win record" (where player order does not matter) after n games. Let p be the probability that any S(n,k) occurs after n games. Then p = T(n,k)/3^(n-1). (See also "Example" section.)
%C A286030 Generally, when S(n,k) is a z-member set {f,g,h,i..,y}, then Q is the number of permutations of S(n,k), T(n,k) = n!*Q/(z*f!*g!*h!..*y!) and p = T(n,k)/z^(n-1). So when z=2 we get A008314. (Observation prompted by query from Linda Rogers.)
%C A286030 For triangle T(n,k):
%C A286030 Row sums are 3^(n-1).
%C A286030 Row lengths are A001399(n).
%C A286030 Final terms in each row are A199127(n).
%C A286030 For n >= 3: T(n,2) = 2*n.
%C A286030 For n >= 5: T(n,3) = T(n,4) = A002378(n-1) (oblong numbers).
%C A286030 For n >= 6: T(n,6) = A007531(n).
%C A286030 For n >= 8: T(n,9) = A033487(n-3).

%e A286030 T(4,3) = 6 because n=4 and S(4,3) = {2,2,0}; so Q=3 and 3*4!/(3*2!*2!*0!) = 6. Therefore p = 6/27 = 2/9 that the overall win record = {2,2,0} after playing 4 tournament games.
