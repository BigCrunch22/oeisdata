%N A286261 Numbers whose binary expansion is not a cubefree string.
%C A286261 Cubefree means that there is no substring which is the repetition of three identical nonempty strings, see examples.
%C A286261 If n is in the sequence, any number of the form n*2^k + m with 0 <= m < 2^k is in the sequence, and also any number of the form m*2^k + n with 2^k > n, m >= 0.

%F A286261 a(n) ~ n: the sequence has asymptotic density one.
%e A286261 7 is in the sequence, because 7 = 111[2] contains three consecutive "1"s.
%e A286261 8 is in the sequence, because 8 = 1000[2] contains three consecutive "0"s.
%e A286261 42 is in the sequence, because 42 = 101010[2] contains three consecutive "10"s.
%e A286261 From the comment follows that all numbers of the form 7*2^k, 8*2^k or 42*2^k are in the sequence, for any k >= 0.
%e A286261 All numbers congruent to 7 or congruent to 0 (mod 8) are in the sequence.
%e A286261 All numbers of the form m*2^(k+3) +- n with n < 2^k are in the sequence.
