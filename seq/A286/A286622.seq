%N A286622 Restricted growth sequence computed for filter-sequence A278222, related to 1-runs in the binary representation of n.
%C A286622 When filtering sequences (by equivalence class partitioning), this sequence can be used instead of A278222, because for all i, j it holds that: a(i) = a(j) <=> A278222(i) = A278222(j).
%C A286622 For example, for all i, j: a(i) = a(j) => A000120(i) = A000120(j), and for all i, j: a(i) = a(j) => A001316(i) = A001316(j).
%C A286622 The sequence allots a distinct value for each distinct multiset formed from the lengths of 1-runs in the binary representation of n. See the examples. - _Antti Karttunen_, Jun 04 2017

%e A286622 For n = 0, there are no 1-runs, thus the multiset is empty [], and it is allotted the number 1, thus a(0) = 1.
%e A286622 For n = 1, in binary also "1", there is one 1-run of length 1, thus the multiset is [1], which has not been encountered before, and a new number is allotted for that, thus a(1) = 2.
%e A286622 For n = 2, in binary "10", there is one 1-run of length 1, thus the multiset is [1], which was already encountered at n=1, thus a(2) = a(1) = 2.
%e A286622 For n = 3, in binary "11", there is one 1-run of length 2, thus the multiset is [2], which has not been encountered before, and a new number is allotted for that, thus a(3) = 3.
%e A286622 For n = 4, in binary "100", there is one 1-run of length 1, thus the multiset is [1], which was already encountered at n=1 for the first time, thus a(4) = a(1) = 2.
%e A286622 For n = 5, in binary "101", there are two 1-runs, both of length 1, thus the multiset is [1,1], which has not been encountered before, and a new number is allotted for that, thus a(5) = 4.
