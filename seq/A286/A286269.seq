%N A286269 The smallest weight possible for a cyclic prime vector of order n.
%C A286269 A cyclic prime vector of order n is an array of n distinct primes P = (p_1, p_2, ..., p_n), such that every sum of an odd number of consecutive elements is also prime. Unlike normal prime vectors, here the sums are allowed to span from the end to the start of the array. The weight of the cyclic prime vector is the sum of its elements. For full details see Kamenetsky's paper.

%e A286269 The best solution for n=5 is (5, 7, 17, 13, 11) with a weight of 53. This is a cyclic prime vector because all the generated sums are prime: 5+7+17=29, 7+17+13=37, 17+13+11=41, 13+11+5=29, 11+5+7=23, 5+7+17+13+11=53.
