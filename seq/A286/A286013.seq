%N A286013 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k), n>=1, k>=1, in which column k lists the positive integers starting with k, interleaved with k-1 zeros, and the first element of column k is in row k(k+1)/2.
%C A286013 Conjecture 1: T(n,k) is the largest part of the partition of n into k consecutive parts, if T(n,k) > 0.
%C A286013 Conjecture 2: row sums give A286015.
%C A286013 Trapezoidal interpretation from _Peter Munn_, Jun 18 2017: (Start)
%C A286013 There is one to one correspondence between nonzero T(n,k) and trapezoidal area patterns of n dots on a triangular grid, if we include the limiting cases of triangular patterns, straight lines (k=1) or a single dot (k=n=1). The corresponding pattern has T(n,k) dots in its longest side, k dots in the two adjacent sides and T(n,k)-k+1 dots in the fourth side (where a count of 1 dot may be understood as signifying that side's absence).
%C A286013 Reason: From the definition, for k >= 1, m >= 0, T(A000217(k)+km,k) = k+m, where A000217(k) = k(k+1)/2, the k-th triangular number. First element of column k is T(A000217(k),k) = k: this matches a triangular pattern of A000217(k) dots with 3 sides of k dots. Looking at this pattern as k rows of 1..k dots, extend each row by m dots to create a trapezoidal pattern of A000217(k)+km dots with a longest side of k+m dots and adjacent sides of k dots: this matches T(A000217(k)+km,k) = k+m. As nonzero elements in column k occur at intervals of k, every nonzero T(n,k) has a match. Every trapezoidal pattern can be produced by extending a triangular pattern as described, so they all have a match.
%C A286013 The truth of conjecture 1 follows, since each nonzero T(n,k) = k+m corresponds to a trapezoidal pattern of n dots having k rows with lengths (1+m)..(k+m).
%C A286013 The A270877 sieve is related to this sequence because it eliminates n if it is the sum of consecutive numbers whose largest term has survived the sifting (which may likewise be seen in terms of a trapezoidal dot pattern and its longest side). So the sieve eliminates n if any lesser numbers in A270877 are in row n of this sequence.

%e A286013 In accordance with the conjecture, for n = 15 there are four partitions of 15 into consecutive parts: [15], [8, 7], [6, 5, 4] and [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]. The largest parts are 15, 8, 6, 5, respectively, so the 15th row of the triangle is [15, 8, 6, 0, 5].
