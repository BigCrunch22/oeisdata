%N A286031 Positions of 1 in A285568; complement of A285569.
%C A286031 Conjecture:  a(n)/n -> (1+sqrt(5))/2 = golden ratio (A001622).
%C A286031 Proof of this conjecture: the limit is 1/f0 where f0 is the frequency of 0 in (a(n)). Since the generating morphism of (a(n)) has the same incidence matrix as the generating morphism 0->11, 1->0101 of the sequence A285518, it follows that 1/f0 = phi = golden ratio. - _Michel Dekking_, Feb 22 2021
