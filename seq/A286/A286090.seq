%N A286090 Square matrix m read by antidiagonals. For j <= i, m[i, j] is how often sqrtint(gpf(c)) = j where i^2 <= c < (i+1)^2; for j >= i, m[i, j] is how often sqrtint(p) = i where p is a prime factor of c counted with multiplicity and i^2 <= c < (i+1)^2.
%C A286090 The greatest prime factor (see A006530) of 1 is 1 by convention. The definitions for m[i, j] where j >= i and j <= i give no contradiction for j = i.

%F A286090 for n > 1, m[n, n] = A014085(n).
%e A286090 Let i = 2 and sqrtint(n) = the square root of n rounded down to an integer. The integers c such that i^2 = 2^2 <= c < 3^2 = (i+1)^2 are 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The greatest prime factors h of these terms are 2, 5, 3, 7 and 2 respectively. sqrtint(h) are 1, 2, 1, 2 and 1 respectively. 1 occurs thrice here, 2 occurs twice, giving m[2, 1] = 3 and m[2, 2] = 2.
%e A286090 m[1, 2] = 7 because the prime factorizations of 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 are 2^2, 5, 2*3, 7, 2^3. The prime 2 occurs 6 times and sqrtint(2) = 1. The prime factor 3 occurs once and sqrtint(3) = 1. Therefore m[1, 2] = 6 + 1 = 7. p = 5 and p = 7 each occur once and each have sqrtint(p) = 2. Therefore m[2, 2] = 2 as found earlier.
