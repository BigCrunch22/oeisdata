%N A286750 Positions of 0 in A286749; complement of A286751.
%C A286750 a(n) - a(n-1) is in {1,2,3,4} for n>=2, and a(n)/n -> (7 + sqrt(5))/4.
%C A286750 From _Michel Dekking_, Aug 29 2020: (Start)
%C A286750 There is an explicit expression for the difference sequence Delta a given by Delta a(n) = a(n+1)-a(n).
%C A286750 Claim: the sequence Delta a is the decoration a -> 14, b -> 13 of the Fibonacci word abaababaab......
%C A286750 Proof: recall from A286749 that A286749 is the letter-to-letter image of the fixed point x of the morphism mu given by
%C A286750       mu:  1->12341, 2->1, 3->2, 4->34,
%C A286750 where the letter-to-letter map lambda is defined by
%C A286750        lambda:  1->1, 2->1, 3->0, 4->0.
%C A286750 We see from this that 0's in A286749 correspond uniquely to pairs 34 in x. So we compute the return words of 34. These are 3412 and 34112. Since
%C A286750       mu(3412) = 234123411,  mu(34112) = 23412341123411,
%C A286750 the return words, coded as A = 3412, B = 34112 induce a descendant morphism
%C A286750       A->AB, B->ABB.
%C A286750 This well-known morphism (see A096270) has the property that its unique fixed point is the Fibonacci word (on the alphabet {B,A}), preceded by the letter A.
%C A286750 The return word 3412 has lambda-image 0011, and the return word 34112 has lambda-image 00111. This means that they give distances 1 and 3, respectively 1 and 4 between (successive) occurrences of 0's in A286749.
%C A286750 This leads to the decoration A->13, B->14.
%C A286750 That a(n)/n -> (7 + sqrt(5))/4 follows from the corresponding result for the sequence A286751.
