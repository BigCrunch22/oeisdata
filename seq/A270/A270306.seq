%N A270306 Smallest number which is representable as a sum of n but no fewer consecutive nonnegative integers, or 0 for n > 1 if no such number exists.

%F A270306 a(A111774(n)) = 0.
%F A270306 a(A174090(n)) = A163172(n).
%e A270306 a(2) = 1 = 0 + 1 (two but no fewer terms)
%e A270306 a(3) = 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 (three but no fewer terms)
%e A270306 a(4) = 10 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 (four but no fewer terms)
%e A270306 a(5) = 20 = 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 (five but no fewer terms)
%e A270306 a(6) = 0, since no number needs six but no fewer terms
%e A270306 a(7) = 28 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 (seven but no fewer terms)
