%N A270384 Primes p such that (3/4)(p + 1) - 1 is also prime.
%C A270384 Set q = (3/4)(p + 1) - 1, then (q + 1)/(p + 1) = 3/4. If this sequence is proved to be infinite, that would prove two specific cases of the Schinzel-Sierpi≈Ñski conjecture regarding rational numbers.
%C A270384 In fact this sequence is infinite under ('merely') Dickson's conjecture, as it requires infinitely many n with 3n + 2 and 4n + 3 both prime. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Apr 01 2016

%e A270384 3 is in the sequence because 3/4 * 4 - 1 = 2, which is also prime.
%e A270384 7 is in the sequence because 3/4 * 8 - 1 = 5, which is also prime.
%e A270384 11 is not in the sequence because 3/4 * 12 - 1 = 8 = 2^3.
