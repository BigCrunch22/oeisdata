%N A270264 The cumulative sum of the digits of successive terms reproduces the prime number sequence; this is the lexicographically earliest sequence with this property.
%C A270264 Add the digits of (say) the first 4 terms of the sequence: you'll get 7 and 7 is the 4th prime number.
%C A270264 Add the digits of the first 5 terms of the sequence: you'll get 11 and 11 is the 5th prime number.
%C A270264 Add the digits of the first 6 terms of the sequence: you'll get 13 and 13 is the 6th prime number. Etc.
%C A270264 Presumably this is a permutation of the numbers {1} union A054683 (cf. A269740). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 15 2016
%C A270264 The conjecture that the sequence is equal to {1} union A054683 is equivalent to Polignac's conjecture (a generalization of the twin prime conjecture) which is still open. - _Chai Wah Wu_, Mar 15 2016
