%N A270304 Numbers that equal the sum of the squares of the digits of their own square in base 15.
%C A270304 In base 14: 0, 1 only.
%C A270304 There are no further terms below 400000. - _Harvey P. Dale_, Sep 02 2021
%C A270304 This list is complete.  Consider n, a 4 digit number in base 15.  Clearly, n>=15^3=3375.  Also, n^2 has no more than 8 digits base 15, and no digit is larger than 14, so the sum of the squares of the digits of n^2 is <= 2*4*14^2=1568, allowing no solutions.  As n increases exponentially in the number of digits and the sum increases linearly, there are no solutions greater than 3375. - _Gus Michel_, Oct 04 2024
