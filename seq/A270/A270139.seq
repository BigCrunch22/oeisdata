%N A270139 a(n)=n when n<=3, otherwise a(n) is the smallest unused positive integer which is not coprime to the two previous terms.
%C A270139 Other possible conditions on a(n) with respect to its common factors with a(n-2) and a(n-1) lead to the following:
%C A270139 Coprime to both: A084937.
%C A270139 Coprime to the latter and not the former: A098550.
%C A270139 Coprime to the former and not the latter: with any initial conditions, the sequence "paints itself into a corner", i.e., is finite. With the added condition of a(n) having an extra prime factor not contained in a(n-1), it is A336957.
%C A270139 Coprime to the latter, regardless of the former: simply A000027.
%C A270139 Coprime to the former, regardless of the latter: A121216.
%C A270139 Non-coprime to the latter, regardless of the former: A064413.
%C A270139 Non-coprime to the former, regardless of the latter: A121217.

%e A270139 a(12) = 30, a(13) = 35, so a(14) must have common factors (possibly different) with 30 and 35, and the smallest unused number with that property turns out to be 14, so a(14) = 14.
