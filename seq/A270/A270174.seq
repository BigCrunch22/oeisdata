%N A270174 a(n) is the number of different ways to seat a set of n married male-female couples at a straight table so that men and women alternate and every man is separated by at least two men from his wife.
%C A270174 We assume that the chairs are uniform and indistinguishable.
%C A270174 First we arrange the women in alternating seats, in 2*n! ways. Second, we find the number, G_{n} say, of ways of arranging men in the remaining seats such that every husband cannot sit at the left or right next 1, 2, ..., h male's seats from his wife. Note that here h = 2. We give the board B4, where X denotes the seat cannot be set at, where there are h X's in first column, and h+1 X's in first row, ..., 2h X's in the h column, ..., other entries are 1's. Thus the number of different ways to seat a set of n married male-female couples at a straight table is a_{n}=2*n!*G_{n}.
