%N A270074 Select a pair of successive terms a and b; switch the two digits in contact with the comma between a and b; the new pair is now made of prime numbers. By decree no term is repeated in the sequence and all terms are nonprime numbers. This sequence is the lexicographically first with those properties.
%C A270074 Numbers that are composite for all last digits 1..9 cannot be part of the sequence, e.g., 201..209, 321..329. (Cf. A078492)

%e A270074 The first pair of nonprime numbers is 1,21. After we switch the digits of 1,21 we get 2,11 (which are indeed both prime numbers). The second pair 21,33 (both nonprime numbers) becomes 23,13 (prime numbers). The third pair 33,77 (both nonprime numbers) becomes 37,37 (prime numbers), etc.
