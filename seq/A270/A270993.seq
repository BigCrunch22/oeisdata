%N A270993 Values of A076336(n) such that A076336(n) = A076336(n+1) - 14.
%C A270993 See A270971 for the motivation behind this sequence.
%C A270993 Riesel showed that there are infinitely many integers such that k*(2^m) - 1 is not prime for any integer m. He showed that the number 509203 has this property, as does 509203 plus any positive integer multiple of 11184810.
%C A270993 In this sequence, the lesser of (provable) Sierpiński pairs appears with the linear formula a(n) = 7523267 + 11184810*(n-1).
%C A270993 Since 7523267 is a term of A244561, for every integer k > 0, 7523267*2^k+1 has a divisor in the set {3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 241}. Because 11184810 = 2*3*5*7*13*17*241, a(n)*2^k+1 = 7523267*2^k+1 + 11184810*(n-1)*2^k+1 always has a divisor in the set {3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 241}. Since a(n) is always odd because of its definition, a(n) is a Sierpiński number. Additionally, 7523267 + 14 = 7523281 is also a term of A244561. So a(n) + 14 is a Sierpiński number too, with the same proof.
%C A270993 In conclusion, if the minimum difference between consecutive (provable) Sierpiński numbers is 14 (see comment section of A270971 for the reason behind this claim), a(n) and a(n) + 14 must be consecutive and a(n) = 7523267 + 11184810*(n-1) is the formula for this sequence.
%e A270993 7523267 is a term because 7523267 and 7523267 + 14 = 7523281 are consecutive (provable) Sierpiński numbers.
