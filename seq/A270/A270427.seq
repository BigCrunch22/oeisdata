%N A270427 Numbers k such that k*floor(2^k/k) + 1 is prime.
%C A270427 Numbers j such that 2^j - (2^j mod j) + 1 is prime.
%C A270427 The associated primes are 2^1+1, 2^2+1, 2^3-1, 2^4+1, 2^5-1, 2^6-3, 2^7-1, 2^8+1, 2^10-3, 2^12-3, 2^13-1, 2^14-3, 2^16+1, 2^17-1, 2^19-1, ...
%C A270427 Are there composite numbers h such that 2^h - (2^(h-1) mod h) is prime?
%C A270427 An odd prime p is in the sequence if and only if 2^p - 1 is prime. Also r = 2^t is a term if and only if 2^r + 1 is an odd prime. So these numbers give all Mersenne primes > 3 and all Fermat primes. Besides, they probably give infinitely many other primes; for example, all primes of the form 4^p - 3 with p prime: 2*p is in the sequence if and only if p is in A058253.
%C A270427 No Fermat pseudoprimes (odd and even) to base 2 in the sequence.
%C A270427 It seems that there are no odd prime powers p^s with s > 1 in the sequence.
