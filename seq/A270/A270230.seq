%N A270230 Decimal expansion of 3/(4*Pi).
%C A270230 Consider generic prisms with triangular bases (tp), enclosed by a sphere, and let f(tp) be the fraction of the sphere volume occupied by any of them (i.e., the ratio of the prism volume to the sphere volume). Then this constant is the supremum of f(tp). It is attained by prisms which have as their base equilateral triangles with edge lengths r*sqrt(2), and rectangular side faces that are r*sqrt(2) wide and r*2/sqrt(3) high, where r is the radius of the enclosing, circumscribed sphere.
%C A270230 An intriguing fact is that the volume of such a best-fitting prism is exactly r^3. Hence, 1/a is the volume of a sphere with radius 1.
%C A270230 Examples of similar constants obtained for other shapes enclosed by spheres are: A020760 for cylinders and A165952 for cuboids.
