%N A294737 Numbers that are the sum of 5 nonzero squares in exactly 3 ways.
%C A294737 This sequence is likely finite and complete as the next term, if it exists, is > 50000.
%C A294737 From a proof by _David A. Corneth_ on Nov 08 2017 in A294736: This sequence is complete, see the von Eitzen Link and Price's computation that the next term must be > 50000. Proof. The link mentions "for positive integer n, if n > 5408 then the number of ways to write n as a sum of 5 squares is at least Floor(Sqrt(n - 101) / 8)". So for n > 5408, there are more than eight ways to write n as a sum of 5 squares. For n <= 5408, it has been verified if n is in the sequence by inspection. Hence the sequence is complete.
