%N A294472 Squarefree numbers whose odd prime factors are all consecutive primes.
%C A294472 The union of products of any number of consecutive odd primes and twice products of any number of consecutive odd primes.
%C A294472 A073485 lists the squarefree numbers with no gaps in their prime factors >= prime(1), and {a(n)} lists the squarefree numbers with no gaps in their prime factors >= prime(2). If we let {b(n)} be the squarefree numbers with no gaps in their prime factors >= prime(3), ..., and let {x(n)} be the squarefree numbers with no gaps in their prime factors >= prime(y), ..., then A073485(n) >= a(n) >= b(n) >= ... >= x(n) >= ... >= A005117(n).

%C A294472 Conjecture: if z(n) is the smallest y such that n*k - k^2 is a squarefree number with no gaps in their prime factors >= prime(y) for some k < n, then z(n) >= 1 for all n > 1.
%C A294472 The terms a(n) for which a(n-1) + 1 = a(n) = a(n+1) - 1 begin 2, 6, 14, 30, 106, ... [corrected by _Jon E. Schoenfield_, May 26 2018]
%C A294472 Squarefree numbers for which any two neighboring odd prime factors in the ordered list of prime factors are consecutive primes. - _Felix Fr√∂hlich_, Nov 01 2017
%e A294472 70 is in this sequence because 2*5*7 = 70 is a squarefree number with two consecutive odd prime factors, 5 and 7.
