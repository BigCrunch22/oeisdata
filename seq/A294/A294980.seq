%N A294980 a(n) is the total number of elements after n-th stage in a hybrid cellular automaton formed by Y-toothpicks and V-toothpicks (see Comments lines for precise definition).
%C A294980 We are on the infinite triangular grid.
%C A294980 At stage 0 there are no elements in the structure, so a(0) = 0.
%C A294980 If n is odd at n-th stage we add Y-toothpicks to the structure.
%C A294980 If n is a positive even number at n-th stage we add V-toothpicks to the structure.
%C A294980 a(n) is the total number of Y-toothpicks and V-toothpicks after n-th stages.
%C A294980 A294981(n) gives the number of elements added to the structure at n-th stage.
%C A294980 The "word" of this cellular automaton is "ab". For further information about the word of cellular automata see A296612. - _Omar E. Pol_, Mar 05 2019
