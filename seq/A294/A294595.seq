%N A294595 Numbers that are the sum of three squares (square 0 allowed) in exactly six ways.
%C A294595 These are the numbers for which A000164(a(n)) = 6.
%C A294595 a(n) is the n-th largest number which has a representation as a sum of three integer squares (square 0 allowed), in exactly six ways, if neither the order of terms nor the signs of the numbers to be squared are taken into account. The multiplicity of a(n) with order and signs taken into account is A005875(a(n)).
%C A294595 This sequence is a proper subsequence of A000378.
