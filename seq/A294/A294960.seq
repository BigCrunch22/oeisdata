%N A294960 Snowflake (or E-toothpick) sequence of the second kind (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A294960 This has essentially the same rules as the snowflake sequence A161330, but here there is an additional rule: there are no E-toothpicks of the same generation that share the endpoint of two parallel components.
%C A294960 The structure is lighter than the structure of A161330 from which differs at a(7).
%C A294960 Note that, on the infinite triangular grid, an E-toothpick can be represented as a polyedge with three components. In this case, at the n-th round, the structure is a polyedge with 3*a(n) components.
%C A294960 An E-toothpick looks like a bird's footprint (or more generally a dinosaur's footprint).
%C A294960 a(n) gives the number of E-toothpicks in the structure after n rounds.
%C A294960 A294961(n) is the number of E-toothpicks added at the n-th round, n >= 1. - _Omar E. Pol_, Apr 15 2018
