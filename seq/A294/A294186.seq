%N A294186 Number of distinct greater twin primes which are in Goldbach partitions of 2n.
%C A294186 Tomas Oliveira e Silva in 2012 experimentally confirmed that all even numbers <= 4*10^18 have at least one Goldbach partition (GP) with a prime 9781 or less. Detailed examination of all even numbers < 10^6 showed that the most popular prime in all GPs is 3 (78497 occurrences), then 5 (70328), then 7 (62185), then 11 (48582), then 13 (40916), then 17 (31091), then 19 (29791) - all these primes are twin primes. These results gave rise to a hypothesis that twin primes should be rather frequent in GP, especially those relatively small.
%C A294186 Further empirical experiments demonstrated, surprisingly, there are in general two categories of even numbers n: category 1 - with 0, 1, or 2 distinct greater twin primes in all GPs(n), and category 2 - with fast increasing number of distinct greater twin primes in GPs(n).

%e A294186 a(5)=2 because 2*5=10 has two ordered Goldbach partitions: 3+7 and 5+5. 5 is a greater twin prime (because 3 and 5 are twin primes), 7 is a greater twin prime (because 5 and 7 are twin primes).
