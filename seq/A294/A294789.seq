%N A294789 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k), n>=2, 1 <= k <= n-1, is the number of permutations in S_n in which there are k different values for the values mod n of the differences between adjacent elements when written in row notation.
%C A294789 Take a permutation perm on the numbers 1 through n, think of it as a sequence: perm = (x1, x2, ... xn) where each of the x's is a number between 1 and n.
%C A294789 Now take the sequence of differences, read cyclically: Diff(perm) = (x2 - x1, x3 - x2, ... xn - x(n-1), x1 - xn) but take the differences mod n, so that we have no negative numbers, only numbers between 1 and n-1.
%C A294789 Now consider Diff(perm) as a set, ignoring repetitions, and count how many different elements there are in it. Let that be called D(perm).
%C A294789 Among the n! different permutations on n elements, T(n,k) is the number with D(perm) = k.

%e A294789 For n=2 there are two permutations: {1,2} and {2,1} in each case there is but 1 difference, namely 1. This gives the first value of the sequence T(2,1)=2.
%e A294789 For n=3 there are six permutations and once again the only difference between successive member of the permutation is one. There are no successive members whose difference is two. This gives T(3,1)=6, T(3,2)=0.
