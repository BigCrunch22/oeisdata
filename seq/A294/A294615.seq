%N A294615 a(n) is the smallest prime p such that there is a multiplicative subgroup H of Z/pZ, of odd order and of index 2n, such that for any two cosets H1 and H2 of H, H1 + H2 contains all of (Z/pZ)\0, except that H+H contains all of (Z/pZ)\0 except -H. If no such prime exists, a(n) = 0.
%C A294615 The fact that H is of odd order means H is disjoint from -H. The finite integral relation algebra with n pairs of asymmetric diversity atoms a_i, where the forbidden cycles are of the form (a_i, a_i, a_i^(converse)), is representable over Z/pZ, where p = a(n). These are "directed anti-Ramsey algebras", since "monochromatic intransitive triangles" are forbidden.
