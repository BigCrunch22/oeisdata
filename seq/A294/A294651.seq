%N A294651 Least possible value for the highest denominator in the decomposition of unity as a sum of different unitary fractions the greatest of which is 1/n.
%C A294651 The decompositions need not be unique. E.g., for a(7) either 1/12 or 1/20 + 1/30 may be used in the decomposition indifferently.
%C A294651 For prime numbers p and any fixed epsilon < 1, a(p) > epsilon*p*log(p) for all sufficiently large p.
%H A294651 Jon E. Schoenfield, <a href="/A294651/a294651_4.txt">All unitary decompositions (listed in lexicographic order) for n = 1..30</a>. (Decompositions up to n = 18 originally found by J. Múgica.)

%e A294651 1 = 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/10 + 1/12 + 1/15, and there is no such decomposition starting at 1/3 and having a greatest denominator smaller than 15, so a(3)=15.
%Y A294651 Cf. A192881, which looks at decompositions with the least possible number of terms. Those from this sequence achieve those bounds up to a(7), with exception of a(3). However, n=7 is likely the last value of n for which this holds.
%Y A294651 Cf. A272083.
