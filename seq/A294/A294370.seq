%N A294370 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive numbers such that, for any n > 0, a(2*n) = 3*a(n).
%C A294370 This sequence can be generalized easily: for any i > 1 and j > 1 such that gcd(i, j)=1:
%C A294370 - let f_i_j be the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive numbers such that, for any n > 0, f_i_j(i*n) = j*f_i_j(n),
%C A294370 - in particular, f_2_3 = a (this sequence),
%C A294370 - if n is the k-th positive number not divisible by i and m the k-th positive number not divisible by j, then f_i_j(n) = m, and for any x >= 0, f_i_j(n*i^x) = m*j^x,
%C A294370 - a(n) is divisible by j^x iff n is divisible by i^x,
%C A294370 - f_i_j is a permutation of the natural numbers, with inverse f_j_i,
%C A294370 - f_i_j(1) = 1.
%C A294370 See A294371 for the inverse of this sequence.
%C A294370 Apparently, a(1) = 1 and a(6) = 6 are the only fixed points of this sequence.

%F A294370 a(A005408(i)*2^j) = A001651(i)*3^j for any i > 0 and j >= 0.
%e A294370 a(1) = 1 is suitable, and a(2^i) = 3^i for any i >= 0.
%e A294370 a(2) = 3 * a(1) = 3.
%e A294370 a(3) = 2 is suitable, and a(3*2^i) = 2*3^i for any i >= 0.
%e A294370 a(4) = 3 * a(2) = 9.
%e A294370 a(5) = 4 is suitable, and a(5*2^i) = 4*3^i for any i >= 0.
