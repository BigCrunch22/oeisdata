%N A294736 Numbers that are the sum of 5 nonzero squares in exactly 2 ways.
%C A294736 Inspected values of n <= 50000.
%C A294736 This sequence is complete, see the von Eitzen Link and Price's computation that the next term must be > 50000. Proof. The link mentions "for positive integer n, if n > 5408 then the number of ways to write n as a sum of 5 squares is at least Floor(Sqrt(n - 101) / 8)". So for n > 5408, there are more than two ways to write n as a sum of 5 squares. For n <= 5408, it has been verified if n is in the sequence by inspection. Hence the sequence is complete." - _David A.

%e A294736 There are exactly two ways 20 is a sum of 5 nonzero squares. These are 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 4^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 20. Therefore 20 is in the sequence.
