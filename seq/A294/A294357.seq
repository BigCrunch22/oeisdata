%N A294357 Smallest odd number that can be expressed in more ways by sums of 3 odd primes p+q+r with p <= q <= r than any smaller odd number.
%C A294357 Position of n-th record in A007963 converted to actual odd number for which the record is achieved.
%C A294357 The corresponding records of numbers of representations are provided in A294358.
%C A294357 Empirically mod(a(n),6) = 5 for all a(n) > 63 and mod(a(n),30) != 5 for all a(n) > 425.

%F A294357 a(1)=9 because 9 = 3+3+3 is the smallest number that can be represented as sum of 3 odd primes.
%F A294357 a(13)=51 because A007963(25) = A007963((51-1)/2) = 14 is the 13th record in A007963.
