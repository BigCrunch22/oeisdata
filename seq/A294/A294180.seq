%N A294180 The 3-symbol Pell word.
%C A294180 In the Pell word A171588 = 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, ..., group the letters in overlapping blocks of length two: [0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],... Then code [0,0]->1, [0,1]->2, [1,0]->3. This gives (a(n)).
%C A294180 (a(n)) is the unique fixed point of the 3-symbol Pell morphism
%C A294180     1 -> 123, 2 ->123, 3 -> 1.
%C A294180 The morphism and the fixed point are in standard form.
%C A294180 Modulo a change of alphabet (1->0, 2->1, 3->2), this sequence is equal to A263844.
%C A294180 From _Michel Dekking_, Feb 23 2018: (Start)
%C A294180 The positions of 1 in (a(n)) are given by
%C A294180   A188376 = 1,4,7,8,11,14,15,18,...
%C A294180 Why is this true? First, the Pell word b is given by
%C A294180     b(n) = [(n+1)(1-r)]-[n(1-r)], where r =1/sqrt(2).
%C A294180 This can rewritten as
%C A294180     b(n) = [nr]-[(n+1)r]+1.
%C A294180 Second,
%C A294180     1 occurs at n in (a(n))  <=>
%C A294180     00 occurs at n in (b(n)) <=>
%C A294180     b(n)+b(n+1) = 0          <=>
%C A294180     [nr]-[(n+2)r]+2 = 0      <=>
%C A294180     [(n+2)r]-[nr]-1 = 1      <=>
%C A294180     1 occurs at n in A188374.
%C A294180 The positions of 2 in (a(n)) are given by A001952 - 1 = 2,5,9,12,16,..., since 2 occurs at n in (a(n)) if and only if 3 occurs at n+1 in (a(n)).
%C A294180 The positions of 3 in (a(n)) are given by A001952 = 3,6,10,13,17,..., since 3 occurs at n in (a(n)) if and only if 1 occurs at n in (b(n)).
%C A294180 The sequence of positions of 3 in (a(n)) is equal to the sequence b in Carlitz et al. The sequence of positions of 1 in (a(n)) seems to be equal to the sequence ad' in Carlitz et al. (End)
%C A294180 See the comments of A188376 for a proof of the observation on the positions of 1 in (a(n)). - _Michel Dekking_, Feb 27 2018
