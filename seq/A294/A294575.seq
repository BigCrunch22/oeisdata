%N A294575 Numbers n such that 2 * A243823(n) > n.
%C A294575 Consider A243823(n), which is the number of m < n that are products of at least one prime p | n and at least one prime q that does not divide n. These numbers m in the cototient of n do not divide a power of n. This sequence lists numbers n where such numbers m are predominant.

%e A294575 A272619(10) = (6), A243823(10) = 1, so 10 is not in the sequence. A243823(144) = 74, which is greater than half of all numbers less than or equal to 144, thus 144 is the first term.
