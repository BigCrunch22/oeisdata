%N A294676 Ramsey-Comer numbers: a(n) is the smallest prime p congruent to 1 mod 2n such that for every prime q >= p (also congruent to 1 mod 2n), the multiplicative subgroup H of (Z/qZ)* of index n contains a solution to x+y = z.
%C A294676 a(n) <= n^4 + 5 (cf. Alm, 2017).
%C A294676 The subgroup H, along with its n-1 cosets, induces a cyclic coloring on K_q. Labeling the vertices 0 through q-1, color the edge uv by the color corresponding to the coset containing u-v (mod q). Thus if q >= a(n), the coloring induced by H and its cosets must contain a monochromatic triangle. In fact, it contains many monochromatic triangles in each color class.
%C A294676 The data gathered thus far suggest that the bound n^4 + 5 can be replaced by cn^3 for some c > 1, but there is no proof.
%C A294676 a(n) > A263308(n). The reason A263308(8) is zero can be taken to be that a(8) is exceptionally small; similarly, a(13) is small, so A263308(13)=0.
