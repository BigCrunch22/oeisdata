%N A294660 Least nonnegative integer not occurring earlier whose square has no digit in common with the square of the previous term, a(0) = 0.
%C A294660 This is not a permutation of the nonnegative integers, since numbers whose square has all digits '1' through '9' (cf. A294661, e.g., 11826 with 11826^2 = 139854276) can never appear - and these numbers have asymptotic density 1.
%C A294660 Will all integers whose square does not have all of the digits 1-9, eventually appear? Or might the sequence be finite? Since a(n)^2 has no digits in common with a(n-1)^2, it is sufficient for a(n+1) to exist, to find a number whose square has a subset of the digits of a(n-1)^2. Is this always possible? This problem sometimes has only "sporadic k-digital solutions", see, e.g., A058430, A030175, ... and the link to De Geest's page.

%e A294660 Since a(7)^2 = 7^2 = 49, the subsequent term cannot be 8, since 8^2 = 64 has the digit 4 in common with 49. Therefore, a(8) = 9, with 9^2 = 81 having no common digit with 49.
%e A294660 a(1201) = 1037. So the square of the next term must not have any of the digits in {0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9}, only 2, 4, 8 are allowed. The least such number that has not been used before is a(1202) = 210912978, with a(1202)^2 = 210912978^2 = 44484284288828484. - _Alois P. Heinz_, Nov 09 2017
