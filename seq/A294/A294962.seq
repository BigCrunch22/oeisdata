%N A294962 a(n) is the total number of elements after n-th stage of a hybrid (and finite) cellular automaton formed by toothpicks, D-toothpicks and T-toothpicks on the infinite square grid (see Comments lines for precise definition).
%C A294962 It seems that this cellular automaton resembles the synthesis of a molecule, a protein, etc.
%C A294962 After 10th stage there are no exposed endpoints in the structure, so the structure is finished.
%C A294962 A294963(n) gives the number of elements added to the structure at n-th stage.
