%N A294713 Numbers that are the sum of three squares (square 0 allowed) in exactly ten ways.
%C A294713 These are the numbers for which A000164(a(n)) = 10.
%C A294713 a(n) is the n-th largest number which has a representation as a sum of three integer squares (square 0 allowed), in exactly ten ways, if neither the order of terms nor the signs of the numbers to be squared are taken into account. The multiplicity of a(n) with order and signs taken into account is A005875(a(n)).
%C A294713 This sequence is a proper subsequence of A000378.
