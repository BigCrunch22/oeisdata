%N A294448 Discrepancy of the Kolakoski sequence A000002.
%C A294448 The discrepancy is defined by a(n) = Sum_{i=1..n} (-1)^k(i), where k(i) = A000002(i). The negative of this sequence is already in the OEIS (A088568), but does not seem to be found if one looks up -1, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0, -1, 0, 1, 0, 1, ..., so this version has been added for completeness.
%C A294448 See A088568 for more information and references.
