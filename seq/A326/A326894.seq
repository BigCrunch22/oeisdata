%N A326894 a(1) = 1; thereafter, a(n) is the reversal of the next prime after a(n - 1) in base 3 if n is prime, and the reversal of the next composite after a(n - 1) in base 3 if n is composite.
%C A326894 The sequence is written in base 10.
%C A326894 _RÃ©my Sigrist_'s argument from A326344 gives an upper bound of 23, although the true maximum value is 20, as confirmed by _Andrew Weimholt_'s argument from A326344.

%e A326894 By definition, a(1) = 1. The next composite after a(3) = 1 is 4, or 11 in base 3. Reversed this is still 11 in base 3, or 4 in base 10. Thus a(4) = 4 since 4 is composite.
