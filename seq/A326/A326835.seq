%N A326835 Numbers whose divisors have distinct values of the Euler totient function (A000010).
%C A326835 Since Sum_{d|k} phi(d) = k, these are numbers k such that the set {phi(d) | d|k} is a partition of k into distinct parts.
%C A326835 Includes all the odd prime numbers, since an odd prime p has 2 divisors, 1 and p, whose phi values are 1 and p-1.
%C A326835 If k is a term, then all the divisors of k are also terms. If k is not a term, then all its multiples are not terms. The primitive terms of the complementary sequence are 2, 63, 273, 513, 585, 825, 2107, 2109, 2255, 3069, ....
%C A326835 In particular, all the terms are odd since 2 is not a term (phi(1) = phi(2)).
%C A326835 The number of terms below 10^k for k = 1, 2, ... are 5, 49, 488, 4860, 48598, 485807, 4857394, 48572251, 485716764, 4857144075, ...
%C A326835 Apparently the sequence has an asymptotic density of 0.4857...

%F A326835 Numbers k such that A319696(k) = A000005(k).
%F A326835 Numbers k such that A319695(k) = A032741(k).
%F A326835 Numbers k such that the k-th row of A102190 has distinct terms.
%e A326835 3 is a term since it has 2 divisors, 1 and 3, and phi(1) = 1 != phi(3) = 2.
%e A326835 15 is a term since the phi values of its divisors, {1, 3, 5, 15}, are distinct: {1, 2, 4, 8}.
