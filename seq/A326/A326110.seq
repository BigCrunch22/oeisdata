%e A326110 The sequence starts with 1, 1111, 10111, 11011, 1117,... and we see indeed that a(2) = 1111 is the smallest available integer showing four digits that divide a(1) = 1; in the same manner we have a(3) = 10111 [the four 1s divide a(2) = 1111], a(4) = 11011 [the four 1s divide a(3) = 10111], a(5) = 1117 [all four digits divide 11011], etc.
%Y A326110 Cf. A326106 [a(n) is not divisible by any digit of a(n+1)], A326107 [a(n) is divisible by one and only one digit of a(n+1)], A326108  [a(n) is divisible by two and only two digits of a(n+1)] and A326109 [a(n) is divisible by three and only three digits of a(n+1)].
