%N A326108 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct terms such that a(n) is divisible by two and only two digits of a(n+1).
%C A326108 The first term that does not show any digit 1 is a(20) = 33.

%e A326108 The sequence starts with 1, 11, 101, 110, 12, 13, 112, 14,... and we see indeed that a(2) = 11 is the smallest available integer showing two digits that divide a(1) = 1; in the same manner we have a(3) = 101 and a(4) = 110; a(5) = 12 because 12 is the smallest available integer that has two digits dividing a(4); etc.
