%N A326915 Number of terms of A002386 (primes preceding record prime gaps) in the interval (2^n, 2^(n+1)].
%C A326915 The record prime gaps are in A005250; the corresponding primes are in A002386.
%e A326915 For n=3, there are no primes p_m in A002386 in the range 2^3 = 8 < p_m <= 16 = 2^4, so a(3)=0.
%e A326915 For n=6, there are 2 primes p_m in A002386 in the range 2^6 = 64 < p_m <= 128 = 2^7, namely p_m = 89, 113, so a(6)=2.
%Y A326915 Cf. A000101 (upper ends), A005250 (record gaps).
%K A326915 nonn
%O A326915 0,7
