%N A326106 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct terms such that a(n) is not divisible by any digit of a(n+1).
%C A326106 The sequence ends with the LCM of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} which is 2520 and we have a(1422) = 2520.

%e A326106 The sequence starts with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 20, 30, 40, 33,... and we see indeed that a(10) cannot be 10 as the digit 1 of 10 would divide 9; in the same manner, a(10) = 11 is forbidden, as are 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19; thus a(10) = 20; etc.
