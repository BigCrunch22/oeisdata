%N A326746 a(n) = (sum of digits of n) mod (sum of digits of n+1).
%C A326746 For n > 100 the maximum value of a(n) increases by 1 a total of nine times for every order-of-magnitude increase of n; for n up to 10^10 the largest value of a(n) is 89.
%C A326746 The frequency of occurrence for the values of a(n) for large values of n has an interesting distribution - it is a bell-shaped curve but with large increases for a(n) = 8, and a smaller increase for a(n) = 17. The value a(n) = 8 is likely the most common value as every time n increases by 100 the value of a(n) goes through ten smaller cycles, and 8 appears to be the only value that is present in all ten cycles. The reason a(n) = 17 also appears more often is not clear, although the distribution for n up to 10^10 also shows a slight increase in the number of occurrences for a(n) = 26, suggesting that a(n) values of the form a(n) = 8 + 9 * k, where k >= 0, occur more frequently than one would predicted from the surrounding bell-curve distribution.
%C A326746 The sequence is unbounded because a(10^k-2) = 9*k-1 for k>0. - _Giovanni Resta_, Oct 19 2019

The smaller peak is a(n) = 17. There is also a small bump on the bell-curve at a(n) = 26; this may become a separate peak when n >> 10^10. The bell-curve maximum value is at a(n) = 44.
