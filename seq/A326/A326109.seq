%e A326109 The sequence starts with 1, 111, 113, 1011, 131, 1101, 133, ... and we see indeed that a(2) = 111 is the smallest available integer showing three digits that divide a(1) = 1; in the same manner we have a(3) = 113 [all three digits divide 111], a(4) = 1011 [the three 1s of 1011 divide 113], a(5) = 131 [all three digits divide 1011], etc.
%Y A326109 Cf. A326106 [a(n) is not divisible by any digit of a(n+1)], A326107 [a(n) is divisible by one and only one digit of a(n+1)], A326108  [a(n) is divisible by two and only two digits of a(n+1)] and A326110 [a(n) is divisible by four and only four digits of a(n+1)].
