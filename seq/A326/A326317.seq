%e A326317 The sequence starts with 1,3,6,19,150,46,123,... and we see indeed that:
%e A326317 the digits of {a(1); a(2)} have sum 1 + 3 = 4 (square) and a(1) + a(2) is a square too (4);
%e A326317 the digits of {a(2); a(3)} have sum 3 + 6 = 9 (square) and a(2) + a(3) is a square too (9);
%e A326317 the digits of {a(3); a(4)} have sum 6 + 1 + 9 = 16 (square) and a(3) + a(4) = 6 + 19 is a square too (25);
%e A326317 the digits of {a(4); a(5)} have sum 1 + 9 + 1 + 5 + 0 = 16 (square) and a(4) + a(5) = 19 + 150 is a square too (169 --> square of 13);
%e A326317 the digits of {a(5); a(6)} have sum 1 + 5 + 0 + 4 + 6  = 16 (square) and a(5) + a(6) = 150 + 46 is a square too (196 --> square of 16);
%e A326317 the digits of {a(6); a(7)} have sum 4 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 16 (square) and a(6) + a(7) = 46 + 123 is a squaretoo (169);
%e A326317 etc.
%Y A326317 Cf. A326315 (replace the word "square" by "palindrome"), A326316 (replace the word "square" by "prime"); in A308727 only the sum of the digits is a square.
