%N A326936 Consider an empty list L, and for k = 1, 2, ...: if L contains a pair of consecutive terms summing to k, then let (u, v) be the first such pair: replace the two terms u and v in L with a single term k and set a(u) = -k and a(v) = +k, otherwise append k to L.
%C A326936 The sequence is well defined: sketch of proof, by contradiction:
%C A326936 - if the sequence were not well defined, then we would have some m > 0 such that L(1) = m for any k >= m,
%C A326936 - to prevent L(1) from being merged to L(2) forever, L(2) must always be merged to L(3) for some L(3) < m
%C A326936 - this can happen only finitely many times as the number of terms < m in L strictly decreases at each such merge,
%C A326936 - so at some time, L(1) < L(3) and L(1) merges with L(2) at k = L(1) + L(2), and then L(1) > m, a contradiction, QED.
%C A326936 The given procedure leads to a kind of infinite binary tree T:
%C A326936 - each node has a positive integer value,
%C A326936 - the node with value n has as parent the node with value abs(a(n)) and as sibling the node with value abs(a(n)) - n (see A328654 for the sibling of a node),
%C A326936 - each node has finitely many descendant nodes,
%C A326936 - each node has infinitely many ancestor nodes, so the tree is not rooted (see A328653 for the ancestors of 1),
%C A326936 - two nodes have always a common ancestor,
%C A326936 - see illustration in Links section.
