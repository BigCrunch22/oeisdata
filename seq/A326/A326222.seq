%N A326222 Number of non-Hamiltonian unlabeled n-vertex digraphs (without loops).
%C A326222 A digraph is Hamiltonian if it contains a directed cycle passing through every vertex exactly once.
%H A326222 Gus Wiseman, <a href="/A326222/a326222_1.png">Non-isomorphic representatives of the a(3) = 12 non-Hamiltonian digraphs</a>.
