%N A326905 BII-numbers of set-systems (without {}) closed under intersection.
%C A326905 A binary index of n is any position of a 1 in its reversed binary expansion. The binary indices of n are row n of A048793. We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. Every finite set of finite nonempty sets has a different BII-number. For example, 18 has reversed binary expansion (0,1,0,0,1), and since the binary indices of 2 and 5 are {2} and {1,3} respectively, the BII-number of {{2},{1,3}} is 18. Elements of a set-system are sometimes called edges.
%e A326905 The sequence of all set-systems closed under intersection together with their BII-numbers begins:

%Y A326905 The case with union instead of intersection is A326875.
%Y A326905 The case closed under union and intersection is A326913.
%Y A326905 Set-systems closed under intersection and containing the vertex set are A326903.
%Y A326905 Set-systems closed under intersection are A326901, with unlabeled version A326904.
