%N A326166 Total number of ants after n iterations in male/female Langton's ant variation.
%C A326166 There are male (blue) and female (pink) ants.
%C A326166 The rules governing the behavior of the ants are as follows:
%C A326166 1. On a white square, turn 90 degrees right, flip the color of the square, then move forward one unit.
%C A326166 2. On a black square, turn 90 degrees left, flip the color of the square, then move forward one unit.
%C A326166 3. If a male ant and a female ant occupy the same square, they mate and leave behind an egg.
%C A326166 4. When two ants of the same sex meet on a square, nothing happens.
%C A326166 5. Any ant can only mate with exactly one ant of the other sex each iteration.
%C A326166 6. The egg hatches when the square where the egg is located is no longer occupied by another ant.
%C A326166 7. When there is more than one egg on a square, only one of them can hatch per iteration.
%C A326166 8. The gender of the new ant is male if the square it hatches on is white in that iteration, female otherwise.
%C A326166 9. The color referred to in the previous rule is the color the square has in the first iteration where the new ant is alive.
%C A326166 10. The new ant always looks in north direction (upwards) at birth.
