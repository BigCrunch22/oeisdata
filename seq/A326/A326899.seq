%N A326899 Number of unlabeled connectedness systems covering n vertices without singletons.
%C A326899 We define a connectedness system (investigated by Vim van Dam in 2002) to be a set of finite nonempty sets (edges) that is closed under taking the union of any two overlapping edges.
%e A326899 Non-isomorphic representatives of the a(3) = 4 connectedness systems:
%e A326899   {{1,2,3}}
%e A326899   {{2,3},{1,2,3}}
%e A326899   {{1,3},{2,3},{1,2,3}}
%e A326899   {{1,2},{1,3},{2,3},{1,2,3}}
%Y A326899 The case with singletons is A326871.
%Y A326899 First differences of A072444 (the non-covering case).
%Y A326899 Euler transform of A072445 (the connected case).
%Y A326899 The labeled version is A326877.
