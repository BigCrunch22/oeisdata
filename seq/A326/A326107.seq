%e A326107 The sequence starts with 1, 10, 2, 13, 12, 3,... and we see indeed that a(2) = 10 is the smallest available integer showing a digit 1 as a(1) = 1 must be divisible by one and only one digit of a(2); in the same manner we have a(3) = 2 and we see that a(4) cannot be 11 [because two digits of 11 would divide 2] or 12 [again, the two digits of 12 divide 2]; thus a(4)= 13, etc.
%Y A326107 Cf. A326106 [a(n) is not divisible by any digit of a(n+1)], A326108 [a(n) is divisible by two and only two digits of a(n+1)], A326109  [a(n) is divisible by three and only three digits of a(n+1)] and A326110 [a(n) is divisible by four and only four digits of a(n+1)].
