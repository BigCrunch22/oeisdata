%N A326990 Sum of odd divisors of n that are greater than 1.
%C A326990 Also sum of nonpowers of 2 dividing n, divided the sum of powers of 2 dividing n.
%C A326990 a(n) = 0 iff n is a power of 2.
%C A326990 a(n) = n iff n is an odd prime.
%C A326990 First differs from A284233 at a(15).
%F A326990 a(n) = A000593(n) - 1.
%F A326990 a(n) = (A000203(n) - A038712(n))/A038712(n).
%F A326990 a(n) = A326988(n)/A038712(n).
%e A326990 For n = 18 the divisors of 18 are [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18]. The sum of odd divisors of 18 that are greater than 1 is 3 + 9 = 12, so a(18) = 12. On the other hand, there are four divisors of 18 that are not powers of 2, they are [3, 6, 9, 18], and the sum of them is 3 + 6 + 9, 18 = 36. Also there are two divisors of 18 that are powers of 2, they are [1, 2], and the sum of them is 1 + 2 = 3. Then we have that 36/3 = 12, so a(18) = 12.
