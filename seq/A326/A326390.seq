%N A326390 The number of ways of seating n people around a table for the second time so that k pairs are maintained. T(n,k) read by rows.
%C A326390 Definition requires "pairs" and for n=0 it is assumed that there is 1 way of seating 0 people around a table for the second time so that 0 pairs are maintained and 1 person forms only one pair with him/herself. Therefore T(0,0)=1, T(1,0)=0 and T(1,1)=1.
%C A326390 Sum of each row is equal to n!.
%C A326390 Weighted average of each row using k as weights converges to 2 for large n and is given with following formula: (Sum_{k} T(n,k)*k)/n! = 2/(n-1) + 2 (conjectured).

%e A326390 Assuming initial order was {1,2,3,4,5} (therefore 1 and 5 forms pair as first and last person are neighbors in case of round table) there are 5 sets of ways of seating them again so that 3 pairs are conserved: {1,2,3,5,4}, {2,3,4,1,5}, {3,4,5,2,1}, {4,5,1,3,2}, {5,1,2,4,3}. Since within each set we allow for rotation ({1,2,3,5,4} and {2,3,5,4,1} are different) and reflection ({1,2,3,5,4} and {4,5,3,2,1} are also different) the total number of ways is 5*2*5 and therefore T(5,3)=50.
