%N A326280 Let f(n) be a sequence of distinct Gaussian integers such that f(1) = 0 and for any n > 1, f(n) = f(floor(n/2)) + k(n)*g((1+i)^(A000120(n)-1) * (1-i)^A023416(n)) where k(n) > 0 is as small as possible and g(z) = z/gcd(Re(z), Im(z)); a(n) is the real part of f(n).
%C A326280 The idea underlying this sequence is to build an infinite binary tree of Gaussian integers:
%C A326280 - for any n > 0, f(n) has children f(2*n) and f(2*n+1),
%C A326280 - f(n), f(2*n) and f(2*n+1) form a right triangle,
%C A326280 - when u has child v and v has child w, then the angle between the vectors (u,v) and (v,w) is 45 degrees.
%C A326280 Among the first 2^20-1 terms, some values around the origin are missing: -2 - 3*i, -2, i, 2 - 2*i, 2, 4 + i, 5 - 2*i; will they ever appear?
%C A326280 Graphically, f has interesting features (see representations of f in Links section).
%C A326280 This sequence has similarities with A322574.
