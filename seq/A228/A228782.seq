%N A228782 Irregular triangle read by rows: coefficients of minimal polynomial of a certain algebraic number S2(2*k) from Q(2*cos(Pi/(2*k))) related to the regular (2*k)-gon.
%C A228782 The row length sequence of this table is delta(2*k), k >= 1, with the degree delta(n) = A055034(n) of the algebraic number rho(n):=2*cos(Pi/n).
%C A228782 The algebraic numbers S2(n) have been given in A228780 in the power basis of the degree delta(n) number field Q(rho(n)), with rho(n):=2*cos(Pi/n), n >= 2. Here the even case, n = 2*k, is considered. S2(n) is the square of the sum of the distinct length ratios side/radius and diagonal/radius with the radius of the circle in which a regular n-gon is inscribed. For two formulas for S2(n) in terms of powers of rho(n) see the comment section of A228780.
%C A228782 The minimal (monic) polynomial of S2(2*k) has degree delta(2*k) and is given by p(2*k,x) = Product_{j=1..delta(2*k)} (x - S2(2*k)^{(j-1)}) (mod C(2*k, rho(2*k))) = Sum_{m=0..delta(2*k)} a(k, m)*x^m, where S2(2*k)^{(0)} = S2(2*k) and S2(2*k)^{(j-1)} is the (j-1)-th conjugate of S2(2*L). For the conjugate of an algebraic number in Q(rho(n)) see a comment on A228781.
%C A228782 The motivation to look into this problem originated from emails by _Seppo Mustonen_, who found experimentally polynomials which had as one zero the square of the total length/radius of all chords (sides and diagonals) in the regular n-gon. See his paper given as a link below. The author thanks _Seppo Mustonen_ for sending his paper.

%F A228782 a(k,m) = [x^m] p(2*k, x), with the minimal polynomial p(2*k, x) of S2(2*k) given in the power basis in A228780.
%F A228782 p(2*k, x) is given in a comment above in terms of the S2(2*k) and its conjugates S2(2*k)^{(j-1)}, j = 2, ..., delta(2*k), where delta(2*k) = A055034(2*k).

%e A228782 n = 6, k = 3: p(6, x) = (x - S2(6))*(x - S2(6)^{(1)}),
%e A228782 with S2(6) = 12 + 6*rho(6), where rho(6) = sqrt(3). C(6, x) = x^2 - 3 = (x - rho(6))*(x - (-rho(6))), hence rho(6)^{(1)} - -rho(6) and S2(6)^{(1)} = 12 - 6*rho(6). Thus p(6, x) = 144 - 36*rho(6)^2 - 24*x + x^2, reduced with C(6, rho(6)) = 0, i.e., rho(6)^2 = 3; this becomes finally 36 - 24*x + x^2.
