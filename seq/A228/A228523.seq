%N A228523 Numbers that are not the product of two Fibonacci numbers (not necessarily distinct).
%C A228523 All primes except prime Fibonacci numbers are in this sequence.
%e A228523 Although 12 can be expressed as a product of Fibonacci numbers, it takes three of them, not two, hence 12 is in the list.
%e A228523 There is no way to express 14 as a product of Fibonacci numbers since its larger prime factor, 7, is not a Fibonacci number, hence 14 is in the list.
%e A228523 16 is not in the list because it can be expressed as 2 * 8.
%t A228523 nn = 12; f = Fibonacci[Range[2, nn]]; f2 = Select[Union[Flatten[Outer[Times, f, f]]], # <= f[[-1]] &]; Complement[Range[f[[-1]]], f2] (* _T. D. Noe_, Sep 03 2013 *)
