%N A228935 a(n) = (3 - 6*n)*(-1)^n.
%C A228935 Optimal simple continued fraction (with signed denominators) of tan(1/3).
%C A228935 This expansion is a simple continued fraction a(0) + 1/(a(1) + 1/(a(2) + ...)) with all numerators 1, and the numbers a(n) are signed integers computed with an algorithm that guarantees the fastest convergence for this type of continued fraction.
%C A228935 The algorithm is the same described in A133593. It is as usually based on the Euclidean division algorithm, but instead of taking the floor of the quotients, as it happens for standard continued fractions, the nearest integer is taken, so the remainders can be also negative and the quotients also.
%C A228935 Generally the convergents of this expansion are a subset of the convergents of the standard continued fraction expansion, and they are no more alternatively lesser and greater than the given number: in this special case of tan(1/3) they are all lesser.
%C A228935 The terms of this sequence can be generated by this formula: a(n) = -3*(-1)^n*(2n-1) for n > 0 (the first term is a(0)=0).
%C A228935 Repeating the expansion for other numbers of type 1/k a common pattern seems to emerge. Examples:
%C A228935 tan(1/4) gives 0, 4, -12, 20, -28, 36, -44, 52, -60, 68, -76, 84, ...
%C A228935 tan(1/5) gives 0, 5, -15, 25, -35, 45, -55, 65, -75, 85, -95, 105, ...
%C A228935 so it seems that in general the terms of tan(1/k) are generated by the formula a(n) = (-1)^(n+1)*k*(2n-1) for n > 0. This formula gives this expansion for tan(1/k):
%C A228935 tan(1/k) = 1/(k+1/(-3k+1/(5k-1/(-7k+1/(9k+1/...))))).
%C A228935 This expansion can be rewritten in an equivalent form:
%C A228935 tan(1/k) = 1/(k-1/(3k-1/(5k-1/(7k-1/(9k-1/...))))).
%C A228935 The rule for converting the first form to the second is this: if two consecutive terms have different sign put a minus before the fraction line, otherwise put plus, and take the absolute value of the terms in the denominators.
%C A228935 This general expansion seems to be valid for any real value of k and resembles Lambert's expansion of tan(k).
