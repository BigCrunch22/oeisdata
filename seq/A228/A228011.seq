%N A228011 The largest n-digit number whose last k digits are divisible by k^2 for k = 1..n, otherwise 0.
%C A228011 a(13)=0, a(14)=0 because there are no 13- or 14-digit numbers which satisfy the requirements. The sequence is infinite.

%e A228011 There are ten one-digit numbers divisible by 1 and largest is 9 so a(1)=9.
%e A228011 For two-digit numbers, the second digit must make it divisible by 2^2, which gives 96 as the largest to satisfy the requirement, so a(2)=96.
