%N A228898 Nodes of tree generated as follows: (1,2) is an edge, and if (x,y) is an edge, then (y,x+y) and (y,x^2 + y^2) are edges.
%C A228898 The tree has infinitely many branches which are essentially linear recurrence sequences (and infinitely many which are not).  The extreme branches are (1,2)->(2,3)->(3,5)->(5,8)->... and (1,2)->(2,5)->(5,29)->(29,866)->...  These branches contribute to A228898, as subsequences, the Fibonacci numbers, A000045, and A000283.
%e A228898 Taking the first generation of edges to be G(1) = {(1,2)}, the edge (1,2) grows G(2) = {(2,3), (2,5)}, which grows G(3) = {(3,5), (3,13), (5,7), (5,29)}, ... Expelling duplicate nodes and sorting leave (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 12, 13, 16, 19,...).
