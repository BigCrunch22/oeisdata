%N A228530 Summarize the previous two terms!
%C A228530 a(k) is found by counting the frequency of the digits in terms a(k-1) and a(k-2). Digits with zero frequency are not counted.
%C A228530 At n=54 the sequence enters a cycle of 46 terms so that for n>=100 we have a(k) = a(k-46). - _Lars Blomberg_, Jan 04 2014
%H A228530 Lars Blomberg, <a href="/A228530/b228530.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..145</a> containing the beginning and two full cycles.

%e A228530 For n=5, a(5) is found by counting the frequency of the digits in the last two terms; there are three 1s and three 3s, so you get "three one three three", or 3133.
%Y A228530 Like A005151, but uses the previous two terms instead of just the previous term.
