%N A228010 The number of n-digit numbers whose last k digits are divisible by k^2 for k = 1..n.
%C A228010 The sequence is infinite.

%e A228010 There are ten one-digit numbers divisible by 1 so a(1)=10.
%e A228010 For two-digit numbers, the second digit must make it divisible by 2^2, which gives 22 numbers: 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84, 88, 92, 96 to satisfy the requirement. So a(2)=22.
