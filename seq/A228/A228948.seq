%N A228948 Numbers n such that n^3 + k^2 = m^3 for some k>0, m>0.
%C A228948 Cube root of perfect cubes in A087285 or in A229618 are in the present sequence, but this does not yield all terms, because these sequences require k^2 to be the largest square < m^3.
%C A228948 Numbers k such that Mordell's equation y^2 = x^3 - k^3 has more than 1 integral solution. (Note that it is necessary that x is positive.) In other words, numbers k such that Mordell's equation y^2 = x^3 - k^3 has solutions other than the trivial solution (k,0). - _Jianing Song_, Sep 24 2022
%e A228948 6 is a term since the equation y^2 = x^3 - 6^3 has 5 solutions (6,0), (10,+-28), and (33,+-189). - _Jianing Song_, Sep 24 2022
