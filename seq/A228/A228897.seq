%N A228897 Nodes of tree generated as follows: (1,2) is an edge, and if (x,y) is an edge, then (y,x+y) and (y,x*y) are edges.
%C A228897 The tree has infinitely many branches which are essentially linear recurrence sequences (and infinitely many which are not).  The extreme branches are (1,2)->(2,3)->(3,5)->(5,8)->... and (1,2)->(2,4)->(4,8)->(8,32)->...  These branches contribute to A228897, as subsequences, the Fibonacci numbers, A000045, and the sequence 2^(A000045) = A000302.
%e A228897 Taking the first generation of edges to be G(1) = {(1,2)}, the edge (1,2) grows G(2) = {(2,3), (2,4)}, which grows G(3) = {(3,5), (3,6), (4,6), (4,8)}, ... Expelling duplicate nodes and sorting leave (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12,...).
