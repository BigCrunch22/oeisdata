%N A228425 Number of ways to write n = x + y (x, y > 0) with x*(x+1)/2 + y^2 prime.
%C A228425 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 1.
%C A228425 This implies that there are infinitely many primes of the form x*(x+1)/2 + y^2 (i.e., the sequence A228424 has infinitely many terms).
%C A228425 For m = 3, 4, 5, ... the m-gonal numbers are given by p_m(x) = (m-2)*x*(x-1)/2 + x (x = 0, 1, 2, ...). We note that there are many pairs m > k > 2 such that all sufficiently large integers n can be written as x + y (x, y > 0) with p_k(x) + p_m(y) prime. For example, we conjecture that the pair (k, m) works if k is among 3, 4, 6 , and m > k is not congruent to k modulo 2. For k = 5, we guess that the pair (5, m) works if m is congruent to 0 or 4 modulo 6.
%C A228425 We conjecture that the only pairs (k,m) with 2 < k <= 10 and k< m <= 100 such that any integer n > 1 can be written as x + y (x, y > 0) with p_k(x) + p_m(y) prime, are as follows:  (3,4),(3,6),(3,28),(3,46),(3,52),(3,82),(3,88),(4,7),(4,15),(4,25),(4,27),(4,37),(4,43),(4,63),(4,67),(4,97),(6,25),(6,43),(6,73),(7,10),(7,18),(7,100),(10,15),(10,19),(10,27),(10,37),(10,55),(10,75),(10,79),(10,87),(10,99).
%C A228425 We also conjecture that any integer n > 1 can be written as x + y (x, y > 0) with p_k(x) + p_{k+1}(y) prime, if and only if k is among 3, 39, 99.
