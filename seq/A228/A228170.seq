%N A228170 The least semiprime (A001358) such that between it and the next n semiprimes, but not the next n+1 semiprimes, there are no primes.
%C A228170 If prime_omega(n) as defined as A001222 and a set of values becomes a string, then the 'just' means that its string is not a substring of some larger string. See the example below.
%C A228170 Yet another way to think of this is that between any two consecutive primes there are 'just' n semiprimes with the first one being cited above.
%C A228170 a(91) > 1.8*10^12. - _Giovanni Resta_, Aug 15 2013

%F A228170 a(n) is the next semiprime after A228171(n+1).
%e A228170 a(1) = 9 because between 9 and 10 there are no primes;
%e A228170 a(2) = 33 because between 33 and 35 (the second semiprime past 33) there are no primes;
%e A228170 a(3) = 91 because between 91 and 95 (the third semiprime past 91 with 93 & 94 also semiprimes) there are no primes;
%e A228170 a(4) = 141 because between 141 and 146 (the fourth semiprime past 141 with 142, 143 & 145 also being semiprimes) there are no primes;
%e A228170 the reason a(4) is not 115 is because although there are no primes between 115 and 121, the string "2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 5, 2, 2" is a substring of the string generated by 115 through 123. See the next line.
%e A228170 a(5) = 115 because between 115 and 123 (the fifth semiprime past 115 with 118, 119, 121, and 122 also being semiprimes) there are no primes;
