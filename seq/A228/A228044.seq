%N A228044 Decimal expansion of sum of reciprocals, row 2 of the natural number array, A185787.
%C A228044 Let s(n) be the sum of reciprocals of the numbers in row n of the array T at A185787 given by T(n,k) = n + (n+k-2)*(n+k-1)/2, and let r = (2*Pi/sqrt(7))*tanh(Pi*sqrt(7)/2), as at A226985. Then s(1) = r, and s(2) to s(5) are given by A228044 to A228047.
%C A228044 Let c(k) be the sum of reciprocals of the numbers in column k of T. Then c(1) = 2; c(2) = 11/9, c(4) = 29/50, and c(3) is given by A228049. Let d(n) be the sum of reciprocals of the numbers in the main diagonal, (T(n,n)); then d(2) = (1/12)*Pi^2; d(3) = 1/2, and d(1) is given by A228048.
%C A228044 It appears that Mathematica gives closed-form exact expressions for s(n), c(n) for 1<=n<=20 and further. The same holds for diagonal sums dr(n,n+k), k>=0; and for diagonal sums and dc(n+k,n), k>=0. In any case, general terms for all four sequences can be represented using the digamma function. The representations imply that c(n) is rational if and only if n is a term of A000124, and that dr(n) is rational if and only if n has the form k^2 + 2 for k >= 1.
