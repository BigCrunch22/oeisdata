%N A228950 The index of Simon's piecewise testability congruence, for words of length n over a 2-letter alphabet.
%C A228950 Consider an alphabet with two letters, say {0,1}. For two words v and w over this alphabet, we say v embeds in w, or v is a subsequence of w, if v can be obtained from w by erasing some (occurrences of) letters.
%C A228950 For a natural number n, define two words to be n-equivalent if they have the same subsequences of length up to n. The n-th term of this sequence is the number of equivalence classes of this equivalence relation.

%e A228950 For n=1, here are representatives of each of the four equivalence classes (taking the alphabet to be {0,1}) : empty word, 0, 1, 01.
