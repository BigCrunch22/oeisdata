%N A228818 Decimal expansion of G/c^4 in s^2/(kg * m), where G is the gravitational constant and c = 299792458 m/s is the speed of light in vacuum.
%C A228818 Also decimal expansion of 1/F_p where F_p is the Planck force, see A228817.
%C A228818 According to the law of universal gravitation, the attractive force (F) between two bodies is proportional to the product of their masses (m_1 and M2), and inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r) between them. The Newton's formula is F = G*m_1*m_2/r^2, where G is the constant of gravitation. Using both the Planck force (F_P) and the Einstein's formula E = m*c^2 the law of universal gravitation could be written as F = (G/c^4)*m_1*c^2*m_2*c^2/r^2 = E_1*E_2/(F_P*r^2), where both E_1 and E_2 are the energies of the bodies.
%F A228818 G/c^4 = A070058/A183001 = 1/A228817.
%e A228818 G/c^4 = 6.67384...*10^-11 [(m^3)/(kg*s^2)]/299792458^4 [m^4/s^4] = 8.262...*10^-45 [s^2/(kg*m)] = 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008262... [s^2/(kg*m)].
