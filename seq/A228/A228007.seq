%N A228007 The largest n-digit number whose first k digits are divisible by k^2 for k = 1..n.
%C A228007 There are 7 terms in the sequence and the 7-digit number 6480005 is the largest number to satisfy the requirements.
%e A228007 There are nine one-digit numbers divisible by 1 and the largest is 9, so a(1)=9.
%e A228007 For two-digit numbers, the second digit must make it divisible by 2^2, which gives 96 as the largest to satisfy the requirement, so a(2)=96.
