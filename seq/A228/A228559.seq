%N A228559 Determinant of the n X n matrix with (i,j)-entry equal to 1 or 0 according as i + j is a Sophie Germain prime or not.
%C A228559 If p > 3 and 2*p+1 are both prime, then p == -1 (mod 6). If tau is a permutation of {1,...,n}, and i + tau(i) is a Sophie Germain prime for each i = 1,...,n, then n*(n+1) = sum_{i=1}^n (i + tau(i)) is congruent to -n or 2 - (n - 1) or 3 - (n - 1) or 3 + 3 - (n - 2) modulo 6, which is impossible when n == -1 (mod 6). Therefore a(6*n-1) = 0 for all n > 0.
%C A228559 Note also that (-1)^{n*(n-1)/2}*a(n) is always a square in view of the comments in A228591.
%C A228559 Conjecture: a(n) is nonzero if n is greater than 55 and not congruent to 5 modulo 6.
%C A228559 Zhi-Wei Sun also had some similar conjectures. For example, if b(n) denotes the n X n determinant with (i,j)-entry equal to 1 or 0 according as i + j and 2*(i + j) - 1 are both prime or not, then b(n) is nonzero when n is greater than 125 and not congruent to 3 modulo 6. (Just like a(6*n-1) = 0, we can show that b(6*n-3) = 0.)
