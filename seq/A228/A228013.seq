%N A228013 The smallest n-digit number whose last k digits are divisible by k^2 for k = 1..n, otherwise 0 (for n > 1).
%C A228013 a(13)=0, a(14)=0 because there are no 13- or 14-digit numbers which satisfy the requirements. The sequence is infinite.

%e A228013 There are ten one-digit numbers divisible by 1 and the smallest is 0 so a(1)=0.
%e A228013 For two-digit numbers, the second digit must make it divisible by 2^2, which gives 12 as the smallest to satisfy the requirement, so a(2)=12.
