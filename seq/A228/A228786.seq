%N A228786 Table of coefficients of the minimal polynomials of 2*sin(Pi/n), n >= 1.
%C A228786 s(n) := 2*sin(Pi/n) is, for n >= 2, the length ratio side/R of the regular n-gon inscribed in a circle of radius R. This algebraic number s(n), n >= 1, has the degree gamma(n) := A055035(n), and the row length of this table is gamma(n) + 1.
%C A228786 s(n) has been given in the power basis of the relevant algebraic number field in A228783 for even n (bisected into n == 0 (mod 4) and n == 2 (mod 4)), and in A228785 for odd n.
%C A228786 For the computation of the minimal polynomials ps(n,x), using the coefficients of s(n) in the relevant number field, and the conjugates of the corresponding algebraic numbers rho (giving the length ratios (smallest diagonal)/side in the relevant regular polygons see a comment on A228781. Note that the product of the gamma(n) linear factors (x - conjugates) has to be computed modulo the minimal polynomial of the relevant rho(k) = 2*cos(Pi/k) (called C(k,x=rho(k)) in A187360).
%C A228786 Thanks go to _Seppo Mustonen_, who asked a question about the square of the sum of all lengths in the regular n-gon, which led to this computation of s(n) and its minimal polynomial.
%C A228786 It would be interesting to find out which length ratios in the regular n-gon give the other positive zeros of the minimal polynomial ps(n,x). See some examples below.
%C A228786 The zeros of the row polynomials ps(n,x) are 2*cos(2*Pi*k/c(2*n))) for gcd(k, c(2*n)) = 1, where c(n) = A178182(n), and k from {0, ..., floor(c(2*n)/2)}, for n >= 1. The number of these solutions is gamma(n) = A055035(n). See the formula section. This results from the zeros of the minimal polynomials of sin(2*Pi/n), with coefficients given in A181872/A181873. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Oct 30 2019
%F A228786 a(n, m) = [x^m](minimal polynomial ps(n, x) of 2*sin(Pi/n) over the rationals), n >= 1, m = 0, ..., gamma(n), with gamma(n) = A055035(n).
%F A228786 ps(n,x) = Product_{k=0..floor(c(2*n)/n) and gcd(k, c(2*n)) = 1} (x - 2*cos(2*Pi*k/c(2*n)), with c(2*n) = A178182(2*n), for n >= 1. There are gamma(n) = A055035(n) zeros. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Oct 30 2019
