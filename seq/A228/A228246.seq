%N A228246 a(1)=1; for n >= 2, a(n) = round(x), where x is the average length (not counting draws) of a first-to-n match between two chess players of equal strength.
%C A228246 A first-to-n match between two chess players continues until either player reaches n wins. For example, in the 1978 and 1981 matches between A. Karpov and V. Korchnoi, n was 6; in the 1992 match between B. Fischer and B. Spassky, n was 10.
%C A228246 In chess, as in some other sports, e.g., football, a score k:m is called "big" if |k-m| >= 3. It is interesting that, e.g., a(6) = 9 corresponds to a big score, 6:3, and a(10) = 16 corresponds to a big score, 10:6. Thus a moderately big score in such matches is not a sufficient reason to revise a relative relation of strengths of the winner and the loser.
