%N A378233 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, let i = a(n-2), j = a(n-1). For n > 2, If i*j is a term in A055932, a(n) is the least novel multiple of the smallest prime which does not divide i*j. Otherwise a(n) is the least novel multiple of the greatest prime < Gpf(i*j) which does not divide i*j.
%C A378233 In other words, if the product i*j of adjacent terms has primorial kernel, rad(i*j) =  A002110(k) for some k>= 0, the next term is the smallest novel multiple of prime(k+1). Otherwise a(n) is the smallest novel multiple of p, the greatest prime less than the greatest prime factor of i*j, which does not divide i*j. The definition is similar to that of A359804, the difference being in the second condition, where here the greatest non divisor prime is used instead of the smallest. Same first 9 terms as A359804, departure thereafter.
%C A378233 Fixed points occur at indices 1,2,3,6,9,18, after which it seems there are no more... Primes p = 2,3,5,7,11 occur prior to 2*p, whereas 13 occurs after 26, and 17 occurs after 34.
%C A378233 Conjectures: Sequence is a permutation of the natural numbers A000027, with primes in order. Prime powers and numbers that share the same squarefree kernel also appear in order.
%C A378233 Alternate definition: a(n) = least m*A377774(a(n-2)*a(n-1)), m >= 1, such that a(k) != a(n), k < n. - _Michael De Vlieger_, Nov 23 2024

%e A378233 Since rad(1*2) = 2 = A002110(1), a(3) = prime(2) = 3.
%e A378233 Then rad(2*3) = 6 = A002110(2), so a(4) = prime(3) = 5.
%e A378233 Rad(3*5) = 15, not a term in A055932, 2 is the greatest prime < 5 = Gpf(15) which does not divide 15, so a(5) = 4, the least novel multiple of 2.
%e A378233 Rad(5*4) = 10 so a(6) is 6, the least novel multiple of 3, the greatest prime < 5 which does not divide 10.
%e A378233 a(8) = 7, a(9) = 9, 7*9 = 63 is not in A055932 so a(10) = 15, the least novel multiple of 5, the greatest prime < 7 = Gpf(63) which does not divide 63. a(10) = 15 is the first departure from A359804.
