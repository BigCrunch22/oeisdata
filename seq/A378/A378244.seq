%N A378244 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, and for any n > 2, a(n) is the least number > a(n-1) that belongs to a unique Fibonacci-like sequence starting with two distinct earlier terms.
%C A378244 This sequence is a variant of Ulam numbers (A002858).
%C A378244 There is only one pair of consecutive terms: a(2) = a(1) + 1 as for any n > 2, a(n)+1 belongs to the two Fibonacci-like sequences starting with (a(1), a(n)) and with (a(n), a(1)).

%e A378244 a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 2 by definition.
%e A378244 a(3) must be > 2 and belong to exactly one of the following sequences:
%e A378244 - 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc. (positive Fibonacci numbers),
%e A378244 - 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, etc. (Lucas numbers).
%e A378244 We take a(3) = 4.
