%e A378178 Let s = A001694 and t = A246547.
%e A378178 a(1..6) = 0 since s(9) = 36 is the smallest powerful number that is not a prime power.
%e A378178 a(7) = 1, since only s(9) = 36 is such that t(8) < 36 < t(9), i.e., 32 < 36 < 49.
%e A378178 a(8) = 0, since there are no powerful numbers between t(9) = 49 and t(10) = 64.
%e A378178 a(9) = 1, since only s(12) = 72 is such that t(10) < 72 < t(9), i.e., 64 < 72 < 81.
%e A378178 a(10) = 2, since t(11) < s(14..15) < t(12), i.e., 100 and 108 exceed 81 but not 121, etc.
