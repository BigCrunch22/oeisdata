%N A378316 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2. For n > 2, a(n) is the sum of the digits of a(n-2) plus the sum of the same digits occurring in all terms a(i); 1 <= i <= n-2.
%C A378316 Definition related to that of the paint sprayer sequence A279818 so we may see similar behaviors and plots for this sequence.

%C A378316 Let c(d) be the cardinality of digits d in a(k), k = 1..n-m. Then a(n) is the sum of d*c(d) across the set of (distinct) digits in a(n-m), m = 2. Then it is easy to see that zeros have no effect on the sums.
%C A378316 Scatterplot shows "rays" associated with distinct digits in a(n-2), therefore there are 2^(b-1) rays. Since b = 10, there are 512 rays in the plot, just as there are in A279818.
%C A378316 A279818 is the case regarding m = 1.
%C A378316 A378360(n) is the sum of (d+[d=0])*c(d) across the set of digits in a(n-m), m = 1, starting instead with a(1) = 0, so as to count zeros, and thus the scatterplot shows 1024 rays. (End)

%e A378316 Let c(d) be the number of digits d in a(k), k = 1..n-2.
%e A378316 a(3) = 1 since a(1) = 1.
%e A378316 a(4) = 2 since a(2) = 2.
%e A378316 a(5) = 2 since a(1) = a(3) = 1, i.e., 1*c(1) = 1*2 = 2.
%e A378316 a(6) = 4 since a(2) = a(4) = 2, i.e., 2*c(2) = 2*2 = 4.
%e A378316 a(7) = 6 since a(2) = a(4) = a(5) = 2, i.e., 2*c(2) = 2*3 = 6.
%e A378316 a(13) = 11 since a(11) = 12, and 1*c(1) + 2*c(2) = 1*3 + 2*4 = 3+8 = 11.
%e A378316 a(15) = 5 since a(13) = 11, and 1*c(1) = 1*5 = 5; note, there is 1 distinct digit d = 1, but two 1's in a(13), etc. (End)
