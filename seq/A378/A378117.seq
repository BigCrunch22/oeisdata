%e A378117 We can take a(0) = 0.
%e A378117 We cannot take a(1) = 0 as there are no pairs of consecutive terms summing to 0.
%e A378117 We can take a(1) = 1.
%e A378117 We cannot take a(2) = 0 as we already have one pair of consecutive terms summing to 1.
%e A378117 We can take a(2) = 1.
%e A378117 We cannot take a(3) = 0 as we already have one pair of consecutive terms summing to 1.
%e A378117 We cannot take a(3) = 1 as we already have one pair of consecutive terms summing to 2.
%e A378117 We can take a(3) = 2.
