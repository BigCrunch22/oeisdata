%N A378722 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2. For n > 2 a(n) is the smallest number not already a term which is divisible by A007947(a(n-1)/A020639(a(n-1))).
%C A378722 In other words a(n) is the least novel multiple of the squarefree kernel of a(n-1)/p, where p is the smallest prime factor of a(n-1).
%C A378722 If a(n-1) is prime, a(n) is the smallest unused number in the sequence so far.
%C A378722 Conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers with primes in order.
%e A378722 a(2)= 2 (given), therefore a(3) is the smallest number not already a term which is divisible by the squarefree kernel of 2/2 = 1. Thus a(3) = 3. Likewise a(4) = 4. Since A007947(4/2) = 2, a(5) = 6, the least novel multiple of 2.
%Y A378722 Cf. A007947, A020693.
