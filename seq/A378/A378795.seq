%N A378795 Ulam numbers that are semiprimes (or biprimes).
%C A378795 Ulam numbers: a(1) = 1; a(2) = 2; for n>2, a(n) = least number > a(n-1) which is a unique sum of two distinct earlier terms.
%e A378795 4 is a term because 4=2*2 is the product of 2 (not distinct) primes and 4 is an Ulam number.
%e A378795 6 is a term because 6=2*3 is the product of 2 distinct primes and 6 is an Ulam number.
%e A378795 57 is a term because 57=3*19 is the product of 2 distinct primes and 57 is an Ulam number.
