%N A378843 Number of compositions (ordered partitions) of n into distinct squarefree divisors of n.
%e A378843 a(6) = 7 because we have [6], [3, 2, 1], [3, 1, 2], [2, 3, 1], [2, 1, 3], [1, 3, 2] and [1, 2, 3].
%e A378843 a(12) = 24 because we have [6, 3, 2, 1] and 4! = 24 permutations.
%t A378843 a[n_] := Module[{d = Select[Divisors[n], SquareFreeQ]}, Total[(Length /@ Select[Subsets[d], Total[#] == n &])!]]; a[0] = 1; Array[a, 100, 0] (* _Amiram Eldar_, Dec 10 2024 *)
