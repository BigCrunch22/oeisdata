%N A378728 The total number of fires in a rooted undirected infinite 5-ary tree with a self-loop at the root, when the chip-firing process starts with (5^n-1)/4 chips at the root.
%C A378728 Each vertex of this tree has degree 6. If a vertex has at least 6 chips, the vertex fires, and one chip is sent to each neighbor. The root sends 1 chip to each of its five children and one chip to itself.
%C A378728 The order of the firings doesn't affect the number of firings.
%C A378728 This number of chips is interesting because the stable configuration has 1 chip for every vertex in the top n layers.
%C A378728 a(n) is partial sums of A014917.
%C A378728 For binary trees, the corresponding sequence is A045618.
%C A378728 For ternary trees, the corresponding sequence is A212337.
%C A378728 For 4-ary trees, the corresponding sequence is A378727.
%C A378728 a(2k-1) is divisible by 12.

%F A378728 a(n) = ((2n - 3) 5^n + 2n + 3)/32.
