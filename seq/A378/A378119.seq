%N A378119 a(n) is the smallest positive k such that the digit sums of k and k + 1 are both divisible by n, or -1 if no such pair exists.
%C A378119 It is clear that a(n) must be -1 if n is a multiple of three since if we assume (hoping for a contradiction) that there exist k, k+1 both of which have digit sums that are multiples of 3, then k and k+1 must themselves both be divisible by 3, a contradiction.

%F A378119 a(n) = A051885(n) * 10^q - 1, where q is 9^(-1) (mod n) for n > 1 and n not a multiple of 3 (see linked proof). - _Colin Beveridge_, Dec 16 2024
%e A378119 a(2) = 19 because both 19 and 20 have digit sums that are multiples of 2: 1+9 = 10 = 5*2 and 2+0 = 2 = 1*2, it is easily checked (by exhaustion) that there is no smaller pair of consecutive integers with this property.
