%N A378293 a(1) = 1. For n > 1 if a(n-1) is a novel term a(n) = number of a(i); 1 <= i <= n-1 whose sum of decimal digits does not exceed A007953(a(n-1)). If a(n-1) has occurred k (>1) times, a(n) = k*a(n-1).
%C A378293 The first condition of the definition implies that if a(n-1) is a novel term then a(n) <= n-1, with equality iff A007953(a(n-1)) >= A007953(a(i)); i = 1..n-1. Only the second condition of the definition can produce a(n) > n, consequent to repeats of a(n-1).

%e A378293 a(1) = 1 (a given novel term) means a(2) = 1 since there is just one term having digit sum not exceeding 1.
%e A378293 Since 1 has now occurred twice, a(3) = 2*1 = 2, another novel term with digit sum = 2.
%e A378293 a(4) = 3 since there are now 3 terms up to and including a(3) = 3 with digit sum <= 3.
%e A378293 This pattern continues(4, 5, 6, ...) until reaching a(11) = 10, a novel term with digit sum = 1. At this point the number of terms in {a(1), a(2), ..., a(11)} having digit sum equal to at most 1 is 3, so a(12) = 3.
%e A378293 Then since 3 has been seen twice, a(13) = 6; and so on.
