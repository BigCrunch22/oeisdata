%N A378199 Number of digit patterns of length n such that all integers of that digital type share a common prime factor of a different digital type.
%C A378199 a(n) gives the number of distinct digit patterns (or digital types, as per A266946) such that all integers of that digital type share a common prime factor of a different digital type.
%C A378199 The number of remaining digit patterns not counted toward a(n) is given by A376918(n).
%C A378199 A particular digit pattern of length n is counted toward a(n) if it is not counted toward A376918(n).
%C A378199 All digital types counted toward a(n) result in composites for any values of the distinct digits in the pattern, without the need to run primality tests on all numbers of that digital type individually.
%C A378199 The requirement for a divisor of a different digital type only affects reprigits of the form AA..AA and acts to exclude that pattern iff the n-repunit is prime (n in A004023).
%C A378199 A164864(n) gives the total number of possible digit patterns of length n and is therefore an upper bound for a(n).
%C A378199 a(n) is nonmonotonic and takes on small values for prime n and large values for n with a large number of nontrivial divisors (A070824). This is a consequence of divisibility rules that are formulated for prime divisors of 10^r-1 or 10^r+1 (where r divides n) in terms of the sum or alternating sum of r-digit blocks, respectively [see S. Shirali, First Steps in Number Theory: A Primer on Divisibility, Universities Press, 2019, pp. 42-49].
%C A378199 a(n) coincides with row sums of T(n,k) in A378761 for n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18. - _Dmytro Inosov_, Dec 23 2024

%F A378199 a(n) = A164864(n) - A376918(n).
%F A378199 a(n) = A164864(n) - A267013(n) - A377727(n).
%F A378199 a(n) <= A164864(n).
%e A378199 For n=2, there are only two possible digit patterns, "AA" and "AB". Neither of them is counted toward a(2) because the common prime factor of all integers with the pattern "AA" is 11, which is a prime repunit and is therefore of the same digital type "AA", whereas integers of the digital type "AB" have no common prime factors. Indeed, AB = 10*A + 1*B, and GCD(10,1)=1.
%e A378199 For n=3, the repdigit pattern "AAA" is counted toward a(3) because the repunit 111 is not a prime, hence all integers of the digital type "AAA" are divisible by prime factors of 111, which are 3 and 37, both of a different digital type from "AAA".
%e A378199 Counterexample: The digit pattern "ABA" is not counted toward a(3) because ABA = 101*A + 10*B, and since GCD(101,10) = 1, this digital type has no common prime factors.
%e A378199 The pattern "ABAB" is counted toward a(4) because it is divisible by 101 for any A > 0 and B >= 0, and 101 has a different digital type from ABAB. Indeed, ABAB = A*1010 + B*101, which is identically divisible by 101. In total there are four 4-digit patterns that are counted: ABBA, AABB, AAAA (all of them divisible by 11) and ABAB (divisible by 101). Therefore, a(4) = 4.
%e A378199 The pattern "ABCDEFGHIJ" that contains all possible digits exactly once is counted toward a(10) because its sum of digits is 1+2+...+9 = 45, which is divisible by 9. Therefore, all integers with the digital type "ABCDEFGHIJ" share the common prime factor 3.
