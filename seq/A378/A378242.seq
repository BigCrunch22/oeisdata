%N A378242 Lexicographically earliest sequence of nonnegative integers such that each term does not belong to a Fibonacci-like sequence starting with two earlier terms.
%C A378242 In other words, for any n > 0, a(n) is as small as possible so as not to belong to a sequence F defined by F(0) = a(i), F(1) = a(j) for some i, j < n, and then F(k+2) = F(k) + F(k+1).
%C A378242 By necessity, the sequence is strictly increasing.

%e A378242 We can take a(1) = 0, as the first term is only required to be nonnegative.
%e A378242 We cannot take a(2) = 0, as 0 belongs to the Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 0 and 0.
%e A378242 We can take a(2) = 1.
%e A378242 From now on, we can no longer choose a Fibonacci number.
%e A378242 We can take a(3) = 4, the first nonnegative number that is not a Fibonacci number.
