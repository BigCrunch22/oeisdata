%N A378376 Smallest starting x which requires n steps to reach 1 under the map x -> 3x-1 if x odd, x -> 3x-1 or x/2 if x even.
%C A378376 The number of steps required is A261870(x) so that a(n) = x is the smallest x where A261870(x) = n.
%C A378376 a(n) <= 2^n is a simple upper bound, since x = 2^n requires n steps to reach 1.
%C A378376 But 2*a(n-1) = x is not an upper bound on a(n), since although x/2 = a(n-1) requires a further n-1 steps, x can also step to 3x-1 and doing so might be fewer steps (which it is for example at n=45).
%C A378376 a(n) >= (a(n-1)+1)/3 is a lower bound since a(n) = x must have 3x-1 >= a(n-1) so as to reach somewhere requiring n-1 further steps.
%C A378376 If a(n-1) == 2 (mod 6), then equality a(n) = (a(n-1)+1)/3 holds since then a(n) is odd and its first step must be 3x-1 (as for example at n=4).

%e A378376 For n=4, a(4) = 3 is the smallest x requiring n=4 steps to reach 1 (by trajectory 3 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1).
%e A378376 a(4) = 3 is also an example where a(n) is its lower bound (a(n-1)+1)/3 (with a(3) = 8).
