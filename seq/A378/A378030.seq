%N A378030 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers such that a(a(n)) = a(a(n)-1) + a(a(n)-2).
%C A378030 A self-referencing Fibonacci sequence. The terms appear to be concentrated along two lines, a lower straight line where a(n) is approximately n and an upper curved line where a(n) ~ n^2/4.
%C A378030 The missing numbers are 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 13, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 27, 29, 31, ... .
