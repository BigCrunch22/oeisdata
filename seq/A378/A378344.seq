%N A378344 Number of fixed site animals with n nodes on the nodes of the prismatic pentagonal tiling.
%C A378344 Site animals on a lattice (regular graph) are connected induced subgraphs up to translation.
%C A378344 Dual to the polyhouses, AKA the site animals on the nodes of the elongated triangular tiling, counted by A197158, insofar as the tilings are each others' duals.
%C A378344 The Madras reference gives a good treatment of site animals on general lattices.
%C A378344 It is a consequence of the Madras work that lim_{n\to\infty} a(n+1)/a(n) converges to some growth constant c.
%C A378344 Terms a(1)-a(19) were found by running a generalization of Redelmeier's algorithm. The transfer matrix algorithm (TMA) is more efficient than Redelmeier's for calculating regular polyominoes, and may give more terms here too. See the Jensen reference for a treatment of the TMA. See the Vöge and Guttman reference for an implementation of the TMA on the triangular lattice to count polyhexes, A001207.

%F A378344 It is widely believed site animals on 2-dimensional lattices grow asymptotically to kc^n/n, where k is a constant and c is the growth constant, dependent only on the lattice. See the Madras and Slade reference.
%Y A378344 The platonic tilings are associated with the following sequences: square A001168; triangular A001207; and hexagonal A001420.
