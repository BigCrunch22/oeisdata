%N A378362 Number of fixed site animals containing n nodes on the nodes of the cairo pentagonal tiling.
%C A378362 Site animals on a lattice (regular graph) are induced subgraphs up to translation.
%C A378362 Is dual to the polycairos counted by A196991, AKA site animals on the nodes of the snub square tiling, insofar that these tilings are each others' duals.
%C A378362 The Madras reference gives a good treatment of site animals on general lattices.
%C A378362 It is a consequence of the Madras work that lim_{n\to\infty} a(n+1)/a(n) converges to some growth constant c.
%C A378362 Terms a(1)-a(20) were found by running a generalization of Redelmeier's algorithm. The transfer matrix algorithm (TMA) is more efficient than Redelmeier's for calculating regular polyominoes, and may give more terms here too. See the Jensen reference for a treatment of the TMA. See the Vöge and Guttman reference for an implementation of the TMA on the triangular lattice to count polyhexes, A001207.

%F A378362 It is widely believed site animals on 2-dimensional lattices grow asymptotically to kc^n/n, where k is a constant and c is the growth constant, dependent only on the lattice. See the Madras and Slade reference.
%e A378362 There are six translationally distinct nodes in the cairo pentagonal tiling, so a(1)=6.
%Y A378362 The platonic tilings are associated with the following sequences: square A001168; triangular A001207; and hexagonal A001420.
%Y A378362 The other 8 isogonal tilings are associated with these, A197160, A197158, A196991, A196992, A197461, A196993, A197464, A197467.
