%N A378148 a(n) is the number of distinct trapezoids having integer sides and height with exactly one pair of parallel sides and area n.
%C A378148 The number of trapezoids having integer sides and height, which are neither right-angled nor isosceles, is a(n) - A378149(n) - A378150(n). The first trapezoid, which is neither right-angled nor isosceles, appears at a(36).
%C A378148 a(p) = 0 for prime p. Proof: Suppose there is a trapezoid with integer sides and prime area p. Then in p = m*h (m is the average of the parallel sides and h is the height of the trapezoid) m = p and h = 1 or m = p/2 and h = 2. At least one nonparallel side of the trapezoid is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with leg h. Legs in integer right triangles are >= 3. This is a contradiction and therefore a(p) = 0.
%C A378148 A214602 is the index of the positive terms in this sequence.
%C A378148 There are also integer-sided trapezoids with integer area that do not have an integer height. For example, the trapezoid with sides p = 630, d = 615, q = 5, f = 40 (p and q are parallel) has an area of 12192 and a height of h = 38.4.

%F A378148 a(p) = 0 for prime p.
%e A378148 a(54) = 7 because there are 7 distinct trapezoids [p, d, q, f, h] (p and q are parallel, height h) having integer sides and height with area 54:[17, 10, 1, 10, 6], [13, 6, 5, 10, 6], [22, 5, 14, 5, 3], [20, 3, 16, 5, 3], [8, 15, 1, 20, 12], [7, 12, 2, 13, 12], [15, 4, 12, 5, 4].
