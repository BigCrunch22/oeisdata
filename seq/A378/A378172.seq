%e A378172 a(1) = 1, k = 4, since both 3 and 5 are prime and thus squarefree.
%e A378172 2 is not in the sequence since 4*2+1 = 9 is not squarefree.
%e A378172 a(2) = 4, k = 16 since both 15 and 17 are squarefree.
%e A378172 a(3) = 8, k = 32, since both 31 and 33 are squarefree.
%e A378172 a(4) = 9, k = 36, since both 35 and 37 are squarefree.
%e A378172 16 is not in the sequence since 16*4-1 = 63 = 3^2*7 is not squarefree, etc.
