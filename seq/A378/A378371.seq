%N A378371 Distance between n and the least non prime power >= n, allowing 1.
%C A378371 Non prime powers allowing 1 (A361102) are numbers that are not a prime power (A246655), namely 1, 6, 10, 12, 14, 15, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, ...
%F A378371 a(n) = A378372(n) - n.
%e A378371 The least non prime power >= 4 is 6, so a(4) = 2.
