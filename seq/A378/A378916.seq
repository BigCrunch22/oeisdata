%N A378916 a(n) is the smallest positive integer having n decompositions of twice its value into sums of two noncomposite numbers.
%C A378916 a(n) is the index of first n in A001031.
%e A378916 For n = 3 we have that the first 3 in A001031 has index 7 and twice 7 is 14 and 14 has 3 decompositions into sums of two noncomposite numbers as follows: [1 + 13], [3 + 11], [7 + 7], so a(3) = 7.
