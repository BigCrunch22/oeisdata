%e A208646 If you rotate the first number, 9861, 180 degrees about its center, and put a negative sign in front, you get the second number: -1986. Similarly, the third and fourth numbers are rotations of each other, as well as of the fifth and sixth numbers.  Therefore the eighth number is the rotation and negation of the seventh number, 8961, which would be -1698.
