%N A208478 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = number of partitions of n with positive k-th rank.
%C A208478 We define the k-th rank of a partition as the k-th part minus the number of parts >= k. Every partition of n has n ranks. This is a generalization of the Dyson's rank of a partition which is the largest part minus the number of parts. Since the first part of a partition is also the largest part of the same partition so the Dyson's rank of a partition is the case for k = 1.
%C A208478 The sum of the k-th ranks of all partitions of n is equal to zero.
%C A208478 Also T(n,k) = number of partitions of n with negative k-th rank.
%C A208478 It appears that reversed rows converge to A000070, the same as A208482. - _Omar E. Pol_, Mar 11 2012
%C A208478 From _Omar E. Pol_, Dec 12 2019: (Start)
%C A208478 1) The k-th part of a partition of n is also the number of parts >= k of its conjugate partition.
%C A208478 2) The k-th rank of a partitions is also the number of parts >= k of its conjugate partition minus the number of parts >= k.
%C A208478 For example: for n = 9 consider the partition [5, 3, 1]. The first part is 5, so the conjugate partition has five parts >= 1. The second part is 3, so the conjugate partition has three parts >= 2. The third part is 1, so the conjugate partition has only one part >= 3. The mentioned conjugate partition is [3, 2, 2, 1, 1]. And conversely, consider the partition [3, 2, 2, 1, 1]. The first part is 3, so the conjugate partition has three parts >= 1. The second part is 2, so the conjugate partition has two parts >= 2. the Third part is 2, so the conjugate partition has two parts >= 3, and so on. In this case the conjugate partition is [5, 3, 1].
%C A208478 3) The difference between the k-th part and the (k+1)-st part of the partition of n is also the number of k's in its conjugate partition. For example: consider the partition [5, 3, 1]. The difference between the first and the second part is 5 - 3 = 2, equals the number of 1's in its conjugate partition. The difference between the second and the third part is 3 - 1 = 2, equals the number of 2's in its conjugate partition. The difference between the third and the fourth (virtual) part is 1 - 0 = 1, equals the number of 3's in its conjugate partition [3, 2, 2, 1, 1]. And conversely, consider the partition [3, 2, 2, 1, 1]. The difference between the first and the second part is 3 - 2 = 1, equals the number of 1's in its conjugate partition. The difference between the second and the third part is 2 - 2 = 0, equals the number of 2's in its conjugate partition. The difference between the third and the fourth part is 2 - 1 = 1, equals the number of 3's in its conjugate partition, and so on.
%C A208478 4) The list of n ranks of a partition of n equals the list of n ranks multiplied by -1 of its conjugate partition. For example the nine ranks of the partition [5, 3, 1] of 9 are [2, 1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0], and the nine ranks of its conjugate partition [3, 2, 2, 1, 1] are [-2, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0].
