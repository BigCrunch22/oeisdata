%N A293248 Let S be the sequence of rational numbers generated by these rules: 1 is in S, and if u/v is in S (with gcd(u, v) = 1), then (u+1)/v and u/(v+1) are in S, and duplicates are deleted as they occur; a(n) = the denominator of the n-th term of S.

%e A293248 S(1) = 1 by definition; so a(1) = 1.
%e A293248 (1+1)/1 = 2 has not yet occurred; so S(2) = 2 and a(2) = 1.
%e A293248 1/(1+1) = 1/2 has not yet occurred; so S(3) = 1/2 and a(3) = 2.
%e A293248 (2+1)/1 = 3 has not yet occurred; so S(4) = 3 and a(4) = 1.
%e A293248 2/(1+1) = 1 has already occurred.
