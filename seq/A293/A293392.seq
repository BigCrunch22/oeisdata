%N A293392 Total number of ON cells after n-th stage in a 90-degree sector of the cellular automaton of A267190.
%C A293392 The structure looks like a tree which arises from one of the four spokes of the structure of the cellular automaton of A267190.
%C A293392 a(n) is the total number of ON cells after n-th stage.
%C A293392 For n >> 1 the structure looks like a square which is rotated 45 degrees.
%C A293392 First differs from A161336 at a(17), where A161336 is a version of A161330 (the snowflake cellular automaton).
%C A293392 First differs from A266534 at a(16), where A266534 is a version of A151895.
%C A293392 First differs from A266536 at a(13), where A266536 is a version of A170896 (the Schrandt-Ulam cellular automaton).
%C A293392 From _Omar E. Pol_, Oct 16 2017: (Start)
%C A293392 The graph of both A266536 and this sequence are very similar.
%C A293392 For n >> 1, it appears that A266534(n) < A161336(n) < a(n) < A266536(n).
%C A293392 The graphs of these four sequences are similar, and the behavior looks like percolation.
%C A293392 It appears that there are no recurrences in these four sequences. Thus it appears that there are no recurrences in A151895, A161330, A267190 and A170896. (End)
