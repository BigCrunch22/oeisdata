%e A293909 a(9) = 2; Both 2(9)-2 = 16 and 2(9)+2 = 20 have two Goldbach partitions: 16 = 13+3 = 11+5 and 20 = 17+3 = 13+7. Note that 13-3 = 10 and 17-3 = 14 are the largest differences of the primes among the Goldbach partitions of 2n-2 and 2n+2. The Goldbach partitions of 2(9) = 18 are 13+5 = 11+7. Since 13-5 = 8 and 11-7 = 4 are both less than min(10,14) = 10, a(9) = 2.
