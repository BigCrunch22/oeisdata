%N A293729 Let P be the sequence of distinct lattice points defined by the following rules: P(1) = (0,0), P(2) = (1,0), and for any n > 2, P(n) is the closest lattice point at integer distance to P(n-1) such that the angle of the vectors (P(n-2), P(n-1)) and (P(n-1), P(n)), say t, satisfies 0 < t < Pi, and in case of a tie, maximize the angle t; a(n) = X-coordinate of P(n).
%C A293729 See A293730 for the corresponding Y-coordinates.
%C A293729 The following diagram depicts the angle t cited in the name:

%C A293729 This sequence has building features in common with A293539.
%C A293729 This sequence has fractal features: the representation of the first 200,000 points of the sequence seems chaotic; however, many portions of the sequence are duplicated elsewhere, possibly after rotating them by an integral multiple of 90 degrees (see representation of such duplication in Links section).
%C A293729 The variant P' of this sequence where we minimize the angle t in case of a tie has simple patterns that repeat themselves in a square spiral (see representation of P' in Links section).
