%N A293981 Start with 209; if even, divide by 2; if odd, add the next three primes: Trajectory of 209 under iterations of A174221, the "PrimeLatz" map.
%C A293981 Periodic with period of length 30, starting at a(941) = 60.
%C A293981 Angelini conjectures that the trajectory under A174221 becomes periodic for any initial value. He called this the PrimeLatz conjecture (as tribute to L. Collatz, known for the 3n+1 conjecture).
%C A293981 It has been checked that the loop (9, ..., 18) (= A193230(19..48)) is the only loop (except for the fixed point 0) at least up to values not exceeding 10^8 (result due to _Hans Havermann_), and the trajectory of every positive integer <= 10^4 does end in this loop.
%C A293981 See A293980 for the number of iterations required to reach an element of this loop, depending on the starting value.
%C A293981 Most small initial values have a very small orbit of few more than the 30 elements of the loop. N = 83 = A293979(0) is the most remarkable exception, having an orbit of 16180 + 30 elements, cf. A293979.
%C A293981 N = 443 = A293978(0) is another exception, with an orbit of 9066+30 elements (see A293978).
%C A293981 N = 209 has the third largest genuinely different orbit among small initial values (of course, any N = 2^k*a(n) merges into the sequence a(n) after k steps), of 941 + 30 elements. This motivates the present sequence.
%C A293981 The fact that the loop is entered at a(941) = 60 = A193230(2), while the trajectories of 83 and 443 enter the loop at the term 26 = A193230(14), prove that this orbit is genuinely different from that of 83 and 443.
%C A293981 The horizontal rays in the graph correspond to factors of 2: division by 2 is one possible step, and for large numbers adding the next 3 primes roughly amounts to multiplying the value by 4, the prime gaps being "negligible".

%e A293981 The initial value a(0) = 209 is odd, so we add to 209 the next 3 primes (211, 223 and 227) to get a(1) = 870.
%e A293981 a(1) = 870 is even, so we divide by 2 to get a(2) = 435, and so on.
%e A293981 After 667 iterations, we get a(667) = 517468668525760. This is the largest value we will reach. Since this is even we divide by 2 to get a(668).
%e A293981 The result a(668) is again even, so we divide by 2 once more to get a(669), and so on...
%e A293981 After iteration 935, we reach a(935) = 3840. The next 6 iterations consist of dividing by 2, until we get a(941) = 60 = A193230(2). This is an element of the loop: after dividing two more times by 2 and 28 other iterations later, we get again 60, and the sequence has become periodic.
