%N A293495 Number of balanced binary words of length n whose index is less than (5 + sqrt(5))/2.
%C A293495 The index (also called "exponent" or "critical exponent") is the largest possible value of n/p, where n is the length of a subword (contiguous block) with period p.
%C A293495 A word is balanced if, for pairs of subwords of the same length, the number of 0's differ by at most 1.
%C A293495 It is known that there exist infinite balanced words with index (5+sqrt(5))/2; for example, the infinite Fibonacci word (A003849). So a(n) is positive for all n. Furthermore, (5 + sqrt(5))/2 is the minimum possible index for which there exist balanced infinite words, which accounts for its special role here.
%e A293495 For n=5 the 18 words are {00010, 00100, 00101, 01110, 01010, 01001} and their reversals and complements.
%Y A293495 Cf. A003849.
%Y A293495 The balanced words (with no restriction on index) are counted by A005598.
