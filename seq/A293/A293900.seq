%N A293900 Number of permutations of the divisors of n that are greater than 1, in which consecutive elements are not coprime and no divisor d may occur later than any divisor e if e < d and A007947(e) = A007947(d). That is, any subset of divisors sharing the same squarefree part occur always in ascending order inside the permutation.
%C A293900 This is a more restricted variant of A163820, inspired by _David A. Corneth_'s suggestion (personal e-mail) for optimizing its computation.

%F A293900 Iff n = p^k for some prime p and k >= 1 [that is, n is a term of A000961 > 1], then a(n) = 1.
%F A293900 a(n) = A163820(n)/A293902(n).
%e A293900 The proper divisors of 12 are 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. a(12) = 9 because we can find nine permutations of them such that consecutive elements d and e are not coprime (that is, gcd(d,e) > 1) and where no divisor d is ever followed by divisor e such that A007947(d) = A007947(e) and e < d. These nine allowed permutations are (note that 2 must become before 4 and 6 must become before 12):
