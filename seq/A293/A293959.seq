%N A293959 Construct a triangle T(n,k) (0 <= k <= n) of strings of integers, where T(0,0) = {0}, T(n,n) = {n}, and otherwise T(n,k) is the concatenation of T(n-1,k-1) and T(n-1,k). The sequence is obtained by reading across the rows of the triangle, concatenating the successive strings.
%C A293959 The string T(n,k) contains binomial(n,k) numbers.
%e A293959 The first few rows of the triangle (where the strings T(n,k) are shown without spaces for legibility) are:
