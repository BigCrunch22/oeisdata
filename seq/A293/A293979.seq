%N A293979 Start with 83; if even, divide by 2; if odd, add next three primes: Orbit of 83 under iterations of A174221, the "PrimeLatz" map.
%C A293979 Periodic with period of length 30, starting at a(16180) = 26.
%C A293979 Angelini conjectures that the trajectory under A174221 becomes periodic for any initial value. He called this the PrimeLatz conjecture (as tribute to L. Collatz, known for the 3n+1 conjecture).
%C A293979 It has been checked that the loop (9, ..., 18) (= A193230(19..48)) is the only loop (except for the fixed point 0) at least up to values not exceeding 10^8, and the trajectory of every positive integer <= 10^4 does end in this loop.
%C A293979 See A293980 for the number of iterations required to reach an element of this loop, depending on the starting value.
%C A293979 Most small initial values have a very small orbit of few more than the 30 elements of the loop. N = 83 = a(0) is the most remarkable exception (having an orbit of 16180 + 30 elements), which motivates this sequence. Of course, the trajectory of any N = a(n)*2^k, e.g., 2*83 = 166, 4*83 = 332, 8*83 = 664, 2*370 = 740, ..., merges into the same orbit after k steps.
%C A293979 N = 443 = A293978(0) is another exception, with an orbit of 9066+30 elements (see A293978), and N = 209 also has a comparatively large orbit of 941 + 30 elements, distinct from those of 83 and 443.

%e A293979 The initial value a(0) = 83 is odd, so we add to 83 the next 3 primes (89, 97 and 101) to get a(1) = 370.
%e A293979 370 is even, so we divide by 2 to get a(2) = 185, and so on.
%e A293979 After 8337 iterations, we get a(8337) = 10780054699424618132644155893087038044817868609971935265882538442720. This is the largest value we will reach. Since this is even we divide by 2 to get a(8338).
%e A293979 The result a(8338) is again even, so we divide by 2 once more to get a(8339), and so on...
%e A293979 After iteration 16171, we reach a(16171) = 768. The next 8 iterations consist of dividing by 2, until we get a(16179) = 3. Since this is odd, we add the next three primes (5, 7 and 11) to reach a(16180) = 26 = A193230(14). This is an element of the loop: 30 iterations later, we get again 26, and the sequence has become periodic.
