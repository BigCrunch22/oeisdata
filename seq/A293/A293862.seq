%N A293862 Sequence of signed integers where each is chosen to be as small as possible (in absolute value) subject to the condition that no three terms a(j), a(j+k), a(j+2k) (for any j and k) form an arithmetic progression; in case of a tie, preference is given to the positive value.
%C A293862 This sequence is a "signed" variant of A229037. Graphically, both sequences have similar ethereal features.
%C A293862 For any n > 0, |a(n)| <= floor( (n+1)/4 ).
