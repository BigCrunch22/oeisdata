%N A160513 Positive squarefree integers n such that, if n is the m-th squarefree integer (i.e., the m-th term of A005117), then n is also the m-th term of A000961 (the prime powers).
%C A160513 Is this sequence complete?
%C A160513 1 here is considered to be both the first squarefree integer and the first power of a prime.

%e A160513 If A005117(m) and A000961(m) are the same, a(n) is the m-th term.
%e A160513 For m = 1, A005117(m) and A000961(m) are both 1. a(1) = 1.
%e A160513 For m = 2, A005117(m) and A000961(m) are both 2. a(2) = 2.
%e A160513 For m = 3, A005117(m) and A000961(m) are both 3. a(3) = 3.
%e A160513 For m = 6, A005117(m) and A000961(m) are both 7. a(4) = 7.
%e A160513 For m = 12, A005117(m) and A000961(m) are both 17. a(5) = 17.
%e A160513 For m = 13, A005117(m) and A000961(m) are both 19. a(6) = 19.
