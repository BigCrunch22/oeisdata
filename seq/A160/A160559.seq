%N A160559 Minimal covering numbers.
%C A160559 A collection of congruences with distinct moduli, each greater than 1, such that each integer satisfies at least one of the congruences, is said to be a covering system. Let N be the LCM of these moduli. We consider minimal N's, i.e., N is the LCM of some moduli, but none of the divisors has this property.
%C A160559 Hough and Nielsen (2019) proved that each term must be divisible by 2 or 3. - _Max Alekseyev_, Nov 19 2022

%e A160559 80 is in the set since 1 mod 2; 2 mod 4; 4 mod 8; 8 mod 16; 4 mod 5; 8 mod 10; 16 mod 20, 32 mod 40; 0 mod 80 is a covering system with LCM 80. None of the divisors has that property.
%e A160559 36 is not minimal since 12 is a divisor and 12 is the LCM of a covering system.
