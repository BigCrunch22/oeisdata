%N A160408 Toothpick pyramid (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A160408 The toothpick pyramid is a three-dimensional version of the toothpick triangle A160406.
%C A160408 The sequence gives the number of toothpicks after n rounds. A160409 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th round.
%C A160408 See also the entry A139250 for more information about the toothpick sequences.
