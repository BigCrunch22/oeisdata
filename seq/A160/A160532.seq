%N A160532 Those positive integers n that contain runs of 0's and 1's that are each a power of 2 in length when n is represented in binary.
%C A160532 Let the binary representation of n be thought of as a string of 0's and 1's. By a "run" of 0's or 1's, it is meant either a contiguous substring all of 0's bounded by 1's or the by the edge of the string, or a contiguous substring all of 1's bounded by 0's or the by the edge of the string.
