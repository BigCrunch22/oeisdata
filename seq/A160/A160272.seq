%N A160272 Angle between the two hands of a 12 hour analog clock n*12 minutes after noon/midnight, measured in units of minutes.
%C A160272 The hour-hand movement is "quantized": the hour-hand has 60 "states" between minute-mark 0 and minute-mark 59; the minute hand is thus constrained to 12-minute steps.
%C A160272 The angle is defined as the smaller of the two angles, the one in the range 0 to 180 degrees. The sequence reverses at 06:00 (angle N=30 minutes), and recycles from N=0 at 12:00.
%C A160272 Other times can have any gap between 0 and 30 minutes, but they will not have the hour-hand precisely registered (e.g., 04:54:32.73 has a 30 minute gap, but the hour hand has moved off the 54th mark).
%F A160272 a(n) = A160278(n)/6.
%e A160272 00:00 has no gap between hands viewed normally (N=0); at 00:12, the minute hand points at the 12th minute-marking and the hour hand points at the 1st minute-marking (N=11).
%e A160272 At 00:36, the minute hand points at the 36th minute-marking and the hour hand points at the 3rd minute-marking, but N<>33, because the minimum gap is found clockwise: 24 +3 (N=27).
