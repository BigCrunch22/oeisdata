%N A160025 Primes p such that p^4 + 13^4 + 3^4 is prime.
%C A160025 For primes p, q, r the sum p^4 + q^4 + r^4 can be prime only if at least one of p, q, r equals 3. This sequence is the special case q = 13, r = 3.
%C A160025 It is conjectured that the sequence is infinite.
%C A160025 There are prime twins (11, 13) and other consecutive primes (421, 431; 1823, 1831) in the sequence.

%e A160025 p = 3: 3^4 + 13^4 + 3^4 = 28723 is prime, so 3 is in the sequence.
%e A160025 p = 5: 5^4 + 13^4 + 3^4 = 29267 = 7*37*113, so 5 is not in the sequence.
%e A160025 p = 17: 17^4 + 13^4 + 3^4 = 112163 is prime, so 17 is in the sequence.
%e A160025 p = 83: 83^4 + 13^4 + 3^4 = 47486963 is prime, so 83 is in the sequence.
