%N A160405 Primes that are the concatenation of a 5-digit prime, a 7-digit prime, and a 5-digit prime.
%C A160405 Haiku-haiku-haiku primes. I would like to call these "Haiku primes" but it seems that name has been used by _Geoffrey Caveney_ for a different concept. Another possible name would be haiku-formed primes, but maybe that should be reserved for primes which are formed from any number of primes of width 5 or 7. Note that if you associate the hyphens with the central word, Haiku-haiku-haiku is itself of the 5-7-5 form (in characters).

%e A160405 10007, 1000003, 10037, and 10007100000310037 are all prime, so 10007100000310037 is in the sequence.
