%N A160433 a(n) is the least number k such that (k-th prime after n!+1)-n! is not a prime.
%C A160433 The conjectures from A037153 and A087202 can be rephrased using a(n):
%C A160433 Is a(n)>=2 for all n>=0 and a(n)>=3 for all n>=2?
%C A160433 Also compare this with the conjecture on the fortunate numbers A005235.
%C A160433 Is the following true: for every m there is an N such that for all n>N a(n)>m?
%C A160433 There even seems to be the estimate a(n)>log(n+1)*sqrt(n+1)/2.
%e A160433 a(3)=7: The seven primes following 3!+1=7 are 11,13,17,19,23,29 and 31.
%e A160433 Subtracting 3!=6 from each of them gives 5,7,11,13,17,23 and 25.
%e A160433 The first six values are prime, while the seventh 25=5^2 is not.
