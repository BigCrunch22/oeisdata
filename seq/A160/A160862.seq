%N A160862 a(n) = length of period of transformation sum-digit-square: given a number m(k) define m(k+1) to be the sum of the squares of the decimal digits of m(k) and iterate until m(s) is found such that m(s)=m(k) with k<s. Numbers repeat periodically with a period of length a(n).
%D A160862 C. Suriano, Miniature Matematiche, unpublished, 2009, section 30
%e A160862 a(1)=1 since 1^2=1; a(2)=8 since the period contains 8 numbers: 4,16,37,58,89,145,42,20 the following being 4 again.
%e A160862 a(5)=11 since the sequence runs as follows:
%e A160862 25,29, 85, 89, 145, 42, 20, 4, 16, 37, 58 the next term being 89 that is already there.
