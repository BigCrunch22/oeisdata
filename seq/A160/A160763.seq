%C A160763 Proof that a(n) exists for all n: We will show that there is a prime p such that the sums of two or more divisors of p^(n-1) are all composite. Let Q be the product of the primes less than or equal to n. Let p be a prime of the form Qk+1. Observe that the divisors of p^(n-1), which are just powers of p, have the same form Qk+1 (but with different k, of course). Hence a sum of r of these powers will have the form Qk+r (for some k). Due to the way Q is constructed and r <= n, r and Q have a common factor, making Qk+r composite. Furthermore, by Dirichlet's theorem, we know there are an infinite number of primes p that will work for each n. [_T. D. Noe_, Jun 01 2009]
%C A160763 If a(14) < 2311^6*50821, then a(14) = p^6*q with primes p,q such that 139<=p<1000 and p^6 in A093893. - _Hagen von Eitzen_, Jun 03 2009
%C A160763 If a(14) < 2311^6*50821, then a(14) = p^6*q with p in {139,151,181,211,241} and q being prime. - _Max Alekseyev_, Sep 24 2015
