%N A160494 Least prime r > q such that the third-order cyclotomic polynomial Phi(pqr,x) is flat with p,q,r distinct odd primes, ordered by pq.
%C A160494 A flat polynomial is defined to be a polynomial whose coefficients are -1, 0, or 1. Sequence A046388 gives the product pq. As proved by Kaplan, given odd primes p < q, it is always possible to find a prime r > q such that Phi(pqr,x) is flat.
