%N A160992 a(1) = 1. For n >=2, a(n) = the smallest integer > a(n-1) such that sum{k=1 to r} a(k) doesn't equal any value of sum{k=1 to q} a(n+1-k), for any positive integer r, and for any positive integers q <= n-1.
%C A160992 The terms of this sequence were calculated by Hagen von EItzen.
%C A160992 sum{k=1 to q} a(n+1-k) obviously does equal sum{k=1 to r} a(k) for q = n = r.
