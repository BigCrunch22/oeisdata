%N A160901 a(n) = the smallest positive integer that is neither a multiple of c(n) nor is coprime to c(n), and is such that binary c(n) is a subsequence of a(n) written in binary; where c(n) = the n-th composite number.
%C A160901 Only composites indexes are considered here because there are no positive integers that are neither coprime to, nor a multiple of, the primes or 1.
