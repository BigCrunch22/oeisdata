%N A160350 Indices n=pqr of flat cyclotomic polynomials, where p<q<r are primes.
%C A160350 A polynomial is called flat iff it is of height 1, where the height is the largest absolute value of the coefficients.
%C A160350 A cyclotomic polynomial phi(n) is said of order 3 iff n=pqr with distinct (usually odd) primes p,q,r.
%C A160350 It is well known that phi(n) is flat if n has less than 3 odd prime factors, so this sequence includes all numbers of the form 2pq, with primes q>p>2, i.e. A075819. Sequence A117223 lists the complement, i.e. odd terms in this sequence, which start with 231 = 3*7*11.
%C A160350 Moreover, Kaplan shows that the present sequence also includes pqr if r = +-1 (mod pq). Sequence A160352 lists the subsequence of all such numbers, while A160354 lists elements which are not of this form.

%e A160350 a(1)=30=2*3*5 is the smallest product of three distinct primes, and Phi[30] = X^8 + X^7 - X^5 - X^4 - X^3 + X + 1 has only coefficients in {0,1,-1}.
%e A160350 a(19)=231=3*7*11 is the smallest odd product of three distinct primes p,q,r such that Phi[pqr] is flat.
