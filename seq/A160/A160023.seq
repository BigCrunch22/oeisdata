%N A160023 Primes p such that p^4 + 7^4 + 3^4 is prime.
%C A160023 For primes p, q, r the sum p^4 + q^4 + r^4 can be prime only if at least one of p, q, r equals 3. This sequence is the special case q = 7, r = 3.
%C A160023 It is conjectured that the sequence is infinite.
%C A160023 There are prime twins (6197, 6199) and other consecutive primes (409, 419; 2089, 2099) in the sequence.

%e A160023 p = 7: 7^4 + 7^4 + 3^4 = 4883 = 19*257, so 7 is not in the sequence.
%e A160023 p = 11: 11^4 + 7^4 + 3^4 = 17123 is prime, so 11 is in the sequence.
%e A160023 p = 101: 101^4 + 7^4 + 3^4 = 104062883 is prime, so 101 is in the sequence.
