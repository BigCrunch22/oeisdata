%N A160343 Numbers k such that the two closest numbers above and below k, which are in A010784 and which have no common digit with k, have the same distance to k.
%C A160343 For each integer k, define the smallest upper neighbor k+d with d > 0 such that k+d contains each digit at most once (see A010784) and has none of the digits of k. Define also the largest lower neighbor k-b with b > 0 such that k-b contains each digit at most once and has none of the digits of k.
%C A160343 The sequence consists of those k where d=b, that is, where these two neighbors are equidistant from k.
