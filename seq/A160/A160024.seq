%N A160024 Primes p such that p^4 + 11^4 + 3^4 is prime.
%C A160024 For primes p, q, r the sum p^4 + q^4 + r^4 can be prime only if at least one of p, q, r equals 3. This sequence is the special case q = 11, r = 3.
%C A160024 It is conjectured that the sequence is infinite.
%C A160024 There are prime twins (11, 13) and other consecutive primes (7, 11; 1093, 1097) in the sequence.

%e A160024 p = 3: 3^4 + 11^4 + 3^4 = 14803 = 113*131, so 3 is not in the sequence.
%e A160024 p = 7: 7^4 + 11^4 + 3^4 = 17123 is prime, so 7 is in the sequence.
%e A160024 p = 11: 11^4 + 11^4 + 3^4 = 29363 is prime, so 11 is in the sequence.
%e A160024 p = 13: 13^4 + 11^4 + 3^4 = 43283 is prime, so 13 is in the sequence.
