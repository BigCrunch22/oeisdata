%N A160642 Minimal number k such that n! can be written as product of k (>= 2) consecutive integers.
%C A160642 Sequence starts at n=2 because 1! cannot be written as product of 2 (or more) consecutive integers.
%C A160642 For suitable m >= n, we have n! = m!/(m-a(n))!
%C A160642 For n >= 3, we have a(n) <= n-1 because n! = 2*...*n.
%C A160642 For n = m! - 1, we have a(n) <= m!-m because n! = (m+1)*(m+2)*...*(m!-1)*m! = (n+1)!/m!.
%C A160642 For n>=8, it appears that the preceding two inequalities completely describe a(n), i.e. a(n) = m!-m if n=m!-1 and a(n)=n-1 otherwise.
%e A160642 a(2) = 2 because 2! = 1*2. a(3) = 2 because 3! = 2*3. a(4) = 3 because 4! = 2*3*4. a(5) = 3 because 5! = 4*5*6. a(6) = 3 because 6! = 8*9*10. a(7) = 4 because 7! = 7*8*9*10.
