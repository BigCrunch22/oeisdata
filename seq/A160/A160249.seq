%N A160249 Triangle of "less regular" face-centered-cubic sphere pack cuboctahedron numbers read by rows.
%C A160249 These solids each have 6 same rectangles, if one includes the first column (tetrahedra), where the rectangle is 1*(row number). They each have 2 tetrahedral quartets of same equilateral triangles, if one includes again the first column, for whom one or both quartets may be a single unit.
%C A160249 The first column is the series of tetrahedral numbers, (essentially A000292) and represents increasing edge length of one quartet of equilateral triangles. The column number represents the other quartet. The 2 quartet edges are interchangeable, because this triangle array is one half of a square table reflectable about the diagonal.
%C A160249 So the final column of each row represents a point where the 2 quartets' edge lengths are equal and the result is a regular cuboctahedron (A005902).
%C A160249 It seems remarkable that 24 of these shapes have even-hundred quantities of 10,000 or less, including 10,000 itself! This is far more than in any other figurate number series I've encountered. Additionally, 300 occurs twice, at 2,9 and 4,6 as does 9100, at 7,24 and 13,16. It suggests to me that this class of shapes may be useful in illustrating large numbers attractively.
