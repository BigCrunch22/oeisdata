%N A160278 Angle in degrees between the two hands of a 12-hour analog clock at 12*n minutes after noon/midnight.
%C A160278 The hour-hand movement is "quantized": the hour-hand has 60 "states" between minute-mark 0 and minute-mark 59; the minute hand is thus constrained to 12-minute steps.
%C A160278 The angle A is defined as the smaller of the two angles, the one reduced to the range from 0 to 180 degrees. The sequence reverses at 06:00 (A=180), and recycles from A=0 at 12:00.
%F A160278 a(n) = a(n-60), n >= 60 (24-hr period).
%F A160278 a(30-n) = a(30+n), 0 <= n <= 30 (reversal at 06:00).
%e A160278 00:00 has no angle between hands viewed normally (A=0); at 00:12, the minute hand points at the 12th minute-marking and the hour hand points at the 1st minute-marking (A=66); at 00:36, the minute hand points at the 36th minute-marking and the hour hand points at the 3rd minute-marking, but A <> 198, because the minimum gap is found clockwise from the minute hand: 144 + 18 (A=162).
%e A160278 Other times can have any gap between 0 and 180 degrees, but they will not have the hour-hand precisely registered (e.g., 04:54:32.73 has a 180 degree gap, but the hour hand has moved off the 54th mark).
