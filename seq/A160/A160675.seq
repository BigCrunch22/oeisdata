%N A160675 Duplication root: the maximal number of distinct squarefree words that a word of length n can be reduced to by iterated application of string-rewriting rules uu->u.
%C A160675 The growth is bounded by 1/30*110^(n/42) <= DupRoots(n) <= 2^n.
%C A160675 Duplication on strings was originally motivated by the fact that it occurs in DNA strands.

%e A160675 The shortest word with ambiguous root (up to reversal and renaming of letter) is
%e A160675 .abcbabcbc
%e A160675 which can be reduced to the words
%e A160675 .abc, abcbc, abcbabc, abcbabcbc
%e A160675 and of these only
%e A160675 .abc, abcbabc
%e A160675 are squarefree.
%e A160675 Witnesses for the value changes from 2 to 4 and from 4 to 5 are
%e A160675 .DUPROOT(abcbabcbcacbca) = (abcbabcacbca, abcbabca, abcacbca, abca).
%e A160675 .DUPROOT(ababcbabcacbabcabacbabcab) = (abcbabcabacbabcab, abcbabcab, abcacbabcab, abcabacbabcab, abcab).
%e A160675 Words with three roots exist, however, the first one is longer than the first one with four roots:
%e A160675 .DUPROOT(babacabacbcabacb) = (bacabacb, bacbcabacb, bacb).
