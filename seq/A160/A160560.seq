%N A160560 Almost minimal covering numbers
%C A160560 A collection of congruences with distinct moduli, each greater than 1, such that each integer satisfies at least one of the congruences, is said to be a covering system. Let N be the lcm of these moduli. If modulo N one number is uncovered then we speak about an almost minimal covering number.
%C A160560 We denote by T(N) the number of divisors of N. We denote by R(N) the number of uncovered numbers modulo N. Suppose N=p^k.M, where gcd(p,M)=1, p prime, R(M) = 1 and T(M) = p-1 then R(N) = 1 as well. R(p) = p-1.

%e A160560 30 is an almost minimal covering number since 1 mod 2; 2 mod 3; 4 mod 5; 4 mod 6; 8 mod 10; 12 mod 15 and 6 mod 30 covers all numbers modulo 30 except 30-folds.
