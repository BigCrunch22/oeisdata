%N A160355 Odd indices pqr of flat cyclotomic polynomials of order 3 which are not of the form r = +/-1 (mod pq).
%C A160355 This is in some sense the nontrivial part of A160350: Indeed, Kaplan (2007) has shown that Phi[pqr] has coefficients in {0,1,-1} if r = +-1 (mod pq), where p<q<r are primes. Here we list the odd elements of A160350 (i.e. of A117223) which do not satisfy this equality (i.e. which are not in A160353).

%F A160355 A160355 = A117223 \ A160353 = A160354 intersect A046389.
%e A160355 a(1)=231=3*7*11 is the smallest "nontrivial" element of A160350 in the sense that it is neither of the form 2pq, and that its largest factor (11) is not congruent to +- 1 modulo the product of the smaller factors (3*7).
