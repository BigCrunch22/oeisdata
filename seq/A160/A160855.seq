%N A160855 a(n) is the smallest positive integer not occurring earlier in the sequence such that Sum_{k=1..n} a(k) written in binary contains binary n as a substring.
%C A160855 Is this a permutation of the positive integers?
%C A160855 The smallest number not in {a(n) | n<=8000000} is 5083527. It appears that the quotient (a(1)+...+a(n))/n^2 meanders around between 1/2 (=perfect permutation) and 2/3: at n=8000000 the value is approximately 0.5866 (does it converge? 1/2? Golden ratio?).
%C A160855 The scatterplot of the first 100000 terms (see "graph") has some remarkable features which have not yet been explained. - _Leroy Quet_, Jul 05 2009
%C A160855 The lines that appear in the scatterplot seem to be related to the position of n in the sum of the first n terms; see colorized scatterplots in the Links section. - _Rémy Sigrist_, May 08 2017
