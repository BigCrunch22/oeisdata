%N A160804 Consider a permutation K = (k(1),k(2),...k(A000005(n))) of the positive divisors of n. Consider the partial sums S = Sum_{j=1..m} k(j), 1 <= m <= A000005(n). Then, a(n) = the minimum number, for any permutation K, of partial sums S that are coprime to n.
%e A160804 The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12. If the permutation K is, for example, (12,6,3,1,2,4), then the partial sums are: 12 = 12, 12+6 = 18, 12+6+3 = 21, 12+6+3+1 = 22, 12+6+3+1+2 = 24, and 12+6+3+1+2+4 = 28. None of these sums are coprime to 12, proving that the minimum number of partial sums coprime to 12 = a(12) = 0.
