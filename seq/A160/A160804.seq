%N A160804 Consider a permutation K = (k(1),k(2),...k(A000005(n))) of the positive divisors of n. Consider the partial sums S= sum{j=1 to m} k(j), 1<=m<=A000005(n). Then, a(n) = the minimum number, for any permutation K, of partial sums S that are coprime to n.
%e A160804 The divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. If the permutation K is, for example, (12,6,3,1,2,4), then the partial sums are: 12=12, 12+6=18, 12+6+3=21, 12+6+3+1=22, 12+6+3+1+2=24, and 12+6+3+1+2+4=28. None of these sums are coprime to 12, proving that the minimum number of partial sums coprime to 12 = a(12) = 0.
