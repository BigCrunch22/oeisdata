%N A160095 Terms n > 1 of A001065, sorted.
%C A160095 Term 1 occurs infinitely often in A001065, therefore terms <= 1 are excluded.
%C A160095 n occurs in the present sequence with multiplicity A048138(n).
%e A160095 6 occurs twice in the present sequence because there are two numbers m, viz. 6 and 25, for which A001065(m) = 6.
