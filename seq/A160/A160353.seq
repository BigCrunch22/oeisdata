%N A160353 Numbers of the form p*q*r, where p < q < r are odd primes such that r = +/-1 (mod p*q).
%C A160353 Kaplan (2007) has shown that this is a subsequence of A117223 (and thus of A160350; see there for the reference), i.e., the cyclotomic polynomial phi(n) has coefficients in {0,1,-1} for indices n listed here.
%C A160353 This is a subsequence of A160352 which drops the requirement that p > 2.

%e A160353 a(1) = 435 = 3*5*29 is the smallest product of odd primes p < q < r such that r is congruent to +/- 1 modulo the product of the smaller factors, p*q.
