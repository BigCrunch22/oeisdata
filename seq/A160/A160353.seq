%N A160353 Numbers of the form pqr, where p<q<r are odd primes such that r = +/-1 (mod pq).
%C A160353 Kaplan (2007) has shown that this is a subsequence of A117223 (and thus of A160350; see there for the reference), i.e. the cyclotomic polynomial phi(n) has coefficients in {0,1,-1} for indices n listed here.
%C A160353 This is a subsequence of A160352 which drops the requirement p>2.
%C A160353 See A160350 for further details and references.
%e A160353 a(1)=435=3*5*29 is the smallest product of odd primes p<q<r such that r is congruent to +/- 1 modulo the product of the smaller factors, p*q.
