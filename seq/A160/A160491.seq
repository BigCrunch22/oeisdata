%N A160491 First differences of A062481.
%C A160491 a(1), a(3) and a(6) are the only primes found for n up to 10000 using The C/Gmp program in the link which is 17 times faster than the PARI routine. We read large blocks of primes into memory and test in memory.
%C A160491 If another prime exists, it is larger than 418977 digits.
%C A160491 A concept of order can be introduced here by researching and analyzing the next-nextprime, next-next-nextprime etc.

%F A160491 a(n) = A062481(n+1) - A062481(n).
%e A160491 For n = 3, 4^7 - 3^3 = 16141, the 3rd entry in the sequence.
%o A160491 (PARI) ppower(n) = { for(x=1,n, y=(x+1)^prime(x+1)-x^prime(x); print1(y",") ); }
