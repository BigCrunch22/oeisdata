%N A160770 Triangle in which row n is generated from (1,3,6,10,...n) dot (n,n-1,...1) with subtractive carryovers.
%C A160770 Row sums = A005995: (1, 3, 12, 28, 66, 126, 236,...); also generated from:
%C A160770 (1/2)*((1, 6, 21, 56, 126,...)+(1, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 10,...)); where (1, 6, 21,...) = bin(n,5).
%C A160770 A177878 = the analogous sequence using vector (1,2,3,...).
%F A160770 The subtractive carryover dot product of two vectors (a(1),a(2),...a(n)) dot (b(1),b(2),..b(n)) = (c(1),..,c(n)) is defined by c(1)=a(1)*b(1) and c(i) = a(i)*b(i)-c(i-1), i>1; where the vector = the triangular series.
