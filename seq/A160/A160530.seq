%N A160530 Positive integers that contain only odd-length runs of 0's and 1's in their binary expansion.
%C A160530 Let the binary representation of n be thought of as a string of 0's and 1's. By a "run" of 0's or 1's, it is meant either a contiguous substring all of 0's bounded by 1's or the by the edge of the string, or a contiguous substring all of 1's bounded by 0's or the by the edge of the string.
%C A160530 Also, the indices of the compositions that have only odd parts. For the definition of the index of a composition see A298644. For example, 263 is in the sequence since its binary form is 100000111 and the composition [1,5,3] has only odd parts. 132 is not in the sequence since its binary form is 10000100 and the composition [1,4,1,2] also has even parts. The command c(n) from the Maple program yields the composition having index n. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Jan 26 2018
%C A160530 From _Robert Israel_, Jan 26 2018: (Start)
%C A160530 An even number n is in the sequence if and only if n = 2^k*m where k is odd and m is an odd number in the sequence.
%C A160530 An odd number n is in the sequence if and only if n = 2^k*(m+1)-1 where k is odd and m is 0 or an even number in the sequence. (End)
