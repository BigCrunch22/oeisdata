%N A160504 a(n) = number of ordered pairs (i,j) such that a(i)+a(j)<n, i<j<n; a(1)=a(2)=1.
%C A160504 It appears that the longest run of identical values in the sequence has length five, occurring twice: a(69) = ... = a(73) = 239 and a(81) = ... = a(85) = 282. Length four appears once at a(13) = ... = a(16) = 21. The last adjacent pair with equal values appears to be a(340) = a(341) = 2558; checked through n=1000. - _Hartmut F. W. Hoft_, Jun 04 2017

%e A160504 a(3) = 1 because there is only one possible pair of previous terms, {1, 1}, and its sum is 2, which is less than 3.
%e A160504 a(4) = 3 because there are three possible pairs of previous terms {a(1), a(2)}, {a(1), a(3)}, {a(2), a(3)}, which are here considered distinct even though they all work out to {1, 1} with a sum of 2, which is less than 4.
%e A160504 a(5) = 6 because there are six possible pairs of previous terms: {a(1), a(2)}, {a(1), a(3)}, {a(1), 3}, {a(2), a(3)}, {a(2), 3}, {a(3), 3}, with sums 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 4, respectively, all of which are less than 6.
