%N A160179 a(1)=2. a(n) equals the product of the previous terms divided by the (n-1)st prime gap.
%C A160179 Start with a(1)=2. Build a(n) as the product of all preceding terms divided by the n-minus-first prime gap. The sequence is limited to 9 terms because the 10th term is no longer an integer.
%F A160179 a(1) =2. a(n) = product_{i=1..n-1} a(i) / A001223(n-1), n>1.
%e A160179 a(8) = 2*2*2*4*8*128*8192/2 = 134217728.
