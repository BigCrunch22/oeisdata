%N A142972 a(n) = the largest integer such that each positive integer <= a(n) divides at least one integer k, where the n-th prime <= k <= the (n+1)th prime.
%C A142972 a(n) = A142973(n) - 1.
%e A142972 The 15th prime is 47 and the 16th prime is 53. So we will consider the integers 47,48,49,50,51,52,53. Now, 1 divides each of these 6 integers. 2 divides 48, 50 and 52. 3 divides 48 and 51. 4 divides 48 and 52. 5 divides 50. 6 divides 48. 7 divides 49. 8 divides 48. But 9 does not divide any integer that is between 47 and 53. So a(15)=8, since 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 each divide at least one integer between 47 and 53.
