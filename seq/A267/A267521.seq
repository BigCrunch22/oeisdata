%N A267521 Integers whose base-10 representation (Bm,...,B1,B0) is such that the polynomial f(x) = B0 + B1*x + ... + Bm*x^m is irreducible over the ring of integers, 0 <= Bi <= 9.
%F A267521 Integers in A000027 but not in A267509.
%e A267521 11 is a member as f(x) = B0 + B1*x = 1 + 1*x has no factorization other than the trivial one, i.e., 1*(1+x), hence f(x) is irreducible over the ring of integers.
%e A267521 114 is a member as f(x) = B0 + B1*x + B2*x^2 = 4 + 1*x + 1*x^2 = 4 + x + x^2 is irreducible over the ring of integers.
