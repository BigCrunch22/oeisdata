%N A267970 Conjectured list of positive numbers n such that the Collatz-like map T: if x > 1 and x odd, x -> 5*x+1 and, if x even, x -> x/2, when started at n, never repeats.
%C A267970 A companion to A232711 (which conjecturally lists the numbers whose trajectory reaches 1), and A267969 (which conjecturally lists the numbers whose trajectory cycles but does not reach 1). The present sequences conjecturally lists the numbers whose trajectory diverges.
%C A267970 The numbers listed have trajectories that have not cycled in the first 10000 steps. (But this does not mean much. There are quite small numbers that only cycle after 13000 iterations. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 23 2016)
