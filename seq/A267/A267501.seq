%N A267501 Relative of Hofstadter Q-sequence: a(n) = 0 if n <= 0, a(1) = a(2) = a(3) = 1; a(n) = a(n-a(n-1)) + a(n-a(n-2)) + a(n-a(n-3)) for n > 3.
%C A267501 This sequence has exactly 416 terms.  a(416) = 0, so an attempt to calculate a(417) would refer to itself.
%C A267501 Without the convention that a(n) = 0 for n <= 0, this sequence would have exactly five terms, since computing a(6) refers to a(-1).

%e A267501 a(10) = 4 because a(9) is 10, a(8) is 8, and a(7) is 3, so we take a(10 - 10) + a(10 - 8) + a(10 - 3) = a(0) + a(2) + a(7) = 0 + 1 + 3 = 4.
