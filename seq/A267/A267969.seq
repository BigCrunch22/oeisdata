%N A267969 Conjectured list of positive numbers k such that the Collatz-like map T: if x > 1 and x odd, x -> 5*x+1 and, if x even, x -> x/2, when started at k, eventually reaches a cycle that does not contain 1 (cf. A232711).
%C A267969 A companion to A232711 (which conjecturally lists the numbers whose trajectory reaches 1), and A267970 (which conjecturally lists the numbers whose trajectory diverges).
%C A267969 This is conjectural in that there is no proof that the list is complete as far as it goes. Some of the terms in A267970 could belong to A232711 or this sequence if the trajectory is extended far enough. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 23 2016
%C A267969 It appears that the trajectories of all terms in this sequence reach one of two length 10 loops, one containing 13 and the other 17. This has been checked for terms up to 10^4 assuming trajectories with more than 10000 odd terms are infinite and also up to 10^6 assuming trajectories with more than 1000 odd terms are infinite. - _Gary Detlefs_, Jan 25 2022
