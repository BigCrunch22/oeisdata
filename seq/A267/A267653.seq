%N A267653 Number of unlabeled, connected graphs on n vertices which have no induced subgraph isomorphic to an R-graph.
%C A267653 The R-graph has 6 vertices. 4 vertices form a cycle and both the other two vertices are adjacent to a single one of those 4.
%H A267653 F. Hüffner, <a href="https://github.com/falk-hueffner/tinygraph">tinygraph</a>, software for generating integer sequences based on graph properties, version e8699da.
%Y A267653 Cf. A079570, the same for the cricket graph (like an R-graph, but with a triangle instead of a 4-cycle).
