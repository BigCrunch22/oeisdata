%N A267296 Circulant Ramsey numbers RC_1(3,n) of the first kind.
%C A267296 The smallest positive number a(n), such that any triangle-free cyclic (also known as circulant) graph with a(n) vertices has independence number at least n. The terminology and the terms given here are from Harborth and Krause.
%C A267296 a(n) <= A267295(n) for all n.
%C A267296 Moreover, the sequence is related to the ordinary two-color Ramsey numbers R(3,n), given in A000791, by the relation a(n) <= A000791(n) for all n, as proved by Kalbfleisch. This inequality is known to be an equality for n = 2 or 4 <= n <= 5.
