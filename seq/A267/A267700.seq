%N A267700 "Tree" sequence in a 90-degree sector of the cellular automaton of A160720.
%C A267700 Conjecture: this is also the "tree" sequence in a 120-degree sector of the cellular automaton of A266532.
%C A267700 It appears that this is also the partial sums of A038573.
%C A267700 a(n) is also the total number of ON cells after n-th stage in the tree that arises from one of the four spokes in a 90-degree sector of the cellular automaton A160720 on the square grid.
%C A267700 Note that the structure of A160720 is also the "outward" version of the Ulam-Warburton cellular automaton of A147562.
%C A267700 It appears that A038573 gives the number of cells turned ON at n-th stage.
%C A267700 Conjecture: a(n) is also the total number of Y-toothpicks after n-th stage in the tree that arises from one of the three spokes in a 120-degree sector of the cellular automaton of A266532 on the triangular grid.
%C A267700 Note that the structure of A266532 is also the "outward" version of the Y-toothpick cellular automaton of A160120.
%C A267700 It appears that A038573 also gives the number of Y-toothpicks added at n-th stage.
%C A267700 Comment from _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 23 2016: All the above conjectures are true!
%C A267700 From _Gus Wiseman_, Mar 31 2019: (Start)
%C A267700 a(n) is also the number of nondecreasing binary-containment pairs of positive integers up to n. A pair of positive integers is a binary containment if the positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of the first are a subset of the positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of the second. For example, the a(1) = 1 through a(6) = 12 pairs are:
%C A267700   (1,1)  (1,1)  (1,1)  (1,1)  (1,1)  (1,1)
%C A267700          (2,2)  (1,3)  (1,3)  (1,3)  (1,3)
