%N A267295 Circulant Ramsey numbers RC_2(3,n) of the second kind.
%C A267295 The smallest number a(n), such that any triangle-free cyclic (also known as circulant) graph with at least a(n) vertices has independence number at least n. The terminology and the terms given here are from Harborth and Krause (2003); however, in another form, essentially they were considered and partly calculated already by Kalbfleich in 1965.
%C A267295 a(n) = A000789(n)+1 and a(n) >= A267296(n) for all n.
%C A267295 Moreover, the sequence is related to the ordinary two-color Ramsey numbers R(3,n), given in A000791, by the relation a(n) <= A000791(n) for all n, as proved by Kalbfleisch. This inequality is known to be strict for 6 <= n <= 8, and for n = 10.
