%N A267371 Limiting sequence formed by starting with 01 and iteratively concatenating existing string with the shortest prefix that appears only once
%e A267371 Starting with 01, the shortest prefix occurring only once is 0, so the next string is (01)(0) = 010.  After that it becomes (010)(01) = 01001, etc.
