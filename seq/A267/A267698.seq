%N A267698 Q-toothpick sequence in the first quadrant starting with two Q-toothpicks centered at (1,3) and (3,1) respectively. The endpoints of the left hand Q-toothpick are at (0,3) and (1,4). The endpoints of the right hand Q-toothpick are at (3,0) and (4,1). With a(0) = 0.
%C A267698 a(n) is the total number of Q-toothpicks in the structure after n-th stage.
%C A267698 A267699 (the first differences) gives the number of Q-toothpicks added at n-th stage.
%C A267698 Note that this sequence is also related with the structure and the formula of A187210. For more information see A187210, A267694 and A139250.
