%N A267510 Integers in A267509 such that (B0 + B1 + ... + Bm) is congruent to 0 mod m.
%C A267510 If Bi is congruent to 0 mod m for all i=1,2,...,m then the integer n = (Bm,...,B1,B0) is a member of this sequence if and only if n is a member of A267509.
%e A267510 22 is a term, as f(x)=B0+B1x=2+2x=2*(1+x)=g(x)*h(x) with g(x)=2, h(x)=1+x, and neither g(x) nor h(x) is a unit in the ring of integers implies that f(x) is reducible over the ring of integers and 2+2=4=0 mod 1.
%e A267510 121 is a term, as f(x)=B0+B1x+B2x^2=1+2x+1x^2=1+2x+x^2=(1+x)*(1+x)=g(x)*h(x) with g(x)=1+x=h(x) and neither g(x) nor h(x) is a unit in the ring of integers implies that f(x) is reducible over the ring of integers and 1+2+1=4=0 mod 2.
