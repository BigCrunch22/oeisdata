%N A267013 Number of distinct digital types of n-digit primes in base 10.
%C A267013 The sequence is related to A266991.
%C A267013 Sequence {A164864(n) - a(n)}_(n>=1) begins 0,0,1,4,1,26,1,175,365,1516,...
%C A267013 One can explain, why, for example, a(4)=11, instead of A164864(4)=15. There exist exactly 4 types of 4-digit numbers, which cannot be prime. In A266946 these types are: 1001, 1010, 1100, 1111. Indeed, numbers abba,aabb,aaaa are divisible by 11; a number abab is divisible by 101.
%C A267013 In other cases of n-digit types we should verify the divisibility of numbers of types in A266946 at least by primes of the form 11,101,... Besides, a digital type 1...1 exists only for n in A004023, i.e., for  only 9 values of n from the first 270343. This simplifies the calculations.
%Y A267013 Cf. A164864, A164904, A264406, A266946.
