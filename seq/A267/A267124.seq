%N A267124 Primitive practical numbers: practical numbers that are squarefree or practical numbers that when divided by any of its prime factors whose factorization exponent is greater than 1 is no longer practical.
%C A267124 If n is a practical number and d is any of its divisors then n*d must be practical. Consequently the sequence of all practical numbers must contain members that are either squarefree (A265501) or when divided by any of its prime factors whose factorization exponent is greater than 1 is no longer practical. Such practical numbers are said to be primitive. The set of all practical numbers can be generated from the set of primitive practical numbers by multiplying these primitives by any of their divisors.
%C A267124 Conjecture: every odd number, beginning with 3, is the sum of a prime number and a primitive practical number. This is a tighter conjecture to the conjecture posed by _Hal M. Switkay_ (see A005153).

%e A267124 a(4)=20=2^2*5. It is a practical number because it has 6 divisors 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20 that form a complete sequence. If it is divided by 2 the resultant has 4 divisors 1, 2, 5, 10 that is not a complete sequence.
%e A267124 a(7)=42=2*3*7. It is squarefree and is practical because it has 8 divisors 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42 that form a complete sequence.
