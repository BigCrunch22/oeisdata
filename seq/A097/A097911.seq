%N A097911 Minimal order of a graph containing as induced subgraphs isomorphic copies of all graphs on n unlabeled nodes.
%C A097911 A graph that contains as induced subgraphs isomorphic copies of all graphs in a family F is called induced universal for F. - _James Trimble_, Nov 09 2021
%C A097911 16 <= a(7) <= 18 (Trimble, 2021). - _James Trimble_, Nov 09 2021
