%N A097104 Start with positive integers in order. At m-th iteration, let a(k) become a(k-1) for m+1<=k<=p_m and let a(m) become a(p_m), where p_m is the m-th prime. Record the limiting sequence.
%C A097104 n-th term of limit-sequence is determined at the n-th iteration.
%C A097104 It is interesting to notice that 5 is moved from the fifth position to the 400th position and that the only triple is 2,3,4.
