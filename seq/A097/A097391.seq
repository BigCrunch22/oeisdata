%e A097391 Let : denote the separation between two subhierarchies, e.g. 2:3 are two subhierarchies where subhierarchy s=1 contains two elements and subhierarchy s=2 contains three elements. Let | denote the separation between two levels, e.g. 2|2|1 is a hierarchy composed of three levels with two elements on levels l=1 and l=2 and one element on level l=3. For n=5 one has a(5) = 17 hierarchies where at least one subhierarchy has exactly 2 levels (and no level l > 2 is allowed):
