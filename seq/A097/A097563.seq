%N A097563 Least integer that can be written as a sum of zero or more distinct squares in exactly n ways, or -1 if no such number exists.
%C A097563 a(n) = -1 for almost all n. Conjecture: for n > 34189857569982621, this sequence is the integers > 37163, in order, interspersed with -1s. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Sep 04 2015

%e A097563 a(4) = 65 because we can write 65 as a sum of distinct squares in four ways: 65 = 8^2 + 1^2 = 7^2 + 4^2 = 6^2 + 5^2 + 2^2 = 6^2 + 4^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 and we cannot do this with any smaller integer.
%e A097563 a(0) = 2 because we cannot write 2 as a sum of distinct squares and it is the smallest number with this property.
