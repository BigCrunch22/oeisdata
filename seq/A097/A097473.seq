%N A097473 Slowest ever increasing sequence in which all successive digits are the digits of the Fibonacci sequence.
%C A097473 May be considered as two sequences hidden in each other: the digits of Fibonacci are hidden in this sequence; the digits of this sequence are hidden in the Fibonacci. Same comment for A098080 and the counting numbers.
%F A097473 Write down the Fibonacci sequence and consider it as a unique succession of digits. Divide up into chunks of minimal length (and not beginning with 0) so that chunks are increasing numbers in order to form the slowest ever increasing sequences of slices (disregarding the number of digits) of the succession of the digits of the Fibonacci sequence.
%Y A097473 Cf. A000045, A098080.
