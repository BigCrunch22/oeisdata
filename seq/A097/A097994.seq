%N A097994 T(n,k) counts plane partitions of n that can be 'extended' in (k+2) ways to a plane partition of n+1 by adding 1 element to it. Equivalently, it counts how many partitions of n have (k+2) different partitions of n+1 just covering it.
%C A097994 The first column starts a t k=3 since all plane partitions can be extended in at least 3 ways. Row sums are A000219 by definition. Sum T(n,k) (k+2) =A090984.
%e A097994 T(4,4)=1 because {{2,1},{1}} is the only plane partition of 4 that can be extended in 4+2 = 6 ways to a plane partition of 5.
