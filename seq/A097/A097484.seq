%N A097484 Write the odd positive integers on labels in numerical order, forming an infinite sequence L. Consider the succession of single digits of L: 1 3 5 7 9 1 1 1 3 1 5 1 7 1 9 2 1 2 3 2 5 2 7 2 9 3 1 ... (A031312). This sequence is a derangement of L that produces the same succession of digits, subject to the constraint that the smallest unused label must be used that does not lead to a contradiction.
%C A097484 Derangement here means the n-th element of L is not the n-th element of this sequence, so a(n) != 2n - 1.
%e A097484 We must begin with 1,3,5,7... and we cannot have a(1) = 1, so the next possibility is the label "13". The next term must be the smallest available label not leading to a contradiction, thus "5". The next one will be "7", etc. After the label "9" the smallest available label is "1". After this "1" we cannot have a(6) = 11 -- we thus take the smallest available label which is "113". No label is allowed to start with a leading zero.
