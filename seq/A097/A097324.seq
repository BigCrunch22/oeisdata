%N A097324 Numbers n such that A067655(n) is different from A049606(n).
%C A097324 Or, denominator of 2^n/n! differs from denominator of sum(k=1,n,C(n-1,k-1)*2^k/k!).
%C A097324 We conjecture that the sequence is infinite, the sequence and its complement (cases where the two values are equal) equipartition N and the difference between consecutive members of this sequence never exceeds c=7.
