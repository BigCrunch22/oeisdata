%N A097481 Write the positive even integers on labels in numerical order, forming an infinite sequence L. Consider the succession of digits of L: 2 4 6 8 1 0 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 2 0 2 2 2 4 2 6 2 8 3 0 ... (A036211). This sequence gives a derangement of L that produces the same succession of digits, subject to the constraint that the smallest unused label must be used that does not lead to a contradiction.
%C A097481 Derangement here means the n-th element of L is not the n-th element of this sequence, so a(n) != 2n.
%e A097481 We must begin with 2,4,6,8,... and we cannot have a(1) = 2, so the first possibility is the label "24". The next term must be the smallest available label not leading to a contradiction, thus "6". The next one will be "8", etc. After the label "20" the smallest available label is "2". After this "2" we cannot have a(11) = 22 -- we thus take the smallest available label which is "224". No label is allowed to start with a leading zero.
