%N A097231 Number of solutions (excluding rotations and reflections) for a series of 9 consecutive primes beginning with the n-th prime arranged in a 3 X 3 square such that all row, column and diagonal totals are primes.
%C A097231 To get the total number of solutions including rotations and reflections, multiply a(n) by 8.
%e A097231 a(1) = 0 because there is no 3 X 3 square arrangement of the primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 and 29 such that all row, column and diagonal totals are primes. a(2) = 116 because there are 116 unique 3 X 3 square arrangements of the primes 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 and 29 such that all row, column and diagonal totals are primes. Here is one solution counted by a(2):
