%N A097488 Write the positive multiples of 3 on labels in numerical order, forming an infinite sequence L. Now consider the succession of single digits of L: 3 6 9 1 2 1 5 1 8 2 1 2 4 2 7 3 0 3 3 3 6 3 9 4 2 .... This sequence is a derangement of L that produces the same succession of digits, subject to the constraint that the smallest unused label must be used that does not lead to a contradiction.
%C A097488 This could be roughly rephrased like this: Rewrite in the most economical way the "multiples-of-3 pattern" using only multiples of 3, but rearranged. No term in the sequence can appear more than once.
%C A097488 Derangement here means the n-th element of L is not the n-th element of this sequence, so a(n) != 3n.
%e A097488 We must begin with 3,6,9,12,... and we cannot have a(1) = 3, so the first possibility is the label "36". The next term must be the smallest available label not leading to a contradiction, thus "9". The next one will be "12", etc. After the label "30" the smallest available label is "3". After this "3" we cannot have a(11) = 33 -- we thus take the smallest available label which is "336". No label is allowed to start with a leading zero. - _Eric Angelini_, Aug 12 2008
