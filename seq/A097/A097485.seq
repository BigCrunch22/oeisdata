%N A097485 Write the positive integers on labels in numerical order, forming an infinite sequence L. Consider now the succession of single digits made by juxtaposing Fibonacci numbers: 1 1 2 3 5 8 1 3 2 1 3 4 5 5 ... (A031324). This sequence gives a derangement of L that produces the same succession of digits, subject to the constraint that the smallest unused label must be used that does not lead to a contradiction.
%C A097485 Labels of L can be used only once in this sequence.
%C A097485 We could name this sequence the "Fibo_nat_cci" sequence (_nat_ stands for "natural numbers").
%C A097485 Derangement here means the n-th term of L is not the n-th term of the sequence, so a(n) != n.
%e A097485 We must begin with 1,1,2,3,... and we cannot have a(1) = 1, so the next possibility is the label "11". After "68" we must get "7,5,0,2,5,1,2,1,3,9,3,1,9,6,4,1,8..." (corresponding to Fibonacci numbers "75025,121393,196418..."); "7" is already used, and we cannot use "75" since no label begins with a 0. So the next term is "750".
