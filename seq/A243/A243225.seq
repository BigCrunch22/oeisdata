%N A243225 Numbers which are not the sum of positive integers in an arithmetic progression with common difference 3.
%C A243225 Also numbers which are not of the form n = (r+1)(2a+3r)/2 for any positive integers r and a >= 1.
%C A243225 Except a(3) = 3, these are the powers of 2 and the products of a power of two 2^k with an odd prime p such that 1+2^(k+1)/3 <= p <= 3(2^(k+1)-1). For example, 20 is in the sequence as 20 = 2^2*5 and 1+2^3/3 <= 5 <= 3(2^3-1).
%C A243225 The equivalent sequence for arithmetic progressions with a common difference of 2 is A000040, the prime numbers (i.e., the numbers > 1 which are not sum of positive integers in arithmetic progression with a common difference 2 are exactly the primes).
