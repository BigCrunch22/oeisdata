%N A243937 Even numbers n>=6 for which lpf(n-1) > lpf(n-3), where lpf = least prime factor.
%C A243937 Complement of A245024 over even n >= 6.
%C A243937 Conjecture: All differences are 2, 4 or 6 such that there are no two consecutive terms 2 (..., 2, 2, ...), no two consecutive terms 4, while consecutive terms 6 occur 1, 2, 3 or 4 times; also consecutive pairs of terms 2, 4 appear 1, 2, 3 or 4 times. The conjecture is verified up to n = 2.5*10^7. - _Vladimir Shevelev_ and _Peter J. C. Moses_, Jul 11 2014
%C A243937 Divisibility by 3 means 6m is in the sequence for all m > 0, and 6m + 4 never is, while 6m + 2 is undetermined. Divisibility by 5 means 30m + 8 is always in the sequence, and 30m + 26 never is. This proves the above conjecture. - _Jens Kruse Andersen_, Aug 19 2014
%C A243937 Note that,
%C A243937 1) Since numbers of the form 6*k evidently are in the sequence, then the counting function of the terms not exceeding x is not less than x/6.
%C A243937 2) Sequence {a(n)-1} contains all primes greater than 3 in the natural order. The subsequence of other terms of {a(n)-1} is 35, 65, 77, 95, ... - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Jul 15 2014
