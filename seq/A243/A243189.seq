%N A243189 Nonnegative numbers of the form 2x^2 + 6xy - 3y^2.
%C A243189 Discriminant 60.
%C A243189 Nonnegative numbers of the form 5x^2 - 3y^2. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Jun 03 2022
%C A243189 From _Klaus Purath_, Jul 26 2023: (Start)
%C A243189 Nonnegative integers k such that 3x^2 - 5y^2 + k = 0 has integer solutions.
%C A243189 Also nonnegative integers of the form 2x^2 + (4m+2)xy + (2m^2+2m-7)y^2 for integers m. This includes the form in the name with m = 1.
%C A243189 Also nonnegative integers of the form 5x^2 + 10mxy + (5m^2-3)y^2 for integers m. This includes the form from Jon E. Schoenfield above with m = 0.
%C A243189 There are no squares in this sequence. Even powers of terms as well as products of an even number of terms belong to A243188.
%C A243189 Odd powers of terms as well as products of an odd number of terms belong to the sequence. This can be proved with respect to the form 5x^2 - 3y^2 by the following identity: (na^2 - kb^2)(nc^2 - kd^2)(ne^2 - kf^2) = n[a(nce + kdf) + bk(cf + de)]^2 - k[na(cf + de) + b(nce + kdf)]^2 for all a, b, c, d, e, f, k, n in R. This can be verified by expanding both sides of the equation.
