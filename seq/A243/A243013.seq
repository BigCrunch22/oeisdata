%N A243013 Number of graphs with n vertices and n-1 edges that can be gracefully labeled.
%C A243013 Hand calculated by grade 3 students up to term 6: (1,1,1,3,5,12...)
%e A243013 a(5) = 5: A001433 tells us that there are 6 simple graphs with 5 vertices and 4 edges.  Only 5 of these can be labeled gracefully.  The one that cannot is the triangular loop plus two connected nodes: âˆ† / .
%Y A243013 A001433 provides an upper bound. If the Graceful Tree Conjecture were true, A000055 would be a lower bound.
