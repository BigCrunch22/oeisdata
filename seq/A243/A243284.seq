%N A243284 a(n) = the number of distinct ways of writing such products m = k^2 * j, 0 < j <= k, (j and k natural numbers) that m is in range [1,n]; Partial sums of A102354.
%C A243284 a(n) = the number of distinct ways of writing such products m = k^2 * j, 0 < j <= k, (j and k natural numbers) that m is in range [1,n].
%C A243284 Different ways to write product for the same m are counted separately, e.g. for 64, both 8^2 * 1 and 4^2 * 4 are counted, so a(64) = a(63)+2 = 13+2 = 15.
%C A243284 Differs from A243283 for the first time at n=48, where a(48)=11, while A243283(48)=10. This is because 48 = 2*2*2*2*3 is the first integer which can be represented in the form k^2 * j, 0 < j <= k (namely as 48 = 4^2 * 3), even though it is not a member of A070003.
%Y A243284 Partial sums of A102354.
