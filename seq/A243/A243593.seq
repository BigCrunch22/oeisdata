%N A243593 Primes giving record values of f(n) = (2*Sum_{i=1..n}(i*prime(i)) / Sum_{i=1..n}(prime(i))-(n+1))/(n-1).
%C A243593 Is the sequence finite? It would mean that the value of f(n) would become monotonic after inclusion of the largest prime in the sequence.
%C A243593 It should be easy to prove that the value of lim 3*f(n) is 1 when n approaches infinity.
%C A243593 The generalized formula 3*(2*sum_XY/sum_Y - (n+1))/(n-1) is a non-linear correlation coefficient between the X (1,2,3...) and the nonnegative Y values, with range from -3 to +3, and linear correlation still giving value 1 or -1.
%C A243593 What is the next term after 32057?
