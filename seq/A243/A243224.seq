%N A243224 Number of odd divisors d of n such that d > 1 and d(1+d/3)/2 <= n <= 3d(d-1)/2.
%C A243224 This sequence is useful for computing A243223, the number of partitions of n into summands in arithmetic progression with common difference 3. The definition follows Nyblom and Evans 2003 (see LINK) with slight modifications and corrections.
