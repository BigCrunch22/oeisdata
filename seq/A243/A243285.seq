%N A243285 Number of integers 1 <= k <= n which are not divisible by the square of their largest noncomposite divisor.
%C A243285 a(n) tells how many natural numbers <= n there are which are not divisible by the square of their largest noncomposite divisor.
%C A243285 The largest noncomposite divisor of 1 is 1 itself, and 1 is divisible by 1^2, thus 1 is not included in the count, and a(1)=0.
%C A243285 The "largest noncomposite divisor" for any integer > 1 means the same thing as the largest prime divisor, and thus we are counting the terms of A102750 (Numbers n such that square of largest prime dividing n does not divide n).
%C A243285 Thus this is the partial sums of the characteric function for A102750.

%F A243285 a(n) = n - A243283(n).
%F A243285 For all n, a(A102750(n)) = n, thus this sequence works also as an inverse function for the injection A102750.
%e A243285 For n = 9, there are numbers 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 which are not divisible by the square of their largest prime factor, while 1 is excluded (no prime factors) and 4 and 8 are divisible both by 2^2 and 9 is divisible by 3^2. Thus a(9) = 5.
