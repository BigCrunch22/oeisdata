%N A243359 Number of steps it takes the terms in A029742 and their reversals to reach the value 9 when the smaller term is successively subtracted from the larger term.
%C A243359 Sequence appears to be periodic with period 10, although I don't have a proof for this property.
%C A243359 If the successive subtraction algorithm is applied to the terms of A002113, the resulting value is always 0 after one iteration, therefore only the values resulting from the terms of that sequence's complement A029742 are taken into account for this sequence.
%e A243359 For 14: 41 - 14 = 27 --> 72 - 27 = 45 --> 54 - 45 = 9 takes three steps to reach 9, therefore a(4) = 3.
