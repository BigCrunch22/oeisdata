%N A243884 Type of walk that occurs when walking along a ray emanating from the center of a rotationally symmetric Penrose rhomb tiling with a "Sun" patch at the center (see comments for details).
%C A243884 The ray starts at the center of the tiling and goes through the center of one of the thick rhombs of the central "Sun" patch. The walk types that can occur are encoded as follows:
%C A243884 Walk type                     | Number
%C A243884 ---------------------------------------
%C A243884 along diagonal of thick rhomb | 1
%C A243884 along edge of thick rhomb     | 2
%C A243884 along diagonal of thin rhomb  | 3
%C A243884 along edge of thin rhomb      | 4
