%N A243407 Decimal expansion of Pálfy's constant c_3 = 5/3 + log_9(32).
%C A243407 Pálfy proved there are no primitive solvable permutation groups T with order greater than n^c_3 / 24^(1/3) but infinitely many for which equality is attained, where n is the degree of the group. Such groups necessarily have degree which is a power of 3, hence the subscript. He also gave tighter bounds for other prime powers.
