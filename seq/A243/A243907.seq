%N A243907 Numbers that can be expressed as n*m + (n-1)*(m-1), n = 2, 3, ... , m = n, n+1, n+2, ... in at least two different ways. Ordered increasingly.
%C A243907 This sequence was inspired by the flag of the United States. The 50 stars are placed in a rectangular grid with outside dimensions six stars wide by five stars high, but they could also be placed in a grid 17 stars wide by two stars high. This sequence lists, up to 200 stars, all numbers of stars that could be placed in a rectangular field in more than one arrangement.
%C A243907 This is the ordered list of integers that appear several times in A144650.
%C A243907 R(n,m) = n*m + (n-1)*(m-1) = (m-1)*(2*n-1) + n == n (mod (2*n-1)), and also with n interchanged with m. See A244418 for the table a(n,m) = R(n,m) for n >= m >= 1. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jul 10 2014

%Y A243907 The sequence A186041 lists all possible solutions, including single ones, and has four additional terms at the start. The sequence A140646 also refers to the Stars-and-Stripes, but gives the history, not the geometry of the current arrangement.
%Y A243907 Cf. also A144650, with all values organized by rows (but with different offset).
