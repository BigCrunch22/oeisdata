%N A243021 Numbers n such that n appears in the sequence beginning with the digit-sum of n and extended by adding successive digit-sums.
%C A243021 Numbers n>9 with following property: form a sequence b(i) whose initial term is digit-sum(n). Later terms are given by the rule that b(i) = b(i-1) + digit-sum(b(i-1)) and n itself appears in the sequence.
%F A243021 b(i) = b(i-1) + digit-sum(b(i-1))
%e A243021 When n = 0..9, the sequence immediately produces n. The sequence for 12 is seeded with digital-sum(12) = 3, 3 + 3 = 6, 6 + 6 = 12. 15 yields 6, 6 + 6 = 12, 12 + 3 = 15. 18 yields 9, 9 + 9 = 18. 21 yields 3, 3 + 3 = 6, 6 + 6 = 12, 12 + 3 = 15, 15 + 6 = 21.
