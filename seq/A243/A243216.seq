%N A243216 Sum of integer partitions of n, with each partition being read as a decimal number.
%C A243216 Parts greater than 9 are treated according to their decimal digits.  For example, the four partitions of 12 with parts greater than 9 are: {12}, {11, 1}, {10, 2}, and {10, 1, 1}.  Read as decimal numbers, they become 12, 111, 102, and 1011.
%e A243216 The integer partitions of 5 are: {5}, {4, 1}, {3, 2}, {3, 1, 1}, {2, 2, 1}, {2, 1, 1, 1}, and {1, 1, 1, 1, 1}.  Read as decimal numbers, they are 5, 41, 32, 311, 221, 2111, and 11111, the total of which is 13832, so a(5) = 13832.
