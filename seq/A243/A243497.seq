%N A243497 A243496 sorted into ascending order, with duplicates removed.
%C A243497 Matula-codes for trees which are almost "uniform", but which allow cases like 169, 841, 1009, 1681, 1849, ... where there is a special relation between prime index and the exponent. (Cf. the comments at A243496).
%C A243497 Differs from A214577 for the first time at n=31, where A214577(31)=227, while here we have 169 at that position, because it corresponds exactly to that "dual" case mentioned in A057546, in excess to those mentioned in A003238. Note that 169 = 13*13 = p_{2*3}^2.
%C A243497 a(0) = 1 stands for the empty tree.
%Y A243497 Cf. A214577 (a subsequence), A209638, A243494.
