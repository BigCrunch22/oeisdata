%N A243370 Decimal expansion of the number A = 1.8252076... which generates the densest possibly infinite sequence of primes a(n) = floor[A^(C^n)] for A < 2. That prime sequence is A243358.
%C A243370 It is very likely, but not yet proved, that the sequence of primes A243358 is actually infinite. But it's clear that if such an infinite sequence exists, then its density parameter C should be larger than C_0 = 1.2209864... (see A117739).

%F A243370 A = 84^(1/C_0^10), where C_0 (mentioned above) is given in A117739.
