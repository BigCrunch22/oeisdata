%N A243992 The sequence can be seen as a succession of digit-chunks ending in "1". The digit-size of each chunk is given by the sequence itself. No term is repeated. This is the lexically first sequence with the property.
%C A243992 All integers appear in the sequence, except the ones that have two or more consecutive 1's (like 11,110,111,112,113,...).
%e A243992 If we put a vertical stroke right after each "1", the sequence becomes:
%e A243992 1|2,1|0,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,21|20,1|2,22,1|3,23,31|24,25,41|26,27,28,1|4,29,30,32,1|5... Now count the digits between two strokes: you'll get 1,2,10,3,4,5,6,7,8,... which is the sequence itself.
