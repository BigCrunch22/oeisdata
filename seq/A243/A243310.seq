%N A243310 Smallest k such that both prime(k)*prime(k+1) +/- 2^n are prime, or 0 if no such k exists.
%C A243310 a(n) = 0 for n > 5?
%C A243310 a(n) = 0 for 5 < n <= 10000. Heuristics suggest that there are no other nonzero terms. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jun 04 2014
%e A243310 a(0) = 1 because prime(1)*prime(1+1)-2^0 = 5 and prime(1)*prime(1+1) + 2^0 = 7 are prime,
