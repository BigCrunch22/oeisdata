%N A358338 a(n) = abs(a(n-1) - count(a(n-1))) where count(a(n-1)) is the number of times a(n-1) has appeared so far in the sequence, a(1)=0.
%C A358338 This sequence is related to the inventory sequence (A342585) as it uses the number of times a number has occurred so far in the sequence.
%C A358338 The following comments are only empirical observations:
%C A358338 ceiling(sqrt(2n)) is an excellent envelope of a(n) with no exceptions found in the first 50000 terms.
%C A358338 When x > 3 appears for the first time, it seems to always be preceded by a 1 and followed by x-1. Also, x-1 will already have occurred earlier in the sequence (new highest terms grow by 1).
%C A358338 The number of times x > 0 appears in the first k terms seems to approximately equal sqrt(2k)-x-1. Therefore, 1 appears approximately sqrt(2k) times. The highest term that has appeared in k terms is then approximately sqrt(2k), which also makes sense considering the number of times 1 appears and the fact that a new number is preceded by 1. The only exception is 0, which appears approximately sqrt(2k)/2 times.

%e A358338 For n=2, a(2-1)=0 and 0 has occurred 1 time so far so a(2)=abs(0-1)=1.
%e A358338 For n=12, a(12-1)=1 and 1 has occurred 4 times so far so a(12)=abs(1-4)=3.
