%N A358129 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct nonnegative integers on a square spiral such that no number shares a digit with any of its four orthogonally adjacent neighbors.
%C A358129 This sequence is similar to A358021 except here only the four orthogonally adjacent neighbors are considered. It is unknown if the sequence eventually terminates; if it does, it does so after more than 1.5 million terms. In that range on numerous occasions the only available number is one containing only the digit 7. For example a(862833) = 7...7, where there are forty-nine 7's.

%e A358129 a(10) = 20 as when the tenth cell is filled its two orthogonal neighbors use the digits 1 and 9, and 20 is the smallest unused number that does not contain either of those digits.
