%N A358434 Number of odd middle divisors of n, where "middle divisor" means a divisor in the half-open interval [sqrt(n/2), sqrt(n*2)).
%C A358434 Number of odd divisors of n in the half-open interval [sqrt(n/2), sqrt(n*2)).
%C A358434 Also number of odd numbers in the n-th row of A299761.
%F A358434 a(n) = A067742(n) - A361561(n). - _Omar E. Pol_, Mar 31 2023
%e A358434 For n = 8 the middle divisor of 8 is [2]. There are no odd middle divisors of 8 so a(8) = 0.
%e A358434 For n = 12 the middle divisors of 12 are [3, 4]. There is only one odd middle divisor of 12 so a(12) = 1.
%e A358434 For n = 15 the middle divisors of 15 are [3, 5]. There are two odd middle divisors of 15 so a(15) = 2.
