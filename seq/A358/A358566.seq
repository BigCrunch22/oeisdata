%N A358566 Number of distinct spans of length n with no 3-term arithmetic progression, containing zero, and with maximum element smallest possible.
%C A358566 Offset by 1 from the same function in the referenced paper, which does not include zero in their count of how long spans are for the "well-spaced rows".
%H A358566 Noam Benson-Tilsen, Samuel Brock, Brandon Faunce, Monish Kumar, Noah Dokko Stein, and Joshua Zelinsky, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11706">Total Difference Labeling of Regular Infinite Graphs</a>, arXiv:2107.11706 [math.CO], 2021-2022.
%e A358566 a(5)=4 since we have as possible spans 0,1,3,7,8; 0,1,5,6,8; 0,1,5,7,8; 0,2,3,7,8. (It is easy to check that if the maximum term is 7 or lower then there must be fewer than 5 elements in the sequence.)
