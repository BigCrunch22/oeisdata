%N A358312 Consider the graph of symmetric primes where p and q are connected if |p-q| = gcd(p-1,q-1). This sequence is an irregular table where the n-th row lists the first symmetric prime in a connected component with n vertices, with one representative for each nonisomorphic graph. Within a row, graphs are ordered by increasing size of its initial prime.
%C A358312 Row lengths are A001349(n); if the sequence is finite the last row may be shorter.
%C A358312 Kalmynin gives T(2, 1) = 3343 and proves that, under a conjecture which is intermediate between Dickson's conjecture and the Bateman-Horn-Stemmler conjecture, that this sequence is infinite.
