%N A358089 First differences of A126706.
%C A358089 A356322 relates to the first instances of exactly k consecutive 1's in this sequence.
%C A358089 a(n) - 1 = number of 0's between 1's in A355447.
%C A358089 For prime p, m such that m mod p^2, unless m = p^e, e > 1, is in A126706, as a consequence of definition of A126706. Therefore m <= 4 is common, m <= 9 much less so. Consequently, the arrangement of A126706 mod M for M in A061742 presents a quasi-modular pattern as seen in the example and raster link at A355447.
%C A358089 a(51265) = 7; m = 9 is not observed in the first 6577230 terms of the sequence, a dataset corresponding to terms k <= 2^24 in A126706.
