%N A358553 Number of internal (non-leaf) nodes in the n-th standard ordered rooted tree.
%C A358553 We define the n-th standard ordered rooted tree to be obtained by taking the (n-1)-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) as root and replacing each part with its own standard ordered rooted tree. This ranking is an ordered variation of Matula-Goebel numbers, giving a bijective correspondence between positive integers and unlabeled ordered rooted trees.
%e A358553 The 89-th standard rooted tree is ((o)o(oo)), and it has 3 internal nodes, so a(89) = 3.
