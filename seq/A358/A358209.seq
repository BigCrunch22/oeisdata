%N A358209 a(1) = 1; a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number not occurring earlier that shares a factor with A024916(n-1) = Sum_{k=1..n-1} sigma(k).
%C A358209 The majority of terms are concentrated just below the line a(n) = n. However, some terms are much larger because the sum of the divisors of all previous terms is a prime number. In the first 5000 terms there are thirteen fixed points: 32, 52, 54, ..., 1331, 2082, 2097.
%C A358209 Conjecture: the sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.
%H A358209 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A358209/a358209.png">Image of the first 5000 terms where a(n) is less than 110% of n</a>. The green line is a(n) = n.
%e A358209 a(5) = 3 as sigma(1) + sigma(2) + sigma(3) + sigma(4) = A024916(4) = 15, and 3 is the smallest unused number that shares a factor with 15.
