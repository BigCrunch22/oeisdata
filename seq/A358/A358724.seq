%N A358724 Difference between the number of internal (non-leaf) nodes and the edge-height of the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number n.
%C A358724 Edge-height (A109082) is the number of edges in the longest path from root to leaf.
%C A358724 The Matula-Goebel number of a rooted tree is the product of primes indexed by the Matula-Goebel numbers of the branches of its root, which gives a bijective correspondence between positive integers and unlabeled rooted trees.
%F A358724 a(n) = A342507(n) - A109082(n).
%e A358724 The tree (o(o)((o))(oo)) with Matula-Goebel number 210 has edge-height 3 and 5 internal nodes, so a(210) = 2.
