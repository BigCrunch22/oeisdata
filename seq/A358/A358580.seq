%N A358580 Difference between the number of leaves and the number of internal (non-leaf) nodes in the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number n.
%C A358580 The Matula-Goebel number of a rooted tree is the product of primes indexed by the Matula-Goebel numbers of the branches of its root, which gives a bijective correspondence between positive integers and unlabeled rooted trees.
%F A358580 a(n) = A109129(n) - A342507(n).
%e A358580 The Matula-Goebel number of ((ooo(o))) is 89, and it has 4 leaves and 3 internal nodes, so a(89) = 1.
