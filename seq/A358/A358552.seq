%N A358552 Node-height of the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number n. Number of nodes in the longest path from root to leaf.
%C A358552 Edge-height is given by A109082 (see formula).
%C A358552 The Matula-Goebel number of a rooted tree is the product of primes indexed by the Matula-Goebel numbers of the branches of its root, which gives a bijective correspondence between positive integers and unlabeled rooted trees.
%F A358552 a(n) = A109082(n) + 1.
%e A358552 The Matula-Goebel number of ((ooo(o))) is 89, and it has node-height 4, so a(89) = 4.
