%N A358082 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number not occurring earlier that shares a factor with Sum_{k=1..n-1} sigma(a(k)).
%C A358082 The sequence shows large jumps in value due to the sum occasionally forming a large prime, e.g., a(279) = 2650277753. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
%e A358082 a(7) = 5 as Sum_{k=1..6} sigma(a(k)) = Sum_{k=1..6} A000203(a(k)) = 1 + 3 + 7 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 95, and 5 is the smallest unused number that shares a factor with 95.
