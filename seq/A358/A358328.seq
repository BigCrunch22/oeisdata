%N A358328 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of polygons with 2*n sides, of which k run through the center of a circle, on the circumference of which the 2*n vertices of the polygon are arranged at equal spacing, up to rotation.
%C A358328 By "2*n-sided polygons" we mean the polygons that can be drawn by connecting 2*n equally spaced points on a circle.
%C A358328 T(0,0)=0 and T(0,1)=1 by convention.
%C A358328 The sequence is limited to even-sided polygons, since all odd-sided polygons have no side passing through the center.
