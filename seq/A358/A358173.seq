%N A358173 First differences of A286708.
%C A358173 Consider the sequence of powerful numbers A001694, superset of A246547, the sequence of composite prime powers. Let s = A001694(k) such that omega(s) > 1 be followed by t = A001694(k+1) such that omega(t) = 1.
%C A358173 Since A286708 = A001694 \ A246547, prime powers t are missing in A286708. We consider s = A286708(j) and note that the difference A286708(j+1) - A286708(j) > A001694(k+1) - A001694(k).
%C A358173 Therefore we see a subset S containing s in A286708 that plots "out of place" with respect to the complementary subset R = A286708 \ S; some of this subset S exceeds the maxima of R in the scatterplot of this sequence. The plot of the R resembles the scatterplot of A001694.

%e A358173 The number 36 is the smallest powerful number that is not a prime power; the next powerful number that is not a prime power is 72, and their difference is 36, hence a(1) = 36.
