%N A358784 Size of largest semigroup generated by three n X n boolean matrices.
%C A358784 Here the semigroup is under boolean matrix multiplication (not the same as GF(2) matrix multiplication).  It is known that a(4) >= 24846, generated by the three matrices [[0,0,0,1],[1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0]] and [[0,0,0,1],[0,0,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,0,0,1]] and [[0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1],[0,0,1,0],[0,1,0,0]].
%e A358784 For n = 1 the maximum size is 2, generated by the three matrices [0] and [1] and [1].
%e A358784 For n = 2 the maximum size is 16, generated by the three matrices [[0,1],[1,1]] and [[0,1],[1,0]] and [[0,0],[0,1]].
%e A358784 For n = 3 the maximum size is 440, generated by the three matrices [[0,0,1],[1,0,0],[0,1,0]] and [[0,0,1],[0,1,0],[1,0,1]] and [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,1,0]].
%Y A358784 Cf. A217990 (for one matrix); A202140 (for two matrices).
