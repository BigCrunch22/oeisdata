%N A358671 Numbers k such that for all factorizations of k as x*y, the sum x+y is carryfree when the addition is done in the primorial base, A049345.
%C A358671 Numbers k such that there are no factorization of k into such a pair of natural numbers x and y that would generate any carries when added together in the primorial base.

%F A358671 {k | A358233(k) = A038548(k)}.
%e A358671 8 is not included, because while factorization 1*8 would yield a carry-free sum ("1" and "110" added together gives "111" = 9 in primorial base, A049345), factorization 2*4 would not, as 2+4 (= "10" + "20") and 2 is the max. allowed digit in the second rightmost place.
