%N A358755 a(n) = 1 if A053669(n) [the smallest prime not dividing n] is of the form 6m-1, otherwise a(n) = 0.
%C A358755 The XOR-formula involving A358842 corresponds to the XOR-formula given for A353529, which is based on the lemma given in A353516. A similar lemma exists for mod 6 case.

%e A358755 For n = 6 = 2*3, the smallest prime that does not divide it is 5, which is of the form 6m-1, therefore a(6) = 1.
%e A358755 For n = 30 = 2*3*5, the smallest prime that does not divide it is 7, which is of the form 6m+1, therefore a(30) = 0.

%e A358755 For n = 30030 = 2*3*5*7*11*13, the smallest prime that does not divide it is 17, which is of the form 6m-1, therefore a(30030) = 1.
%e A358755 For n = 223092870 = 2*3*5*7*11*13*17*19*23, the smallest nondividing prime is 29, which is of the form 6m-1, therefore a(223092870) = 1. This is also the least n where this sequence differs from the characteristic function of the even terms of A342051, (numbers k such that k is even and A276084(k) is also even).
