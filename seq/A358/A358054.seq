%N A358054 Starting with 0, smallest integer not yet in the sequence such that no two neighboring digits differ by 1.
%C A358054 Integers such as 10, 12, 21, 76, 6792, and 10744 (see A082927) will not appear in the sequence as they contain adjacent digits that differ by 1. Some integers may be disallowed only temporarily; for example, if a(n) = 79, and all nonnegative integers < 79 are already in the sequence, then a(n+1) = 90, because a(n+1) must not start with an 8, as it would differ by 1 from the digit "9" in 79. Now, a(n+2) can equal 80.
