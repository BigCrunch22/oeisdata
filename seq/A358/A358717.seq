%N A358717 A sequence of sorted primes 2 = p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_m such that (p_i + 1)/2 divides the product p_1*p_2*...*p_(i-1) of the earlier primes and each prime factor of (p_i-1)/2 is a prime factor of the product.
%C A358717 The sequence was used, together with A358718 and A358719, by Ferrari and Sillari (Preprint-2022) to prove that there are at least three solutions n to phi(n+k) = 2* phi(n) for all even k <= 4*10^58.
%C A358717 I have checked up to 10^8 and found no more terms.
%C A358717 Prime a(14) does not exist, which can be established by going over the divisors d of the product a(1)*...*a(13) and testing 2*d-1 as a candidate for a(14). - _Max Alekseyev_, Feb 19 2024
