%N A358629 a(n) is the number of signed permutations W of V = (1, 2, ..., n) such that the dot product V*W = 0.
%C A358629 Let V be an n-vector of the numbers 1 to n in sequence and let W be an n-vector of a signed permutation of these numbers. Numbers in W may be either positive or negative. a(n) is the number of vectors W which allow the scalar product V*W = 0. We include identity as a permutation. We allow all combinations of positive and negative signs in W; this means 2^n combinations of signs.
%C A358629 Another interpretation of this sequence: A signed permutohedron is also called the Coxeter permutohedron of the family C_n and has A000165(n) vertices. If we choose one vertex of such a permutohedron and define a hyperplane through the origin by the normal vector pointing from this vertex to the origin, then a(n) is the number of vertices which lie on this hyperplane.
%C A358629 The group G(r, n) is the group of n X n matrices such that there is exactly one nonzero entry in each row and column, and this entry is an r-th root of unity. Let the matrix M be a member of G(2, n) (hyperoctahedral group), then a(n) is the number of M where V'*(M*V) = 0 holds. Each vertex of our Coxeter permutohedron C_n corresponds to one such M acting as M*V. V is here an n-vector [1, 2, ..., n]. V' means the transpose of V.
