%N A358532 a(n) is the row position of the next open point in the structure generated by adding the largest diamond possible at the next open point on a triangular grid of side n. See Comments and Example sections for more details.
%C A358532 A structure of diamonds is built up successively by adding the largest possible diamond to the next open point within a triangular grid of side n. Each new diamond is added to the preceding structure of diamonds. At each step n, a new row of n open points is first added, extending the triangular grid.
%C A358532 Then the next open point is defined as the first open point encountered when the triangle is read by rows starting from the top row. a(n) is then the row position of the next open point.
%C A358532 Finally, starting at this open point the largest diamond that does not overlap any previous diamonds and fits within the triangular grid is added. Each diamond of side length k must cover exactly k^2 points, with the top corner on an open point. The points covered by the added diamond are then considered closed.
%C A358532 Is there a pattern for the values of n where a(n) = 1?
