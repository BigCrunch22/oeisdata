%N A358734 Number of down-steps (1,-1) among all n-length nondecreasing Dyck paths with air pockets.
%C A358734 A Dyck path with air pockets is a nonempty lattice path in the first quadrant of Z^2 starting at the origin, ending on the x-axis, and consisting of up-steps (1,1) and down-steps (1,-k), k > 0, where two down-steps cannot be consecutive. It is then nondecreasing if the sequence of heights of its valleys is nondecreasing, i.e., the sequence of the minimal ordinates of the occurrences (1,-k)--(1,1), k>0, is nondecreasing from left to the right.
%C A358734 For all k>0, a(n-k) is the number of k-pyramids (i.e., k consecutive up-steps (1,1), then a down-step (1,-k)) among all (n-1)-length nondecreasing Dyck paths with air pockets.
