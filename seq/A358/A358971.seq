%N A358971 a(1) = 1. Thereafter a(n) is least novel k != n such that rad(k) = rad(n), where rad is A007947.
%C A358971 In other words, for n > 1, a(n) is the least novel k other than n which has not occurred earlier whose squarefree kernel is equal to the squarefree kernel of n.
%C A358971 Conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers with primes appearing in natural order. Primes are minima, 1 and primes squared are records.
%C A358971 From _Michael De Vlieger_, Dec 07 2022: (Start)
%C A358971 Some consequences of definition:
%C A358971 There are no fixed points outside of a(1) = 1.
%C A358971 Prime power p^e implies a(p^e) = p^(e+1) for odd e, else p^(e-1). Hence a(p) = p^2 comprise maxima, while a(p^2) = p comprise minima.
%C A358971 Let lpf(m) = least prime factor of m. Squarefree m implies a(m) = lpf(m)*m and a(lpf(m)*m) = m, as seen in scatterplot in rays with slope p and 1/p, respectively. Therefore squarefree numbers are sequestered along or below a(n/2) = n/2.
%C A358971 Let K = rad(n); a(n) and n (such that a(n) != n) belong to the same sequence K*R_K, where R_K is the list of K-regular numbers, 1 and those whose prime divisors are restricted to p | K. For example, if K = 6, then a(n) and n belong to 6*A003586, and if K = 10, then a(n) and n belong to 10*A003592.
%C A358971 Observation: For m in A286708, abs(a(m) - m) is relatively small. (End)
%C A358971 This sequence is a self-inverse permutation of the positive integers: for any squarefree number s > 1, let v_s be the list of numbers with radical s, then for any k > 0, a(v_s(2*k)) = v_s(2*k-1) and a(v_s(2*k-1)) = v_s(2*k). - _RÃ©my Sigrist_, Dec 08 2022
