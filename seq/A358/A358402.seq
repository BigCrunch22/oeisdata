%N A358402 a(1) = 0; for n > 1, let a(n-1) = m; if a(n-1) is the first occurrence of m then a(n) = 0, but if there is a k < n-1 with a(k) = m, a(n) is the minimum of n-1-k and j, where a(j) is the first occurrence of m in the sequence.
%C A358402 This sequence can be considered a variation of Van Eck's sequence, see A181391, but where the sequence forms a loop of numbers, joined at its first and last term before each a(n) is calculated. When a previously unseen number first appears the following term is 0, and as 0 appears as the first term of the sequence, the next term after these 0's will always be 1.
%C A358402 See A358403 for the index where each number first appears.

%e A358402 a(5) = 1 as a(4) = 0 and 0 appears as the first term of the sequence.
%e A358402 a(6) = 2 as a(5) = 1 and a(3) = 1, these being separated by two terms.
%e A358402 a(17) = 6 as a(16) = 2 and 2 appears as the sixth term of the sequence. Note that the number of terms between the two previous occurrences of 2 is 16 - 6 = 10 which is larger than 6, so 6 is chosen.
