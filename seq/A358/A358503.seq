%N A358503 Positions inventory sequence: for stage k >= 2 we record where all the numbers from the two previous stages have appeared, starting with a(0) = 0, a(1) = 0.
%C A358503 When the sequence is displayed as a triangle, the row corresponding to stage k >= 2 is a permutation of the numbers from Fibonacci(k) - 1 to Fibonacci(k+2) - 2.
%e A358503 As an irregular triangle, the sequence begins:
%e A358503   0;
%e A358503   0;
%e A358503   0,  1;
%e A358503   1,  2,  3;
%e A358503   2,  3,  4,  5,  6;
%e A358503   4,  5,  7,  6,  8,  9, 10, 11;
%e A358503   7,  8,  9, 12, 10, 13, 11, 15, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19;
%e A358503   ...
%e A358503 At stage 5 we look at two previous stages 3 and 4 and see the
%e A358503 positions of 1's: 4;
%e A358503 positions of 2's: 5, 7;
%e A358503 positions of 3's: 6, 8;
%e A358503 positions of 4's: 9;
%e A358503 positions of 5's: 10;
%e A358503 positions of 6's: 11;
%e A358503 thus stage 5 is 4, 5, 7, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11.
