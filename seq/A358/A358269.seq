%N A358269 a(n) is the position m of the last prime term in the sequence {b(m)} defined by b(1) = n, if b(m) is prime then b(m+1) = b(m) - m, else b(m+1) = b(m) + m.
%C A358269 A sequence {b(m)} is guaranteed to have no more primes when the m-th term "k" with value "s" is the sum of at least 3 consecutive positive integers where the sum is "s" and the last consecutive positive integer in the sum is k-1. Any number which is the sum of at least three consecutive positive integers is guaranteed to be composite. By the definition of the sequence, the next term k + 1 = s + k, and this term will be the sum of at least three consecutive positive integers with the last consecutive positive integer being k. This guarantees that this term is also guaranteed to be composite, and by induction, all future terms in {b(m)} will be composite.
%C A358269 In a sequence {b(m)}, if the m-th term k with value s satisfies c = (sqrt(-8*s + 4*k^2 - 4*k + 1) + 1)/2 for a positive integer c with s being nonprime and k > 3 then the value of all terms >= k will be composite.
%C A358269 It is unknown whether all initial conditions "n" guarantee a final prime. All terms up to n = 1000 have a final prime.
%C A358269 Treat negative numbers in the sequence {b(m)} as nonprime. The only n whose {b(m)} contain negative terms b(m) are 1, 3, 6, and 7.

%e A358269 For n = 9: b(1) = 9. Nonprime, b(2) = 9 + 1 = 10. Nonprime, b(3) = 10 + 2 = 12. Nonprime, b(4) = 12 + 3 = 15. Nonprime, b(5) = 15 + 4 = 19. Prime, b(6) = 19 - 5 = 14. Note 14 = 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 and is nonprime, so b(7) = 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 and nonprime. All b(m) after this will be nonprime by the same pattern, thus the final prime for b(1) = 9 occurs at b(5), and a(9) = 5.
