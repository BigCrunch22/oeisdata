%N A358783 The number of edges formed when every pair of n points, placed at the vertices of a regular n-gon, are connected by a circle and where the points lie at the ends of the circle's diameter.
%C A358783 Conjecture: for odd values of n all vertices are simple, other than those defining the diameters of the circles. No formula for n, or only the odd values of n, is currently known.
%C A358783 See A358746 and A358782 for images of the circles.
%C A358783 The author thanks Zach Shannon some of whose code was used in the generation of this sequence.
%C A358783 If n is odd, the circle containing the initial n points is not part of the graph (compare A370976-A370979). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 25 2024
%F A358783 a(n) = A358746(n) + A358782(n) - 1 by Euler's formula.
