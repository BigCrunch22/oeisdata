%N A358627 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of edges formed when n points are placed along each edge of a square that divide the edges into n+1 equal parts and a line is continuously drawn from the current point to that k points, 2 <= k <= 2*n, counterclockwise around the square until the starting point is again reached.
%C A358627 See A358556 for further details and images of the squares.
%H A358627 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A358627/a358627.txt">Table for n=1..50</a>.
%F A358627 T(n,k) = A358574(n,k) + A358556(n,k) - 1 by Euler's formula.
%F A358627 T(n,2*n) = 4*(n + 1) + 1. The line cuts the square into two parts so one additional edge is created.
%F A358627 T(n,k) = 4*(n + 2) where n >= 2, k <= n, and k|(4*n). Four lines cut across the square's corners so four additional edges are created.
