%N A358175 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; a(3) = 3; for n > 3, a(n) is the smallest positive number not occurring earlier that shares a factor with Sum_{k=1..n-1} A001065(a(k)), where A001065(m) is the sum of the proper divisors of m.
%C A358175 The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers. In the first 10000 terms, other than the first three terms, there are thirty-five fixed points, the last being 2051. It is plausible no more exist although this is unknown.
%e A358175 a(9) = 10 as Sum_{k=1..8} A001065(a(k)) = 0 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 6 + 7 + 1 = 20, and 10 is the smallest unused number that shares a factor with 20.
