%N A358071 Numbers k that can be written as the sum of a perfect square and a factorial in at least 2 distinct ways.
%C A358071 This does not count x^2 and (-x)^2 as distinct, nor does it count 0! and 1! as distinct.
%C A358071 For any two factorials a > b, where a-b = m*n where m > n and (m and n are both even or m and n are both odd), (((m-n)/2)^2 + a) will appear in this sequence.
