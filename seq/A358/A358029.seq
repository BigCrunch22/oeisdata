%N A358029 Decimal expansion of the ratio between step sizes of the diatonic and chromatic semitones produced by a circle of 12 perfect fifths in Pythagorean tuning.
%C A358029 Pythagorean tuning is a form of tuning produced by repeated stacking of the perfect fifth, which has the frequency ratio of 3:2. A circle of 12 perfect fifths is approximately equal to the tuning system predominantly in use in the world today. If the perfect fifth is stacked 12 times and the resulting sequence is octave-reduced, then this divides the octave into 5 chromatic semitones which are equal to 2187/2048 (A229948), and 7 diatonic semitones which are equal to 256/243 (A229943). Diatonic semitones are those which are derived from a circle of 7 perfect fifths, the diatonic scale, and 5 chromatic semitones are a byproduct of an addition of 5 more perfect fifths, that is, another rotation, to the scale.
