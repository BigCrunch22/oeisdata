%N A358719 A sequence of primes starting with p_1 = 2, p_2 = 3, p_3 = 5, p_4 = 11, p_5 = 13, p_6 = 23, such that, for i >= 7, (p_i + 1)/2 divides the product p_1*p_2*...*p_(i-1) of the earlier primes and each prime factor of (p_i-1)/2 is a prime factor of the product p_1*p_2*...*p_(i-1).
%C A358719 The sequence was used, together with A358717 and A358718, by Ferrari and Sillari (Preprint-2022) to prove that there are at least three solutions n to phi(n+k) = 2*phi(n) for all even k <= 4*10^58.
%C A358719 Prime a(28) does not exist, which can be established by going over the divisors d of the product a(1)*...*a(27) and testing 2*d-1 as a candidate for a(28). - _Max Alekseyev_, Feb 19 2024
