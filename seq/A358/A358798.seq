%N A358798 a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest prime that can be appended to the sequence so that the smallest even number >= 4 that cannot be generated as the sum of two (not necessarily distinct) terms from {a(1), ..., a(n-1)} can be generated from {a(1), ..., a(n)}.
%C A358798 Related to the Goldbach conjecture. Proving that this sequence is non-terminating would prove the Goldbach conjecture.

%e A358798 For n=5, the sequence a(1..4) is 2, 3, 5, 7. The even numbers 4..14 are sums of two terms and 16 is the smallest even number not a sum. The smallest prime allowing 16 to be made is 11, by 5 + 11 = 16. Thus, a(5) = 11.
%e A358798 For n=106, the smallest even number that is not the sum of two terms a(1..105) is 1082. The smallest prime allowing 1082 to be made is 541, by 541 + 541 = 1082. Thus, a(106) = 541.
