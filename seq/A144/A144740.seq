%N A144740 Partial totient function phi(c, n) for c = 2: number of semiprimes less than and coprime to n.
%C A144740 phi(c, n) = 0 iff n is in A048597.
%H A144740 Reikku Kulon, <a href="/A144740/b144740.txt">Table of n, phi(2, n) for n = 1..10000</a>
%e A144740 phi(2, 7) = 2: the two semiprimes less than 7 are 4 and 6.
%e A144740 phi(2, 15) = 2: there are five semiprimes less than 15 (4, 6, 9, 10, 14), but only 4 and 14 are relatively prime to 15.
%Y A144740 Cf. A048597.
%Y A144740 Cf. A036997 (phi(n) - max(phi(c, n)) over all nonnegative integers c).
