%N A144553 Number of chiral pairs of polyominoes with n cells that have precisely the symmetry group of order 4 generated by 90-degree rotations.
%C A144553 The values for n>28 were produced by a set of programs, the most difficult of which is attached. There is no guarantee that the values are correct, although presumably Shirakawa has calculated them through a(45). The attached program can be altered to count only achiral polyominoes, and those results match those of A142886, which uses a very different method. The difficulties lie in determining each inner loop (A324408 and A324409) and in determining connections within the inner loop (bad_connection subroutine). The last bug I found in the program affected only polyominoes with 72 or more cells. - _Robert A. Russell_, May 23 2020
%C A144553 These are polyominoes of the regular tiling with Schläfli symbol {4,4}. In late August, 2021, _John Mason_ informed me that there were errors for a(44) and higher. My error in a(44) was a copying error, but later entries were wrong because of my programming errors. After making corrections (see attached C++ program), our values now match. John uses a unique calculation of his own devising. Since it is quite different from Redelmeier's inner rings, the match gives us some confidence in the current values. - _Robert A. Russell_, Nov 01 2021
%C A144553 Polyominoes with precisely 90-degree symmetry centered about square centers and vertices are enumerated by A351142 and A234007 respectively. - _John Mason_, Feb 17 2022
