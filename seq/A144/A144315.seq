%N A144315 Prime numbers p such that p - 1 is the fourth a-figurate number, eighth b-figurate number and possibly sixteenth c-figurate number for some a, b and c and not a d-figurate number for any nontrivial d.
%C A144315 The 37th Mersenne prime exponent (Mpe, A000043) 3021377 is a member: 3021376 is the fourth 503564-figurate number, the eighth 107908-figurate number and the sixteenth 25180-figurate number and is not a k-figurate number for any other k except 3021376 (trivially). The 44th Mersenne prime exponent 32582657 is not a member of this sequence; however, it is a (4, 8, 16, 64) k-figurate number.
%C A144315 It is conjectured:
%C A144315 - that this sequence is infinite;
%C A144315 - that there is a unique set {4, 8, 16, 64, ...} (A074700?) giving the possible orders in k-figurate numbers for the set S of all Mpe for which Mpe - 1 is a (4, 8) k-figurate number;
%C A144315 - that the ratio of Mpe in this sequence to those not approaches a nonzero value;
%C A144315 - that a characteristic function f(n) exists which equals 1 iff n is in S.
