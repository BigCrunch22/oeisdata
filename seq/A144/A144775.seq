%N A144775 Define f(n) = 2 * rad(n) if four divides n and rad(n) otherwise: then a(n) = 0 for composite n where f(n) is not less than n and otherwise equals the number of positive integers k less than n for which f(k) < f(n).
%C A144775 This sequence obtains a new maximum a(n) = n - 1 for prime n.
%C A144775 a(n) = 0 often, but not always, when n - 1 and n + 1 are twin primes.
%e A144775 f(8) = 2 * rad(8) = 4. f(k) < 4 for 1, 2 and 3 (f(k) = k for 0 < k < 8); a(8) = 3.
