%C A144831 Suggested by Conjecture 60 in Carlos Rivera's The Prime Puzzles & Problems Connection.
%C A144831 Legendre's conjecture that there is always a prime between n^2 and (n+1)^2 is equivalent to a(n) >= 0 for all n. As the conjecture is still opened, it is not proved that a(n) is nonn, although the keyword is automatically added. - _Jean-Christophe Hervé_, Oct 26 2013

%F A144831 Calculate n^2 and (n+1)^2, e.g. 4 - 9. Find the next prime following n^2 and subtract from (n+1)^2. Next prime is 5 so 9-5=4, the distance from next prime to (n+1)^2.
%F A144831 a(n) = (n+1)^2 - A007491(n).
%e A144831 a(2)=4 because n=2, 2^2=4 and (2+1)^2=9. The gap in which primes are to be found is 4 - 9. Next prime=5 and 9-5=4. For a(3)=5, 3^2=9 and (3+1)^2=16. Next prime=11 and 16-11=5.
