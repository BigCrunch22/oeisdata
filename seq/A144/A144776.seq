%N A144776 Define f(n) = 1 if n is prime, 2 * rad(n) if four divides n and rad(n) otherwise: then a(n) = 0 for composite n where f(n) is not less than n and otherwise equals the number of positive integers k less than n for which f(k) < f(n).
%C A144776 For the given terms, nearly all n for which a(n) obtains a new maximum are multiples of eight. Only 18, 36 and 45 are not.
