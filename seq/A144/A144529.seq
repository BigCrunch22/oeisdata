%N A144529 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = number of edges in graph whose vertices are forests with n unlabeled nodes and degree <= k and in which two vertices are joined by an edge if the forests differ (up to isomorphism) by exactly one edge.
%C A144529 The number of nodes in this graph is given by A144215.
