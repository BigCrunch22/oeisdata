%N A144926 Number of n X n (-1,1)-circulant matrices with determinant 0.
%C A144926 The sequence comes from a problem suggested by Fred Lunnon on the math-fun mailing list on Sep 24 2008. a(n) is also the number of polynomials of degree at most n-1 with all coefficients equal to 1 or -1 which are not invertible modulo x^n - 1. I have a proof that a(n) = 2 if n is an odd prime. - _W. Edwin Clark_
%C A144926 _Max Alekseyev_'s proof that a(2*p) = 2*binomial(2*p,p) if p is an odd prime:
%C A144926 First notice that A144926(2p) equals the number of such (1,-1)-polynomials f(x) of degree 2p-1 that are divisible by at least one of the cyclotomic polynomials of orders 1, 2, p, or 2p (that are divisors of 2p). These cyclotomic polynomials are: c(1,x) = x - 1, c(2,x) = x + 1, c(p,x) = x^(p-1) + x^(p-2) + ... + x + 1, and c(2p,x) = x^(p-1) - x^(p-2) + ... - x + 1.
%C A144926 Our goal is to prove that (i) f(x) may be divisible only by (x-1) or (x+1) but not both; (ii) if c(p,x) divides f(x) then so does either (x-1) or (x+1) ; (iii) if c(2p,x) divides f(x) then so does either (x-1) or (x+1). Conditions (i), (ii), (iii) all follow from the following Lemma (that in turn directly follows from the definition of f(x)):
%C A144926 Lemma. The values of f(1) and f(-1) are even but different modulo 4.
%C A144926 To prove (i), it is enough to notice that if f(x) were divisible by (x - 1) and (x + 1), then f(1) = f(-1) = 0, a contradiction to the Lemma. To prove (ii), suppose that f(x) = c(p,x) * q(x) for some integer polynomial q. Then f(1) = p * q(1), together with the Lemma and primality of p implying that f(1) = -2p, 0, or 2p. But it is easy to see that if f(1)=0, then (x-1) divides f(x); while if f(1) = -2p or 2p, then (x+1) divides f(x). Condition (iii) is proved similarly to (ii).
%C A144926 From (i), (ii), (iii), it follows that to compute A144926(2p) it is enough to compute the number of such f(x) that are divisible by (x-1) and the number of such f(x) that are divisible by (x+1) and add up these numbers. Clearly, each of these numbers equals binomial(2p,p) that completes the proof. - _Vladeta Jovovic_, Oct 02 2008
