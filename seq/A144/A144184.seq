%N A144184 Decimal expansion of the convergent to the recurrence x = 1/(x^(1/x)-1/x-1) for all starting values of x >= 3.
%C A144184 1/(x^(1/x)-1/x-1) ~ pi(x), the number of prime numbers <= x. This is comparable to the well known approximation Pi(x) ~ x/(log(x)-1). As x -> infinity, pi(x) - 1/(x^(1/x)-1/x-1) -> 1/2 as x-> infinity. This was derived from my original n-th root formula 1/(x^(1/x)-1) ~ pi(x). The convergent of the recurrence x = 1/(x^(1/x)-1) = 2.293166287... is expanded in A085846 and is referred to as Foias constant. The convergents 5.507985652... and 2.293166287... are both roots of 1/(x^(1/x)-1/x-1)-x = 0. 2.293166287... is also a root of 1/(x^(1/x)-1) - x = 0.
%C A144184 We have here examples of functions, f(x), for which we can solve for a root by recursion of the variable x. Another simple example is the recursion x = 1/(x+1).

%F A144184 The convergent used to generate this sequence, 5.50798565277317825758902..., is computed with the recurrence x = 1/(x^(1/x)-1/x-1) and can also be found by solving for the roots of 1/(x^(1/x)-1/x-1)-x = 0.
