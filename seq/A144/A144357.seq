%N A144357 Partition number array, called M31(-1), related to A049403(n,m) = S1(-1;n,m) (generalized Stirling triangle).
%C A144357 Each partition of n, ordered as in Abramowitz-Stegun (A-St order; for the reference see A134278), is mapped to a nonnegative integer a(n,k) =: M31(-1;n,k) with the k-th partition of n in A-St order.
%C A144357 The sequence of row lengths is A000041 (partition numbers) [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 22, 30, 42, ...].
%C A144357 First member (K=1) in the family M31(-K) of partition number arrays.
%C A144357 If M31(-1;n,k) is summed over those k with fixed number of parts m one obtains the unsigned triangle S1(-1) := A049403.
