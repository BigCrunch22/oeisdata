%N A144146 A positive integer k is included if every nonzero exponent in the prime factorization of k is coprime to k.
%C A144146 1 is included somewhat arbitrarily. 1 has no nonzero exponents in its prime factorization, but it also has no prime factorization exponents that are not coprime to 1.
%C A144146 The numbers of terms not exceeding 10^k, for k = 1, 2, ..., are 9, 75, 746, 7433, 74270, 742714, 7427050, 74270567, 742705640, 7427055214, ... . Apparently, the asymptotic density of this sequence exists and equals 0.742705... .  - _Amiram Eldar_, Feb 11 2024

%e A144146 40 has the prime-factorization 2^3 * 5^1. The exponents are therefore 3 and 1. Since both 3 and 1 are coprime to 40, then 40 is included in the sequence.
