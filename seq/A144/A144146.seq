%N A144146 A positive integer n is included if every nonzero exponent in the prime factorization of n is coprime to n.
%C A144146 1 is included somewhat arbitrarily. 1 has no nonzero exponents in its prime factorization, but it also has no prime factorization exponents that are not coprime to 1.

%e A144146 40 has the prime-factorization 2^3 * 5^1. The exponents are therefore 3 and 1. Since both 3 and 1 are coprime to 40, then 40 is included in the sequence.
