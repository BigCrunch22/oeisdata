%N A144096 A positive integer n is included if at least one of the exponents of the prime-factorization of n does not occur anywhere in n when the exponents and n are represented in base 2.
%C A144096 A144095(n) = A001221(n) if n is not included in this sequence.
%e A144096 40 has the prime-factorization 2^3 * 5^1. So the exponents are 3 and 1. 40 in binary is 101000. 3 = 11 in binary. 11 does not occur anywhere in 101000. 1 is 1 in binary. 1 does occur (twice) in 101000. At least one exponent (3 = 11 in binary) does not occur in 101000 (= 40 in decimal), so 40 is in the sequence.
