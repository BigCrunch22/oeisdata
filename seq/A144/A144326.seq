%N A144326 Prime numbers that cannot be Mersenne prime exponents, by conjecture of A144325.
%C A144326 Obviously true for the initial terms!
%C A144326 Conjecture: 191, 1217, 1559 and 1901 are not in fact members of this sequence, noting that they are (4, 19) k-figurate numbers; 19 is a member of A138694. Determining whether a Mersenne prime exponent one greater than a (4, 19) k-figurate number exists is sufficient to determine whether these primes are members.
