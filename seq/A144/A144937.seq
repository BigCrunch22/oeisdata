%N A144937 Number of hyperforests with n labeled vertices when edges of size 1 are allowed (with no two equal edges), with at least one component of order 1.

%F A144937 a(n) = A134956(n) - A144935(n).
%e A144937 For n=2 we do not have an hypertree of order 2. The possibilities are one forest, two hyperforests composed by one loop plus one tree and one hyperforest composed by two loops. So a(2)=4.
%Y A144937 Cf. A134956(hyperforests), A144935(hyperforests without components of order 1).
