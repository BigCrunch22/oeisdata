%N A144671 Numbers n such that omega(n) = omega(2^n-1), where omega = A001221 = number of distinct prime factors.
%C A144671 A prime p is in this sequence iff 2^p-1 is prime, thus iff p is in A000043 (Mersenne prime exponents), which is a subsequence of this one - and of A155990. The latter contains (some) powers of primes, which cannot be the case here.
%e A144671 a(1) = 1 is in this sequence since omega(1) = 0 = omega(2^1-1). Elements of A000043 are primes p such that 2^p-1, they are in this sequence since omega(p) = 1 = omega(2^p-1). a(5) = 6 is in this sequence since omega(6) = #{2,3} = 2 = omega(2^6-1) = #{3,7}.
