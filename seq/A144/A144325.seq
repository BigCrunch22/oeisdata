%N A144325 Prime numbers p such that p - 1 is the third a-figurate number, sixth b-figurate number and possibly twelfth c-figurate number for some a, b and c and not a d-figurate number for any nontrivial d.
%C A144325 Every member is congruent to 7 modulo 10.
%C A144325 The 12th Mersenne prime exponent (Mpe, A000043) 127 is a member: 126 is the third 43-figurate number and the sixth 10-figurate number and is not a k-figurate number for any other k except 126 (trivially). Several other Mersenne prime exponents are members of this sequence; the next is 607.
%C A144325 It is conjectured:
%C A144325 - that this sequence is infinite;
%C A144325 - that there is a unique set {3, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, ...} giving the possible orders in k-figurate numbers for the set S of all Mpe for which Mpe - 1 is a (3, ...) k-figurate number;
%C A144325 - that the ratio of Mpe in S to those not approaches one;
%C A144325 - that a characteristic function f(n) exists which equals 1 iff n is in S;
%C A144325 - that all Mersenne primes greater than thirty-one can be characterized by this entry, A144313 and A144315; or by no more than two additional sequences related to (4, 52) and (4, 187) k-figurate numbers.
