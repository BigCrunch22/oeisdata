%N A144774 Number of positive integers k less than n such that rad(k) < rad(n).
%C A144774 a(n) = n - 1 if n is a product of distinct primes, since these have rad(n) = n.
%e A144774 rad(1) = 1 and rad(2) = 2, so a(2) = 1.
%e A144774 rad(4) is also 2, so a(4) = 1.
%e A144774 rad(12) = 6. The integers k less than 12 for which rad(k) < 6 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9. a(12) = 7.
