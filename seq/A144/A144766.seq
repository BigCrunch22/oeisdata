%N A144766 Terms in A144719 that are themselves decimal palindromes.
%C A144766 Presumed infinite, but it is difficult to find more terms.
%C A144766 The earlier claim that this sequence is a subsequence of A046450 was incorrect, as the counterexample of 7673767 =97*79111 shows. The reason is that A046450 checks only concatenations in the natural order of the prime factors, but this sequence here allows for both orders, 97//79111 as well as 79111//97, to be palindromic. - _R.
