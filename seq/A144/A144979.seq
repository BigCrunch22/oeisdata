%N A144979 Number of hyperforests on n unlabeled nodes, assuming that each edge contains at least two nodes, with all components of prime orders.

%F A144979 a(n) = Sum of prod_{k=1..n} C(A035053(k)+c_k-1,c_k}) over the partitions of n having all parts k prime, c_1 + 2c_2 + ... + nc_n; c_1, c_2, ..., c_n >= 0.
%e A144979 a(5) = 11 since the only options are 9 hypertrees of order 5, or the two hyperforests composed by components of order 3 and 2.
%Y A144979 Cf. A035053 (hypertrees), A000040 (prime numbers).
