%N A144642 Positive numbers that are not the sum of a triangular number, a square and a Fibonacci number.
%C A144642 Prompted by a conjecture of _Zhi-Wei Sun_ (now known not to be true) that every number can be written in the stated form.
%C A144642 A number n = x^2 + y*(y+1)/2 + F_m if and only if 8*n+1 = 8*x^2 + (2*y+1)^2 + 8*F_m, if and only if 8*n + 1 - 8*F_m = 8*x^2 + (2*y+1)^2 for some m >= 0. Now if M == 1 (mod 8) (e.g. M = 8*n + 1 -8*F_m), then M = 8*x^2 + (2*y+1)^2 if and only if the exact prime-power exponent of each prime p == 5 or 7 (mod 8) which divides M is even.
%C A144642 a(10) was found by _D. S. McNeil_ in 12/2008.
