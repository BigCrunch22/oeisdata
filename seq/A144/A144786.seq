%N A144786 If n is an oblong number A002378, then a(n)=a(j) where j is the number of oblong numbers in (0,n], otherwise a(n)=n.

%C A144786 where the first few denominators of 1/n = 1/b(1)+1/b(2)+... have been tabulated.
%C A144786 For some sets of n, the list b(i) of denominators is essentially the same: consider for example A000058, which represents primarily n=1, then in truncated form also n=2, and then n=6, n=42 etc. Or consider A082732 which represents n=3, then in truncated form n=12, n=156 etc.
%C A144786 The OEIS sequence assigns the primary n to a(n). The interpretation of a(n) with ascending n is: n=1 is primary, a(1)=1.
%C A144786 Decomposition of n=2 is equivalent to n=1, a(2)=1. Cases n=3 to 5 are primary ("original", "new"), and a(n)=n in these cases. n=6 is not new but essentially the same Egyptian series as seen for n=1, so a(6)=1. Cases n=7 to n=11 are "new" sequences, again a(n)=n in these cases, but then n=12 is represented by A082732 as already seen for n=3, so a(12)=3.
%C A144786 Because the first denominator for the decomposition of 1/n is 1/(n+1), n+1 belongs to the sequence of denominators of the expansion of 1/a(n).
%C A144786 The sequences b(.) have recurrences which are essentially 1+b(n-1)*(b(n-1)-1), looking up the oblong number at the position of the previous b(.). This is the reason why reverse look-up of the n via A000194 (number of oblong numbers up to n) as used in the definition is equivalent to the assignment described above.
%F A144786 a(n) = a(A000194(n+1)) if n in A002378. a(n) = n if n in A078358.
%e A144786 n=1 is not in A002378, so a(1)=1.
%e A144786 n=2 = A000058(2), so a(2)=1 because there is 1 oblong number <=2 and >0.
%e A144786 n=3 is not in A002378, so a(3)=3.
%e A144786 n=6 = A000058(3), so a(6)=a(2) because there are 2 oblong numbers <=6 and >0.
