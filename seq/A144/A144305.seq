%N A144305 Triangle read by rows: prime numbers p(n) along left edge (n, 1) and totient phi(n) along right edge (n, n), with (n, k) = (n - 1, k - 1) + (n - 1, k) for 1 < k < n when n > 2.
%C A144305 (1, 1) = 1 is considered a member of both sequences.
%C A144305 If (n, n - 1) is a prime p, n is less than or equal to the index of p (A049084(p) + 1) and strictly less if n >= 8: (8, 7) = 19 and (9, 1) = 19.
%C A144305 If (n, k) is a prime p, with n > 3 and 1 < k < n - 1, then n < A049084(p) + 1: (5, 2) = (5, 3) = 11 and (6, 1) = 11.
%C A144305 Excluding the right edge, the triangle has deteriorating symmetry about its midline until n = 12: (12, 5) = 988 and (12, 7) = 990.
%C A144305 The diamond of symmetry ends with (11, 5) = (11, 6) = 558 and coincidentally 11 is the last row which could be entered.
%C A144305 There is a related triangle which begins with p(1) = 2 and phi(1) = 1 on the first row, omitting the peak:
%C A144305 2 1
%C A144305 3 3 1
