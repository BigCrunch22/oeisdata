%N A144147 A positive integer n is included if every exponent in the prime-factorization of n is coprime to n and if the sum of these prime-factorization exponents divides n.
%C A144147 All primes are included in the sequence. Any integer = 2*(odd prime) is included in the sequence. This sequence contains those terms in both sequence A074946 and sequence A144146.
%e A144147 40 has the prime factorization of 2^3 * 5^1. The exponents are therefore 3 and 1. Both 3 and 1 are coprime to 40. And 3+1 = 4 divides 40. So 40 is included in the sequence.
