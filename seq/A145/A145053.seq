%N A145053 One-third of the number of n X n nonnegative integer arrays with every 3 X 3 subblock summing to 2.
%C A145053 Second differences of (a(3k), a(3k + 1), a(3k + 1)) and (a(3k + 1), a(3k + 2), a(3k + 3)) appear to be 48 * 9^(k - 1). Based on this conjecture, we would have a(15) =  306435. - _David A. Corneth_, Apr 15 2015
