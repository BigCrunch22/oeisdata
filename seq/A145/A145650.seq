%N A145650 Linking prime for the first and second member of maximal chains of primes that have at least three members.
%C A145650 A sequence of consecutive primes prime(k), ..., prime(k+r), r >= 1, is called a chain of primes if i*prime(i) + (i+1)*prime(i+1)* is prime (the linking prime for prime(i) and prime(i+1), cf. A119487) for i from k to k+r-1. A chain of primes prime(k), ..., prime(k+r) is maximal if it is not part of a longer chain, i.e., if neither (k-1)*prime(k-1) + k*prime(k) nor (k+r)*prime(k+r) + (k+r+1)*prime(k+r+1) is prime.
%C A145650 A145651 gives the linking prime for the second and third member of maximal chains of primes that have at least three members.

%e A145650 Primes 13, 17, 19, 23 have prime indices 6, 7, 8, 9. 6*13 + 7*17 = 197 is prime; 7*17 + 8*19 = 271 is prime; 8*19 + 9*23 = 359 is prime. Neither 5*11 + 6*13 = 133 nor 9*23 + 10*29 = 497 is prime, so 13, 17, 19, 23 is maximal. Hence 6*13 + 7*17 = 197, the linking prime for 13 and 17, is in the sequence.
