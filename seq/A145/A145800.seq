%N A145800 a(n) = the smallest positive integer that is an (odd) palindrome when represented in binary and that contains within it the binary representation of n.
%C A145800 For n is a power of 2 (A000079), a(n) = 2*n + 1.
%C A145800 This sequence contains, by definition, those binary palindromes that are odd, i.e., those palindromes without leading zeros. In other words, only integers occurring in sequence A006995 occur in this sequence.
%C A145800 a(A006995(n)) = A006995(n). - _Ray Chandler_, Oct 26 2008

%e A145800 6 in binary is 110. Those integers which contain 110 in their binary representations are 6 (110 in binary), 12 (1100 in binary), 13 (1101 in binary), 14 (1110 in binary), 22 (10110 in binary), 24 (11000 in binary), 25 (11001 in binary), 26 (11010 in binary), 27 (11011 in binary), etc... Now, 27 (11011 in binary) is the smallest of these integers that is a binary palindrome; so a(6) = 27.
