%e A145652 The subsequence of terms a(27) through a(29) in reversed order is (a(29),a(28),a(27)) = (3,3,2). This occurs in the first 29 terms of sequence A145652 like so: 1,1,2,1,3,1,(3,3,2),1,2,3,5,1,1,2,2,2,3,2,2,5,1,1,2,2,2,3,3. On the other hand, the subsequence of terms a(26) to a(29) in reversed order, (3,3,2,2) does not occur anywhere among the first 29 terms of sequence A145652. Since there are three terms in (3,3,2), then a(30) = 3.
