%N A145832 Numbers k such that for each divisor d of k, d + k/d is "round" ("square-root smooth").
%C A145832 A necessary condition is that the number be one less than a round number; if this number is prime it's in the sequence.
%C A145832 Even composites in this sequence seem rare (see examples below for more details).

%e A145832 The first term is a prime one less than the round number 4.
%e A145832 The first composite number in this sequence is 15, with divisor-pair sum 3+5 = 8.
%e A145832 Another such composite is 63, with divisor-pair sums: 3+21 = 24, 7+9 = 16.
%e A145832 There are only five even composites among the first 100 terms of this sequence.
%e A145832 The first such is 146, with divisor-pair sum 2+73 = 75. The second is 164, with divisor-pair sums 2+82 = 84 and 4+41 = 45. The remaining three are 458, 524 and 584.
