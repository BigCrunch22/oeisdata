%N A145049 Primes of the form 4k+1 for which s=17 is the least positive integer such that sp-(floor(sqrt(sp)))^2 is a square.
%e A145049 a(1)=3037 since p=3037 is the least prime of the form 4k+1 for which sp-(floor(sqrt(sp)))^2 is not a square for s=1..16, but 17p-(floor(sqrt(17p)))^2 is a square (for p=3037 it is 100).
