%N A145532 Number of numbers removed in each step of Eratosthenes's sieve for 5!.
%C A145532 The number of steps in Eratosthenes's sieve for n! is A133228(n).
%C A145532 The number of primes less than 5! is 120 - 59 - 19 - 7 - 4 - 1 = 30 = A003604(5).
%e A145532 a(1)=59 because in first step we removed all numbers divisible by 2 (=60) with the exception of the first one, i.e., 2.
%e A145532 a(2)=19 because the number of numbers divisible by 3 and not divisible by 2 is 20 and we remove all with the exception of the first one, i.e., 3.
