%N A145853 Numbers m such that m is a multiple of all integers smaller than the largest prime dividing m.
%C A145853 The definition "Numbers m such that if m is a multiple of a number k, then m is a multiple of all integers less than k" produces the finite sequence 1, 2.
%C A145853 A007694 (numbers m such that phi(m) divides m) is a subsequence. - _Klaus Brockhaus_, Oct 23 2008
%C A145853 Numbers m such that for p prime p|m => A003418(p)|m. - _David W. Wilson_, Jan 05 2019

%e A145853 30 does not qualify because it is divisible by prime number 5 but not by 4 < 5. However, the fact that 32 is divisible by 4 but not by 3 < 4 does not disqualify 32 from being in this sequence because 4 is not prime.
