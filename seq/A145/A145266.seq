%N A145266 A positive integer n is included if there does not exist a positive integer m such that Sum{k>=0} floor(n/(m+k)) = n.
%C A145266 This sequence is the complement of sequence A145265. A145264(a(n)) = 0.
%C A145266 Does this sequence contain all of those and only those, positive integers that are congruent to 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17 (mod 18)? - _Leroy Quet_, Oct 31 2008
%e A145266 Checking n = 8: floor(8/3) + floor(8/4) + floor(8/5) + floor(8/6) + floor(8/7) + floor(8/8) = 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8. So 8 is not included in the sequence. Checking n = 6: floor(6/2) + floor(6/3) + floor(6/4) + floor(6/5) + floor(6/6) = 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8, which is > 6. But floor(6/3) + floor(6/4) + floor(6/5) + floor(6/6) = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5, which is < 6. So 6 is included in the sequence.
