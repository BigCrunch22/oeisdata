%N A145672 a(n) = size of the n-th term in S(3) (defined in Comments).
%C A145672 Let H(L,b) be the Hamming graph whose vertices are the sequences of length L over the alphabet {0,1,...,b-1} with adjacency being defined by having Hamming distance 1. Let P(L,b) be the subgraph of H(L,b) induced by the set of vertices which are base b representations of primes with L digits (not allowing leading 0 digits). Let S(b) be the sequence of all components of the graphs P(L,b), L>0, sorted by the smallest prime in a component.
