%N A145667 a(n) = number of components of the graph P(n,2) (defined in Comments).
%C A145667 Let H(n,b) be the Hamming graph whose vertices are the sequences of length n over the alphabet {0,1,...,b-1} with adjacency being defined by having Hamming distance 1. Let P(n,b) be the subgraph of H(n,b) induced by the set of vertices which are base b representations of primes with n digits (not allowing leading 0 digits).
