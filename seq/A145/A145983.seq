%N A145983 a(n) = least k such that either 6*k*M(n)-1 or 6*k*M(n)+1 or both is prime, where M(i)= i-th Mersenne prime.
%C A145983 All terms correspond to certified primes using PFGW from primeform group.
%e A145983 6*1*(2^2-1)-1 = 17 is prime as is 19 so a(1) = 1. 6*1*(2^3-1)-1 = 41 is prime as is 43 so a(2) = 1. 6*1*(2^5-1)-1 = 185 is not prime and 187 is not prime; 6*2*(2^5-1)-1 = 381 is not prime but 383 is prime so a(3) = 2.
