%N A145047 Primes p of the form 4k+1 for which s=10 is the least positive integer such that sp-(floor(sqrt(sp)))^2 is a square.
%C A145047 Conjecture: The least positive integer s can take values only from A008784 (see for s=1,2,5,10 sequences A145016, A145022, A145023 and this sequence).
%e A145047 a(1)=1237 since p=1237 is the least prime of the form 4k+1 for which sp-(floor(sqrt(sp)))^2 is not a square for s=1..9, but 10p-(floor(sqrt(10p)))^2 is a square (for p=1237 it is 49).
%Y A145047 Cf. A145016, A145017, A145022, A145023, A008784.
