%N A145649 Characteristic function of the lucky numbers.
%C A145649 Is there an efficient formula for this sequence? To wit, is there an algorithm for determining whether n is a lucky or unlucky number which is substantially faster than determining the lucky numbers up to n? - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Nov 24 2021
