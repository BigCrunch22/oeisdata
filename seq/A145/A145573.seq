%N A145573 Characteristic partition array for partitions without part 1.
%C A145573 The partitions are ordered according to Abramowitz-Stegun (A-St order). See e.g. A036040 for the reference, pp. 831-2.
%C A145573 The row lengths of this array are p(n)=A000041(n) (number of partitions of n).
%C A145573 The entries of row n are grouped together for partitions with rising parts number m from 1 to n. The number of partitions of n with m parts is p(n,m)= A008284(n,m), m=1..n, n>=1.
%C A145573 For the array without zeros see A145574.
%H A145573 W. Lang and M. Sjodahl <a href="/A145573/a145573.txt">First 10 rows of the array and row sums.</a>
%F A145573 As array: a(n,k)=1 if the k-th partition of n in A-St order has no part 1, and a(n,k)=0 else.
%F A145573 Translated into the sequence a(m) entry: a(n,k) = a(sum(p(k),k=1..n)+k).

%e A145573 a(4,3) = a(1+2+3+3) = a(9) = 1 because a(4,3) belongs to the partition [2^2]=[2,2] of n=4 which has no part 1.
%Y A145573 Cf. A145574 (without zeros). A002865 (row sums).
