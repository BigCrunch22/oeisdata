%N A145048 Primes p of the form 4k+1 for which s=13 is the least positive integer such that sp-(floor(sqrt(sp)))^2 is a square.
%e A145048 a(1)=2749 since p=2749 is the least prime of the form 4k+1 for which sp-(floor(sqrt(sp)))^2 is not a square for s=1..12, but 13p-(floor(sqrt(13p)))^2 is a square (for p=2749 it is 16).
