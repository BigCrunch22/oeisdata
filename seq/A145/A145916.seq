%e A145916 5246 = 2*43*61 is even and composite and has three distinct prime factors, 1, 2, 43, 61, 86, 122, 2623, 5246 are its divisors. 1+5246/1 = 5246+5246/5246 = 5247 = 3^2*11*53 and 53 < 72 < sqrt(5247); 2+5246/2 = 2623+5246/2623 = 2625 = 3*5^3*7 and 7 < 51 < sqrt(2625); 43+5246/43 = 122+5246/122 = 165 = 3*5^11 and 11 < 12 < sqrt(165); 61+5246/61 = 86+5246/86 = 147 = 3*7^2 and 7 < 12 < sqrt(147). Hence 5246 is in the sequence.
