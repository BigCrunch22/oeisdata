%N A145575 Characteristic partition array for partitions with distinct parts.
%C A145575 The partitions are ordered according to Abramowitz-Stegun (A-St order). See e.g. A036040 for the reference, pp. 831-2.
%C A145575 Partitions with distinct parts could be called fermionic partitions, because the places 1,...,n for the possible parts are either empty or once occupied.
%C A145575 The row lengths of this array are p(n)=A000041(n) (number of partitions of n).
%C A145575 The entries of row n belong to partitions with rising parts number m from 1 to n. The number of partitions of n with m parts is p(n,m)= A008284(n,m), m=1..n, n>=1.
%C A145575 For the array without zeros see A008289.
%H A145575 Wolfdieter Lang, <a href="/A145575/a145575.pdf">First 10 rows of the array.</a>
%F A145575 As array: a(n,k)=1 if the k-th partition of n in A-St order has distinct parts, and a(n,k)=0 else.
%F A145575 Translated into the sequence a(m) entry: a(n,k) = a(sum(p(k),k=1..n)+k).
