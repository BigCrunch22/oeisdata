%N A348066 Matula-Goebel tree number of tree n with all duplicate sibling subtrees reduced to one copy of each.
%C A348066 Here a subtree means a vertex and all its descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.).
%C A348066 Any subtree which is a duplicate of a sibling subtree is deleted and this is repeated until no duplicates exist. The order of deletions does not affect the result.
%C A348066 Or equivalently, duplicates among sibling subtrees are considered after each subtree has itself been reduced.
%C A348066 The resulting tree a(n) has no duplicates, which means asymmetric so that a(n) is a term of A276625. Reduction is no-change a(n) = n if and only if n is in A276625.
%C A348066 This sequence is a divisibility sequence since the prime factors of a(m*n) are the union of the prime factors of a(m) and a(n), so that a(m*n) is divisible by a(n).

%F A348066 a(n) = Product of distinct prime(a(primepi(p))), over p the prime factors of n.
%e A348066 In the following tree n=42, E and F are (singleton) subtrees of B and are the same so reduce to E alone. With that change, subtrees A,D and B,E are the same, so reduce to A,D alone.
