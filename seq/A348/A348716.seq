%N A348716 Numbers whose divisors can be partitioned into two disjoint sets without singletons whose harmonic means are both integers in a record number of ways.
%C A348716 The corresponding record values are 0, 1, 3, 10, 26, 198, 1093, 7035, 12391, 17625, ...
%e A348716 12 is the smallest number whose set of divisors can be partitioned into two disjoint sets whose harmonic means are both integers: {1, 2, 3, 6} and {4, 12}.
%e A348716 24 is the smallest number whose set of divisors can be partitioned into two disjoint sets whose harmonic means are both integers in three ways: ({3, 6}, {1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24}), ({1, 3, 6}, {2, 4, 8, 12, 24}) and ({1, 2, 3, 6}, {4, 8, 12, 24}).
