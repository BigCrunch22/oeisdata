%N A348873 After a(1) = 1, the sequence is always extended with the smallest divisor d (not yet present in the sequence) of the last term t. If d doesn't exist, we extend the sequence with 3*t + 1 and repeat. See the Comments section for more details.
%e A348873 a(1) = 1 by definition; as 1 has no available divisor yet present in the sequence, we produce a(2) = 3*1 + 1 = 4.
%e A348873 a(2) = 4; as 4 has 2 as its smallest divisor not yet present in the sequence, we have a(3) = 2;
%e A348873 a(3) = 2; as 2 has no available divisor yet present in the sequence, we produce a(4) = 3*2 + 1 = 7.
%e A348873 a(4) = 7; as 7 has no available divisor yet present in the sequence, we produce a(5) = 3*7 + 1 = 22.
%e A348873 a(5) = 22; as 22 has 11 as its smallest divisor not yet present in the sequence, we have a(6) = 11; etc.
