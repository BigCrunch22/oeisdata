%N A348719 Numbers whose divisors can be partitioned into two disjoint sets without singletons whose arithmetic means are integers in a record number of ways.
%C A348719 The corresponding record values are 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 16, 20, 21, 29, 198, 1542, 3448, 9055, 86081, 245107, 245145, 245336, 249208, 250595, 4844170, 31669733, ...
%e A348719 6 is the smallest number whose set of divisors can be partitioned into two disjoint sets whose arithmetic means are both integers: {1, 3} and {2, 6}.
%e A348719 12 is the smallest number whose set of divisors can be partitioned into two disjoint sets whose arithmetic means are both integers in three ways: ({1, 3}, {2, 4, 6, 12}), ({2, 6}, {1, 3, 4, 12}) and ({4, 12}, {1, 2, 3, 6}).
