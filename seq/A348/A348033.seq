%N A348033 Number of unitary divisors d of n such that sigma(d)*d is equal to n.
%C A348033 Differs from A327153 for the first time at n=72, where a(72)=0, while A327153(72) = 1.
%C A348033 Conjecture: For all terms x > 1 of A019278, a(x) = 0.
%C A348033 Question: Are there any terms larger than 1?
