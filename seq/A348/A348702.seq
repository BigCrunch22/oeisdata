%N A348702 Square array T(n, k) (n>=1, k>=1) read by antidiagonals upwards. T(n, k) is the number of partitions of the set [n] into lists of k noncrossing sets.
%C A348702 The sets may be empty. A list is an ordered set. The lists may even contain multiple empty sets.
%C A348702 As a square, the rows are the weighted partial sums of the rows of triangle A089231.
%C A348702 Given a partition P of the set {1, 2, ..., n} in a list of sets, a crossing in P are four integers [a, b, c, d] with 1 <= a < b < c < d <= n for which a, c are together in a set, and b, d are together in a different set. A list of noncrossing sets is a partition with no crossings.

%F A348702 T(n, k) = Sum_{j=1..k} binomial(k, j) k! N(n, k), for 1 <= k <= n. Where N(n, k) are the Narayana numbers of A001263.
%F A348702 T(n, k) = Sum_{j=1..k} binomial(k, j) A089231, for 1 <= k <= n; the rowwise weighted partial sum of the number of lists of k nonempty noncrossing sets of [n].

%e A348702 When adding the 6 list of crossing sets, lists with set sizes 2, 2 and 0 where 1 and 3 are in the same set, ({1, 3}, {2, 4}, {}), ..., ({}, {2, 4}, {1, 3}), then we have 81 partitions of {1, 2, 3, 4} into lists of sets. This is found in A089072(4, 3) = 81.
