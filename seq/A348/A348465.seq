%N A348465 a(n) = minimum L such that a ternary linear code of length L, dimension 6, and minimum distance n exists.
%C A348465 In other words, such that an [L,6,n]_3 code exists. In coding theory n usually denotes the length of the code, but OEIS conventions force us to use this nonstandard notation.
%C A348465 Sawashima-Maruta give a table for n <= 360 with only a few gaps, the first being at n = 19. It is known that a(19) is 33 or 34.
