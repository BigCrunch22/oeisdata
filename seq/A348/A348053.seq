%N A348053 Alternative version of A332493 (Skewes number for prime n-tuplets).
%C A348053 In contrast to A332493, in which "latest occurrence" is defined as the largest numerical value of the start of the n-tuplet, the maximum of the position of the occurrence is used here. This distinction is necessary for the first time with the term a(8), because there are 3 possible patterns of 8-tuplets. The 8-tuplet p + [0, 2, 6, 8, 12, 18, 20, 26] leads to A210439(8) = 1203255673037261. Of the two remaining candidates, p + [0, 2, 6, 12, 14, 20, 24, 26] leads to the Hardy-Littlewood prediction being exceeded at the 40634356th 8-tuplet with this pattern, the initial member of which is a(8)=523250002674163757. The other pattern p + [0, 6, 8, 14, 18, 20, 24, 26] leads to the 20316822th 8-tuplet with the beginning A332493(8) = 750247439134737983.
