%N A348452 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) (n >= 1, 1 <= k <= n^2) is the number of ways to tile an n X n chessboard with k rook-connected polyominoes of equal area.
%C A348452 The board has n^2 squares. The colors do not matter. T(n,k) is zero unless k divides n^2. The tiles are rook-connected polygons made from n^2/k squares.
%C A348452 This is the "labeled" version of the problem. Symmetries of the square are not taken into account. Rotations and reflections count as different.
%C A348452 A348453 (the main entry for this problem) displays the same data in a more compact way (by omitting the zero entries from each row).
%C A348452 The data is taken from A004003, A172477, and Schutzman & MGGG (2018).
