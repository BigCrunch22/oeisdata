%N A348365 Number of connected realizable graphs on n vertices.
%C A348365 a(n) is the number of realizable connected unlabelled graphs on n vertices. A realizable graph H is a graph for which there exists a (multi di)graph G such that the vertices of H are exactly the simple cycles of G and two vertices of H share an edge if the corresponding simple cycles in G share at least one vertex. Thus H encodes the "cycle skeleton" of G. Formally, H is the dependency graph of the trace monoid formed by the simple cycles on G equipped with the independency relation that two cycles commute if they are vertex-disjoint.

%F A348365 a(n) is strictly increasing, a(n+1)>a(n) and a(n) grows at least exponentially with n as n->infinity.
%e A348365 For n = 4, a(4) = 5 because out of the 6 unlabelled connected graphs on 4 vertices only 1 is not realizable: the square.
%Y A348365 Compare with A001349 (all graphs), sequence close to A048192.
