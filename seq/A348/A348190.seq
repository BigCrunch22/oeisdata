%N A348190 Positive integers where each is chosen to be the second smallest number subject to the condition that no three terms a(j), a(j+k), a(j+2*k) (for any j and k) form an arithmetic progression.
%C A348190 The sequence seems to behave in a similar way as the "forest fire" A229037. The graph (up to n=5000) looks like it has a fractal structure, with each dense "pillar" approximately double the size of the previous one.
%C A348190 The terms of this sequence do not seem to be larger (on average) than those of A229037, despite the construction of this sequence.

%e A348190 a(7) = 4, because 2 would form an arithmetic progression with a(1) = 2 and a(4) = 2 and 3 would form an arithmetic progression with a(5) = 3 and a(6) = 3. Therefore, 4 is the second smallest number which satisfies the condition (1 being the smallest).
