%N A348305 Number of fusion rings of multiplicity one and rank n.
%C A348305 The notion of fusion ring was introduced by G. Lusztig (1987). See the modern definition on page 60 of the book "Tensor Categories" (2015), in reference below.
%C A348305 It can be seen as a generalization of both finite group (based ring) and its representation (based) ring.
%C A348305 Combinatorially, it is just given by a finite set {1,...,n}, a bijection i->i^* (called dual map) and fusion coefficients N_{i,j}^k which are nonnegative integers satisfying the following axioms:
%C A348305 - Associativity: Sum_s N_{i,j}^s N_{s,k}^t = Sum_s N_{j,k}^s N_{i,s}^t,
%C A348305 - Neutral: N_{1,i}^j = N_{i,1}^j = delta_{i,j},
%C A348305 - Dual: N_{i^*,k}^{1} = N_{k,i^*}^{1} = delta_{i,k},
%C A348305 - Frobenius reciprocity: N_{i,j}^k = N_{i^*,k}^j = N_{k,j^*}^i.
%C A348305 The rank is just n. The multiplicity is the max of (N_{i,j}^k).
%C A348305 The fusion rings are considered up to equivalence.
%C A348305 There is a distinct fusion ring of multiplicity one and rank n for each finite group of order n (just take the group as finite set, the inverse as dual map and N_{g,h}^k = delta_{gh,k}), so a(n)>=A000001(n). The inequality is strict for n>1.
%C A348305 The above terms of the sequence were computed by J. Slingerland and G. Vercleyen (see paper in link below, Table 2 on page 6).
%C A348305 The six first terms were also computed independently by Z. Liu, S. Palcoux and Y. Ren (see link below, page 1).
%C A348305 The (optimized) code computing these terms may be too long to be put here.

%e A348305 For n=1, there is only the trivial fusion ring, so a(1)=1.
%e A348305 For n=2, there are only the fusion ring of the cyclic group C2 and the Yang-Lee fusion ring, so a(2)=2.
