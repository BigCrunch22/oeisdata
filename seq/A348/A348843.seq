%N A348843 Irregular triangle read by rows: row n gives for the Julian Green game with n cards labeled 1, 2, ..., n, for n >= 2, the number of games if the first removed card has label K = 2*k, for k = 1, 2, ..., floor(n/2).
%C A348843 The Ian Stewart links for the Juniper Green game are given in A348842.
%C A348843 The length of row n is A008619(n-2), for n >= 2.
%C A348843 The sum of row n gives A348842(n).
%C A348843 See A348844 for the table where the present entries are split into the number of games with odd and even number of moves.
%C A348843 T(n, K=2*k) is determined from the sequence of removed numbers in the Julian Green game with cards labeled 1, 2, ..., n, named JG(n), if the first removed card number is K. Such a sequence is obtained from row n of table A348390 which provides the possible card numbers (the reservoir) for the move following the sequence entry with card number q, for q from {1, 2, ..., n} (q is here the number k of A348390, giving the sequence of proper divisors of  d(n,k) followed by the sequence of multiples m(n, k) of k which are > k and <= n). However, numbers of the reservoir only qualify if they have not yet been removed in the game. E.g., a JG(5) game starting with {2}. The reservoir for the next entry (move) is {1, 4}, q = k = 2 from  row n = 5 of A348390. If the game continues as {2, 1}, the next move comes form the reservoir for q = 1, that is {2, 3, 4, 5}, but 2 has already been removed, that is, the game continues as {2, 1, 3} or {2, 1, 4} or {2, 1, 5}. The next move comes from reservoir {1} or {2,4} or {1} from q = 3 or 4, or 5, respectively, but these numbers have all to be omitted. Thus the three games have an odd number of moves (namely 3) and the player who starts (player A) wins. The game starting with {2, 4} continues as {2, 4, 1} (from q = 4 with reservoir {1, 2}, but 2 has to be omitted). The next move uses either number 3 or 5 (q = 1, {2, 3, 4, 5}, omitting 2 and 4). Then the game finishes either as {2, 4, 1, 3} or as {2, 4, 1, 5} because the reservoir {1} for q = 3 and also for q = 5 cannot be used. In these two cases the second player (B) wins. Thus there are 3 + 2 = 5 games for start number K = 2 if n = 5 (see also row 5, K = 2 in table A348844).
