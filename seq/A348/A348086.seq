%N A348086 Variation of the EKG sequence A064413: a(n) is the smallest number not already used which shares a factor with a(n-1) and has a different number of divisors than a(n-1).
%C A348086 This sequence uses the same rules as A064413 except with the additional restriction that a(n) must have a different number of divisors than a(n-1). Despite this additional restriction the overall behavior of the sequence is almost identical to A064413, with most values appearing only a few places away from their position in A064413.
%C A348086 The fixed points below 10000 are 1, 2, 8, 10, 14, 26, 32, 38, 259. It is likely no more exist.
%e A348086 a(9) = 16 as a(8) = 8 which shares a factor with 16, 16 is unused, and tau(8) = 4 does not equal tau(16) = 5. This is the first term that differs from A064413, the later having a(9) = 10, but tau(10) = 4 = tau(8) so is forbidden here.
