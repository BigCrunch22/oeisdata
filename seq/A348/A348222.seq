%N A348222 Number of uniquely-3-colorable graphs on n vertices.
%C A348222 A graph is uniquely 3-colorable if there is a unique partition of its vertex set into 3 independent sets. This implies that every proper 3-coloring of the graph has this partition as its set of color classes.
%F A348222 a(n) = A369227(n,3). - _Eric W. Weisstein_, Jan 16 2024
%e A348222 a(3) = 1 and  a(4) = 1 because the complete graph K3 and K4-e are the only such graphs on 3 and 4 vertices, respectively.
