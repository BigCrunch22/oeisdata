%N A348568 Highly composite numbers (A002182) such that the exponents of 2 and 3 in their prime factorization are equal.
%C A348568 These are all the terms in the sequence because for a number x that has exponents of 2 and 3 equal and >= 5 in its prime factorization, 8x/9 is a smaller number with at least the same number of divisors. Since 1516237305382800 is the greatest highly composite number that is not a multiple of 32, A134592(32), it is the last term of this sequence.
%F A348568 Intersection of A002182 and A064615.
%e A348568 1516237305382800 is highly composite and its prime factorization is 2^4 * 3^4 * 5^2 * 7^2 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 19 * 23 * 29 * 31. Since the exponents of 2 and 3 are both 4, 1516237305382800 is in this sequence.
