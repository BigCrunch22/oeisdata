%N A348867 Numbers whose numerator and denominator of the harmonic mean of their divisors are both 3-smooth numbers.
%C A348867 The terms that are also harmonic numbers (A001599) are those whose harmonic mean of divisors (A001600) is a 3-smooth number. Of the 937 harmonic numbers below 10^14, 38 are terms in this sequence.
%C A348867 If a term is not a harmonic number, then its numerator and denominator of the harmonic mean of its divisors are powers of 2 and 3, or vice versa.
%C A348867 If k1 and k2 are coprime terms, then k1*k2 is also a term. In particular, if k is an odd term, then 2*k is also a term.
