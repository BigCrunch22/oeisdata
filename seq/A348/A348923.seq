%N A348923 Numbers that are both unitary and nonunitary harmonic numbers.
%C A348923 a(7) > 10^12, if it exists.
%C A348923 For each term the two sets of unitary and nonunitary divisors both contain more than one element. The only number with a single unitary divisor is 1 which does not have nonunitary divisors. Numbers with a single nonunitary divisor are the squares of primes which are not unitary harmonic numbers. Therefore, this sequence is a subsequence of A348715.
%C A348923 Nonsquarefree numbers k such that A034448(k) divides k*A034444(k) and A048146(k) divides k*A048105(k). - _Daniel Suteu_, Nov 05 2021
%e A348923 45 is a term since the unitary divisors of 45 are 1, 5, 9 and 45, and their harmonic mean is 3, and the nonunitary divisors of 45 are 3 and 15, and their harmonic mean is 5.
