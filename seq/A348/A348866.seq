%N A348866 Composite numbers k such that A099378(k) | (A099377(k) + 1).
%C A348866 A disjoint union of the harmonic numbers (A001599) and the composite numbers whose harmonic mean of divisors is of the form m - 1/k, where m and k are integers.
%C A348866 If p is an odd prime, then the harmonic mean of its divisors is p*tau(p)/sigma(p) = p*A000005(p)/A000203(p) = p/((p+1)/2), so A099378(p) | (A099377(p) + 1). Therefore, this sequence is restricted to composite numbers.
%C A348866 This sequence is infinite. For example, it includes all the semiprimes of the form 3*p, where p == 2 (mod 3).
