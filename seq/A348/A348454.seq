%N A348454 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) (n >= 1, 1 <= k <= n^2) is the number of ways to tile an n X n chessboard with rook-connected polyominoes of area k.
%C A348454 This is an essentially identical triangle to A348452, except that the data in each row has effectively been reversed. Rather than copying everything here, please refer to A348452 for further information.
