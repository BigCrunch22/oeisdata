%N A348025 The numbers visited on a square spiral when stepping to the smallest unvisited number that is not visible from and shares a divisor > 1 with the current number. Start with 1 and 11.
%C A348025 A number is not visible from the current number if, given it has coordinates (x,y) relative to the current number, the greatest common divisor of |x| and |y| is greater than 1. The sequence has a(2) = 11 as that is the smallest number not visible from a(1) = 1.
%C A348025 In the first 10000 terms the longest single step is one at n = 6888 of length sqrt(22556) units between 22203 to 7389. The maximum difference between terms in the same range is from 3469 to 58973 at n = 9709.
