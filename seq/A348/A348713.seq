%N A348713 Numbers whose divisors can be partitioned into two disjoint sets with equal arithmetic mean.
%C A348713 The arithmetic mean of each of the two subsets is equal to the arithmetic mean of all the divisors of the number.
%C A348713 Also, numbers whose divisors can be partitioned into two disjoint sets with equal harmonic mean. This definition is equivalent since the harmonic mean of a subset {d_i} of the divisors of k is equal to k/<k/d_i>, where <k/d_i> is the arithmetic mean over the complementary divisors k/d_i.

%e A348713 6 is a term since its set of divisors, {1, 2, 3, 6}, can be partitioned into the two disjoint sets, {3} and {1, 2, 6}, whose arithmetic means are both 3.
