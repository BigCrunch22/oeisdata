%N A348264 a(n) is the number of iterations that n requires to reach a fixed point under the map x -> A348173(x).
%C A348264 a(n) first differs from A011765(n+2) at n = 84.
%C A348264 The fixed points are terms of A348004, so a(n) = 0 if and only if n is a term of A348004.
%C A348264 Conjecture: essentially partial sums of A219977 (verified for n <= 5000).

%e A348264 a(1) = 0 since 1 is in A348004.
%e A348264 a(2) = 1 since there is one iteration of the map x -> A348173(x) starting from 2: 2 -> 1.
%e A348264 a(84) = 2 since there are 2 iterations of the map x -> A348173(x) starting from 84: 84 -> 78 -> 39.
