%N A348881 After a(1) = 1, the sequence is always extended with the smallest divisor d (not yet present in the sequence) of the last term t. If d doesn't exist, we extend the sequence with 3*t - 1 and repeat. See the Comments section for more details.
%e A348881 a(1) = 1 by definition; as 1 has no available divisor not yet present in the sequence, we produce a(2) = 3*1 - 1 = 2.
%e A348881 a(2) = 2; as 2 has no available divisor yet present in the sequence, we produce a(3) = 3*2 - 1 = 5.
%e A348881 a(3) = 5; as 5 has no available divisor yet present in the sequence, we produce a(4) = 3*5 - 1 = 14.
%e A348881 a(4) = 14; as 14 has 7 as its smallest divisor not yet present in the sequence, we have a(5) = 7.
%e A348881 a(5) = 7; as 7 has no available divisor yet present in the sequence, we produce a(6) = 3*7 - 1 = 20.
