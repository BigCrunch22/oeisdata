%N A348215 a(n) is the sum of the iterated A348158 starting from n until a fixed point is reached.
%C A348215 The first odd number k with a(k) > 0 is k = 63.

%F A348215 a(n) = 0 if and only if n is in A326835.
%F A348215 a(2*n) > 0 for all n.
%e A348215 a(4) = 3 since the iterations of the map x -> A348158(x) starting from 4 are 4 -> 3.
%e A348215 a(64) = 120 since the iterations of the map x -> A348158(x) starting from 64 are 64 -> 63 -> 57, and 63 + 57 = 120.
