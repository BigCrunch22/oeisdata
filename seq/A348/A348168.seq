%N A348168 The list of all prime numbers is split into sublists with the 1st sublist L_1 = {2} and n-th sublist L_n = {p_1, p_2, ..., p_m}. a(n) is the largest m such that p_1 - p_0 > p_2 - p_1 = g, where p_0 = prevprime(p_1) and g is the maximum prime gap in L_n.
%C A348168 The gap between two consecutive primes in L_n is smaller than g_n-1 and g_n, where g_n is the gap between L_n and L_n+1. Sublists of length 2 are the most frequent ones and any pair of twin primes >= 11 stay in the same sublist.
%C A348168 Conjecture 1: lim_{n->oo} N_i/n = k_i, where N_i is the number of sublists consisting of i primes and k_i is a constant, with k_2 > k_1 > k_3 > k_4 > ....
%C A348168 Conjecture 2: lim_{n->oo} (Sum_{1..n} a(i))/n = Sum_{1..oo} i*k_i = e, meaning that, as n tends to infinity, the average length of sublists approaches 2.71828...(see the partial average - n plot in Links).

%e A348168 a(1) = 1 because L_1 = {2} by definition.
%e A348168 a(2) = 1. For the 2nd sublist, p_1 - p_0 = 3 - 2 = 1. If the next prime, 5, is in L_2, then p_2 - p_1 = 2 > p_1 - p_0. Therefore, 5 does not belong to L_2 and L_2 = {3}.
%e A348168 a(5) = 2. For the 5th sublist, p_1 - p_0 = 11 - 7 = 4. p_2 = 13 is in L_5 because p_2 - p_1 = 2 < p_1 - p_0. However, the next prime, 17, is not in L_5 as 17 - 13 > p_2 - p_1. Thus, L_5 = {11, 13}.
%e A348168 a(15) = 6. L_15 = {97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113}, because p_1 - p_0 = 97-89 > p_2 - p_1 = 101-97 = 4, which is the maximum prime gap in L_15. 127, the prime after 113, is not in L_15 as 127-113 = 14 > p_2 - p_1.
