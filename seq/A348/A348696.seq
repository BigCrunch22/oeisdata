%N A348696 Numbers m such that there is at least one smaller number k < m with the same harmonic mean of divisors as m.
%C A348696 The corresponding values of k (the least in case there are more than one) are 84, 120, 140, 864, 924, 420, 1092, 1428, 1320, 1596, ... (see the link for more values).
%C A348696 The least term m with more than one smaller number k with the same harmonic mean of divisors as m is m = a(1237) = A348697(1) = 321048 with k = 201096 and 296352.
