%N A348227 Coordination sequence for Wilkinson's 123-circle packing with respect to a circle of radius 1.
%C A348227 Wilkinson's 123-circle packing (that is my name for it) is a packing of non-overlapping circles in the plane, and can be seen in Figs. 1 and 1a. There are three sizes of circles: (a) radius 1, (b) radius 2, and (c) radius 3. Because 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2, there is a right-angled triangle (shown in red in Fig. 3, "Tiling of plane ...") which when repeatedly translated and reflected builds the whole structure.
%C A348227 A convenient set of coordinates for the centers are: (a) radius 1: the points (8*i, 6*j), (b) radius 2: the points (8*i, 6*j+3), and (c) radius 3: the points (8*i+4, 6*j), where i and j take all integer values.
%C A348227 Let G denote the graph (Fig 1, Fig. 2) whose nodes correspond to the centers of the circles, with an edge for every pair of circles that touch. There are three types of nodes, corresponding to the circles of types (a), (b), and (c).
%C A348227 The cells in the planar graph G form a tiling of the plane by two kinds of triangles (3-4-5 and 5-5-6).
%C A348227 The coordination sequences for the three types of nodes in G are the present sequence, A348229, and A348231.
%C A348227 If we draw tangent lines through the points where any two circles touch, we obtain a tiling of the plane (Fig. 3) with three kinds of tiles: squares, irregular hexagons, and irregular octagons.
%C A348227 The boundary lines of the tiles form the cpq net (thanks to _Davide M. Proserpio_ for this observation). See Fig. 4 and the RCSR link. This net is the dual graph to G. It has two kinds of nodes, whose coordination sequences are given in A348236 and A348237.

%e A348227 We start at a black point (with a(0) = 1). It is joined to 4 neighbors (so a(1) = 4), which in turn are joined to 12 further points (so a(2) = 12), which are joined to 20 additional points (so a(2) = 20), and so on.
