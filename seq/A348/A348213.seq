%N A348213 a(n) is the number of iterations that n requires to reach a fixed point under the map x -> A348158(x).
%C A348213 a(n) first differs from 1-A000035(n) at n = 63.
%C A348213 The number of iterations is finite for all n since A348158(n) <= n.
%C A348213 The fixed points are terms of A326835, so a(n) = 0 if and only if n is a term of A326835.

%e A348213 a(1) = 0 since 1 is in A326835.
%e A348213 a(2) = 1 since there is one iteration of the map x -> A348158(x) starting from 2: 2 -> 1.
%e A348213 a(64) = 2 since there are 2 iterations of the map x -> A348158(x) starting from 64: 64 -> 63 -> 57.
