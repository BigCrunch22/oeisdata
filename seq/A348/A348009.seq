%N A348009 Number of n-step self-avoiding walks on one quadrant of a 2D square lattice where the walk cannot step to the smaller square ring of numbers than the ring it is currently on.
%C A348009 This is a variation of A347990. The same walk rules apply except that the walk is confined to one quadrant of the 2D square lattice. See A347990 for further details.
%e A348009 a(0..3) are the same as the standard SAW on one quadrant of a square lattice, see A038373, as the walk cannot step to a smaller ring in the first three steps.
%e A348009 a(4) = 22. If we restrict the first one or more steps to the right followed by an upward step then there is one walk which steps to a smaller ring and is thus forbidden. That is the walk (0,0) -> (1,0) -> (2,0) -> (2,1) -> (1,1). As this can be walked in two different ways in one quadrant the number of 4-step walks becomes A038373(4) - 2 = 24 - 2 = 22.
%Y A348009 Cf. A347990 (four quadrants), A348008 (two quadrants), A038373, A001411, A337353.
