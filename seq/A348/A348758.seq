%N A348758 Times on a 12-hour digital clock with 6 digits at which the angle of the sector enclosing the three continuously moving hands of an analog clock has a local minimum.
%C A348758 The inclusion of the second hand leads to solutions differing from those of A120500. Apart from the perfect match at midnight or noon, the other minima are characterized by small angles > 0 between the hour and the minute hands and a coincidence of the second hand with one of the other two hands. It turns out that the coincidence of the minute and second hands never leads to the smaller angle value. The exact times in seconds are given by A348759, with rounding to nearest second applied to determine the terms of this sequence.
