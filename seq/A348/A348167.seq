%N A348167 Numbers whose binary representation contains a maximal set of nonconsecutive 1's.
%C A348167 These are the numbers that do not contain 11 and 000 in their binary representations (cf. A086638), and in addition do not have 00 as their two lowest-order bits.
%e A348167 5 is in this sequence, because its binary representation 101 cannot have any more ones added (below its highest nonzero bit) while preserving the property of having no two consecutive 1's.
%e A348167 4 is not in the sequence, because its binary representation 100 can be augmented to 101, producing another number in the sequence.
