%N A348961 Exponential harmonic (or e-harmonic) numbers of type 1: numbers k such that esigma(k) | k * d_e(k), where d_e(k) is the number of exponential divisors of k (A049419) and esigma(k) is their sum (A051377).
%C A348961 First differs from A005117 at n = 24, from A333634 and A348499 at n = 47, and from A336223 at n = 63.
%C A348961 Sándor (2006) proved that all the squarefree numbers are e-harmonic of type 1, and that an e-perfect number (A054979) is a term of this sequence if and only if at least one of the exponents in its prime factorization is not a perfect square.
%C A348961 Since all the e-perfect numbers are products of a primitive e-perfect number (A054980) and a coprime squarefree number, and all the known primitive e-perfect numbers have a nonsquare exponent in their prime factorizations, there is no known e-perfect number that is not in this sequence.

%e A348961 3 is a term since esigma(3) = 3, 3 * d_e(3) = 3 * 1, so esigma(3) | 3 * d_e(3).
