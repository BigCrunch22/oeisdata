%N A348844 Irregular triangle T(n,k) read by rows: row n gives the pairs of odd and even number of moves for the Juniper Green game JG(n) with n cards, for n >= 2, if the first card taken away is labeled K, for K = 2, 4, ..., 2*floor(n/2).
%C A348844 The Ian Stewart links for the Juniper Green game are given in A348842.
%C A348844 The length of row n is 2*A009619(n-2), for n >= 2.
%C A348844 The sum of row n is A348842(n).
%C A348844 In the irregular triangle A348843 the numbers of the pairs have been summed.

%e A348844 n = 2: The 1 = A348842(2) game JG(2) is [2, 1], with an even number of moves (B wins); hence row n = 2 is 0, 1, because there is no game with an odd number of moves. Thus JG(2) is called secondary.
%e A348844 n = 4: The 6 games JG(4) are: [2, 1, 3], [2, 1, 4]  and [2, 4, 1, 3] for K = 2, and [4, 1, 2], [4, 1, 3] and [4, 2, 1, 3], for K = 4; hence row n = 4 gives 2, 1, for K = 2 as well as for K = 4. This means that in these six games A wins four times and B twice. But B can always win by reacting on 2 with 4, and on 4 with 2, leading to [2, 4, 1, 3] and  [4, 2, 1, 3]. Thus the game JG(4) is called secondary.
%e A348844 n = 6: There are 35 games, A wins 19 times and B 16 times. For K = 2 and K = 6  6 times A, 6 times B, and for K = 4 4 times A and 7 times B. Again B is a safe winner reacting to K = 2 with 4 ([2, 4, 1, 5] or [2, 4, 1, 3]), to K = 4 with 2, then 5  ([4, 2, 1, 5]), and to K = 6 with 3 then 5 ([6, 3, 1, 5]). Thus JG(6) is also secondary.
%e A348844 n = 9: There are 216 games, A wins 117 times and B 99 times. There is a strategy for B, and JG(9) is secondary.
