%N A348022 The numbers visited on a square spiral when stepping to the smallest unvisited number that is visible from and shares a divisor > 1 with the current number. Start with 1 and 2.
%C A348022 A number is visible from the current number if, given it has coordinates (x,y) relative to the current number, the greatest common divisor of |x| and |y| equals 1. See A331400 for the points visible from the starting 1 number.
%C A348022 In the first 10000 terms the longest single step is one at n = 9942 of length sqrt(22570) units between 31002 to 10258. The maximum difference between terms in the same range is from 5171 to 36197 at n = 9977.

%e A348022 a(3) = 4 as gcd(4,2) = 2 and 4 is unvisited and visible from 2.
%e A348022 a(4) = 6 as gcd(4,6) = 2 and 6 is unvisited and visible from 4.
%e A348022 a(5) = 3 as gcd(3,6) = 3 and 3 is unvisited and visible from 6.
%e A348022 a(6) = 12 as gcd(12,3) = 3 and 12 is unvisited and visible from 3. Note although 9 is unvisited and gcd(9,3) = 3 it is not visible from 3 due to 2.
