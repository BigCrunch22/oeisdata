%N A227761 a(n) is the maximal difference between successive parts in the minimally runlength-encoded unordered partition of n (A227368(n)).
%C A227761 After n=3, only composites may obtain value 0. (But not all of them do; see A227762.) The first nine n for which a(n)=2 are 7, 13, 23, 33, 47, 61, 79, 97, 119, of which all are primes except 33 and 119. Conjecture: these values are given by A227786.
%C A227761 Are there any terms larger than 2?

%Y A227761 A227762 gives the positions of zeros, in other words, such n that their minimally runlength-encoded partition consists of identical parts.
