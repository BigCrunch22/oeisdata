%N A227148 Numbers n for which the sum of digits is even when n is written in the factorial base (A007623).
%C A227148 Numbers n for which minimal number of factorials needed to add to get n is even.
%C A227148 This sequence offers one possible analog to A001969 (evil numbers) in factorial base system. A227130 gives another kind of analog.
%C A227148 In each range [0,n!-1] exactly half of the integers are found in this sequence, and the other half of them are found in the complement, A227149.
%C A227148 The sequence gives the positions of even permutations in the tables A055089 and A195663; and equivalently, the positions of even numbers in A055091.
