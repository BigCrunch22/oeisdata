%N A227455 Sequence defined recursively: 1 is in the sequence, and k > 1 is in the sequence iff for some prime divisor p of k, p-1 is not in the sequence.
%C A227455 Consider a two-player game in which players take turns and a player given the position k = p_1^s_1 * ... * p_j^s_j must choose one of the j possible moves p_1 - 1, ..., p_j - 1, and the player's chosen move becomes the position given to the other player. The first player whose only possible move is 1 loses. Terms in this sequence are the winning positions for the player whose turn it is.

%e A227455 Numbers of the form 2^k are not in the sequence because their unique prime divisor is p = 2 and p-1 = 1 is in the sequence.
%e A227455 Numbers of the form 3^k are in the sequence because 3-1 = 2 is not in the sequence.
%e A227455 Numbers of the form 5^k are in the sequence because 5-1 = 4 = 2^2, and 2 is not in the sequence.
