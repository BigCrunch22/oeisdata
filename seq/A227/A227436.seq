%N A227436 Triangle T(n, k) of the number of n X n binary matrices with k = 0..n^2 1's and no more than three 1's in the corners of any square sub-block.
%C A227436 Rows are of lengths 2, 5, 10, ..., i^2+1,....
%C A227436 Every row starts with k = 0. For all n: T(n, 0) = 1.
%C A227436 The numbers are found by an exhaustive search among all (n^2, k)-combinations of 1's.
%C A227436 Another description of the sequence: Given a square grid with side n and n^2 points, T(n,k) is the number of ways to choose k points of the grid, so that no 4 of the chosen points form a square with sides parallel to the grid.
