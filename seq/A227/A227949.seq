%N A227949 Primes obtained by concatenating decremented numbers starting at a power of 10.
%C A227949 This sequence appears to its author to be part of a large coincidental feature of base 10 whose discovery began with A095694.
%C A227949 A227950 gives the digit lengths for this sequence and A227951 gives the number of consecutive values strung together. Combining these may help in the discovery of larger, as yet unknown, terms of this sequence (See FORMULA).
%F A227949 A227949(n) begins with 10^[(A227950(n)-1)/A227951(n)].
%e A227949 Since the concatenation of 10 and 9 produces the prime 109, the number 109 is in the sequence.
%e A227949 Since the concatenation of 100 and 99 produces the prime 10099, the number 10099 is in the sequence.
%e A227949 The concatenation of 100, 99, 98 does not produce a prime, hence 1009998 is not in the sequence.
%Y A227949 Cf. A173189, A096594, A172998.
