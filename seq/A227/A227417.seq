%N A227417 Integer triples a(3n-2) = n, a(3n-1) = n+4, and a(3n) = n+7.
%C A227417 Major chords: If we were to number the musical notes in increasing order of frequency starting with the key of C, we would get C as 1, C# as 2, D as 3 and so on until the next octave. My sequence comprises the keys that would make major chord sounds; for example, a C major chord would be 1,5,8, and a C# major chord would be 2,6,9, and so on.
