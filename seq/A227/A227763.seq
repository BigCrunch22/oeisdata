%N A227763 Winning positions in the misere version of the Subtract-a-Prime game.
%C A227763 Consider the following game: two players make moves in turn, initially the number on the board is n. Each move consists of subtracting a prime number that is at most the number on the board. The player who cannot play wins. This sequence is the set of winning positions in this game.
%t A227763 moves[n_]:= Table[n - Prime[i], {i, 1, PrimePi[n]}]; gana[n_]:= gana[n] = If[n < 2, True, !Select[moves[n], !gana[#]&]=={}]; Select[Range[155], gana[#] &]
