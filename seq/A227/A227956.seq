%N A227956 Possible lengths of minimal prime number rulers.
%C A227956 A ruler is a prime number ruler provided all its interior marks are on a prime number position. A ruler is called complete when any positive integer distance up to the length of the ruler can be measured. A complete ruler is called minimal when any subsequence of its marks is not complete for the same length. A complete ruler is perfect, if there is no complete ruler with the same length which possesses fewer marks. A perfect ruler is minimal (but not conversely). For definitions, references and links related to complete rulers see A103294.
%C A227956 The possible lengths of perfect prime number rulers are: 3, 4, 6, 8, 14, 18, 20, 24, 30, 32. There are 102 prime number rulers in total, 28 of which are minimal prime number rulers and 12 perfect prime number rulers.
%C A227956 a(n) is a finite subsequence of A008864.
