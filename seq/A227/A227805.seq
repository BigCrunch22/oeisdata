%N A227805 Sum of even numbers starting at 2, alternating signs.
%C A227805 Twice A195084. - _Joerg Arndt_, Aug 14 2013
%C A227805 The 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, ... "terms" increase by 2, the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, ... decrease by 2. Also the difference between the terms goes up by 2 each time. For example, the difference between 6 and 0 = 6, difference between 0 and 8 = 8, difference between 8 and -2 = 10, and so on.
%C A227805 Also the sequence seems to "mirror" a few terms before the 6, i.e.: -4, 10, -2, 8, 0, 6, 2, 4,[mirror],4, 2, 6, 0, 8, -2
