%N A227853 Numbers k such that 4620*k - 1 is a safe prime (A005385).
%C A227853 The given expression seems to produce safe primes quite frequently. The numbers 6*(4620*a(n)-1) form a subsequence of A230032.
%C A227853 Note that 4620 = 2^2*3*5*7*11.
%C A227853 Is a(4135..4139) = 59497..59501 the only set of 5 terms with common difference = 1? Checked for all terms up to 10^7. - _Zak Seidov_, Nov 02 2013
%C A227853 This is common because 4620 = 12*5*7*11 contains several small prime factors, which reduces the possible 12x-1 remainders, forcing all safe primes to be in other 12x-1 remainders mod 4620. Something similar would happen if 4620 were replaced with 12*5*7*13 = 5460. - _Mark Andreas_, Dec 31 2021
