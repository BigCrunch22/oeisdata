%N A227882 Known number of n_multiperfect numbers that can produce an hemiperfect of abundancy (2*n-1)/2.
%C A227882 The hemiperfect that are obtained are coprime to p = 2*n-1.
%C A227882 When p=2*n-1 is prime, if m is a n-multiperfect is such that valuation(m, p) = 1, then let's define k = m/p, sigma(k) = sigma(m/p) = sigma(m)/sigma(p) = (n*m)/(p+1) = (n*m)/(2*n) = m/2. So sigma(k)/k = m/(2*k) = (k*p)/(2*k) = p/2 = (2*n-1)/2.

%e A227882 a(2) = 1, since the only perfect number multiple of 3 is 6, and 6/3=2 has abundancy 3/2.
%e A227882 a(3) = 3, since the 3 known hemiperfect of abundancy 5/2 are coprime to 5.
%e A227882 a(5) = a(8) = a(11) = 0, since for those n, 2*n-1 is not prime.
%e A227882 a(10) is also 0, since all known 10-multiperfect are at least divisible by 19^2.
