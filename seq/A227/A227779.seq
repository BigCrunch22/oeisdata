%N A227779 Least splitter of s(n) and s(n+1), where s(n) = sum{(k + 1/2)^(-1/2), k >= 1}.
%C A227779 Suppose that x < y.  The least splitter of x and y is introduced at A227631 as the least positive integer d such that x <= c/d < y for some integer c; the number c/d is called the least splitting rational of x and y.  It appears that d=1 (i.e., c/d is an integer) for rationals c/d in positions given by A024206.
