%N A227963 Small equivalence classes (A227722) of subgroups of nimber addition (A190939).
%C A227963 Each entry of this sequence represents the same small equivalence class (sec) of Boolean functions as the corresponding entry of A190939. While A190939 represents each sec by the unique odd number among the numeric values of its functions, this sequence represents each sec by the smallest among these numbers (as an entry of A227722).
%C A227963 All big equivalence classes (bec) of Boolean functions are also small equivalence classes. So all entries in the sequence of sona-becs (A227960) are also in this sequence of sona-secs.
%C A227963 This sequence takes its order from A190939, so it is not monotonic. Thus it is not a subsequence of A227722, and does not contain A227960 as a subsequence.
%C A227963 First entries: 1, 3, 5, 6, 15, 17, 18, 51, 20, 85, 105, 24, 102, 90, 60, 255.
%C A227963 First entries in numerical order: 1, 3, 5, 6, 15, 17, 18, 20, 24, 51, 60, 85, 90, 102, 105, 255.

%e A227963 A190939(3) = 9. 9 belongs to the sec A227722(4) = 6. So a(3) = 6.
%e A227963 A190939(8) = 65. 65 belongs to the sec A227722(10) = 20. So a(8) = 20.
