%N A227946 Smallest m such that the number of iterations of "take odd part of phi" to reach 1 from m (A227944) is n.
%C A227946 The odd part of a number is its largest odd divisor (A000265), phi is Euler's totient function (A000010). - _Alonso del Arte_, Oct 13 2013
%F A227946 a(n) = smallest m such that A227944(m)=n.
%e A227946 a(1) = 2 because just one step is needed to reach 1 from 2, since phi(2) = 1. The numbers 3, 4, 5 and 6 also take one step.
%e A227946 a(2) = 7 because two steps are needed to reach 1 from 7: phi(7) = 6, the odd part of which is 3, and phi(3) = 2, the odd part of which is 1. The numbers from 8 to 18 take one or two steps to reach 1.
%e A227946 a(3) = 19 because three steps are needed to reach 1 from 19: phi(19) = 18, the odd part of which is 9, and phi(9) = 6, the odd part of which is 3, and phi(3) = 2, the odd part of which is 1.
