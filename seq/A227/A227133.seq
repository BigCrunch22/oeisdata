%N A227133 Given a square grid with side n consisting of n^2 cells (or points), a(n) is the maximum number of points that can be painted so that no four of the painted ones form a square with sides parallel to the grid.
%C A227133 a(1) through a(9) were found by an exhaustive computational search for all solutions. This sequence is complementary to A152125: A152125(n) + A227133(n) = n^2.
%C A227133 A064194(n) is a lower bound on a(n) (see the comments in A047999). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 18 2016
%C A227133 a(11) >= 71 (by extending the n=10 solution towards the southeast). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 12 2016
%C A227133 a(11) >= 73, a(12) >= 85, a(13) >= 98, a(14) >= 112, a(15) >= 127, a(16) >= 142 (see links). These lower bounds were obtained using tabu search and simulated annealing via the Ascension Optimization Framework. - _Peter Karpov_, Feb 22 2016; corrected Jun 04 2016
%C A227133 Note that n is the number of cells along each edge of the grid. The case n=1 corresponds to a single square cell, n=2 to a 2 X 2 array of four square cells. The standard chessboard is the case n=8. It is easy to get confused and to think of the case n=2 as a 3 X 3 grid of dots (the vertices of the squares in the grid). Don't think like that! - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 03 2016
%C A227133 a(12) = 85 and a(13) = 98 were obtained with a MIP model, solved with Gurobi in 141 days on 32 cores. - _Simon Felix_, Nov 22 2019
%C A227133 a(17) >= 158, a(18) >= 174, a(19) >= 192, a(20) >= 210. These lower bounds were obtained using simulated annealing. - _Dmitry Kamenetsky_, Dec 07 2024

%e A227133 n=9. A maximum of a(9) = 51 points (X) of 81 can be painted while 30 (.) must be left unpainted. The following 9 X 9 square is an example:

%e A227133 Here there is no subsquare with all vertices = X and having sides parallel to the axes.
