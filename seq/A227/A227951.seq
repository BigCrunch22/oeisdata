%N A227951 The number of consecutive values juxtaposed to obtain the value A227949(n).
%C A227951 Viewing the title-referenced sequence should make this sequence's meaning clear, and see that sequence's FORMULA combining values of this sequence and A227950's.
%C A227951 Some search effort for this particular sequence of the three was made, with a program expected to be more suited to it in terms of efficiency, to find a first value over 1000.  Nothing arose after a fairly long time period.
%e A227951 A227949(12)=100999897969594939291, so a(12)=10 as this concatenates the 10 numbers from 100 down to 91.
