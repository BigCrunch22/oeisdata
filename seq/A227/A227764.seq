%N A227764 Losing positions in the misere version of the Subtract-a-Prime game.
%C A227764 Consider the following game: two players make moves in turn; initially the number on the board is n. Each move consists of subtracting a prime number that is at most the number on the board. The player who cannot play wins. This sequence is the set of lost positions in this game.
%t A227764 moves[n_] := Table[n - Prime[i], {i, 1, PrimePi[n]}]; gana[n_] := gana[n] = If[n < 2, True, ! Select[moves[n], !gana[#] &] == {}]; Select[Range[155], !gana[#] &]
