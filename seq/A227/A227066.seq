%N A227066 Number of primes between n and 2n inclusive equals the number of primes between 2n and 3n inclusive.
%C A227066 There are almost certainly no more terms. Can anyone prove this conclusively?
%C A227066 The analogous sequence where the number of primes between 0 and n equals the number of primes from n to 2n is finite, consisting of only 2, 4, and 10. See Ehrhart. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jul 02 2013

%F A227066 Numbers n such that pi(3n) + pi(n-1) = 2pi(2n).
%e A227066 4 is not in the sequence since the interval [n,2n] = [4,8] contains two primes (5 and 7), while the interval [2n,3n] = [8,12] contains only one prime (11).
%e A227066 6 is in the sequence since the intervals [6,12] contains two primes (7 and 11), and the interval [12,18] also contains two primes (13 and 17).
