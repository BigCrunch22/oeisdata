%N A227803 Least splitter of s(n) and s(n+1), where s(n) = (1 - 1/n)^n.
%C A227803 Suppose that x < y.  The least splitter of x and y is introduced at A227631 as the least positive integer d such that x <= c/d < y for some integer c; the number c/d is called the least splitting rational of x and y.  Since s(n) -> 1/e, the sequence of least splitting rationals also approaches 1/e .
