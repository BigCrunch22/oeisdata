%N A227877 Number of ways to write n = x + y + z (x, y, z > 0) such that x*y and x*z are triangular numbers, and 6*y-1 and 6*z+1 are both prime.
%C A227877 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 4.
%C A227877 For n = 4*k - 1, we have n = (2k-1) + k + k with (2k-1)*k = 2k*(2k-1)/2 a triangular number. For n = 4*k + 1, we have n = (2k+1) + k + k with (2k+1)*k = 2k*(2k+1)/2 a triangular number.  For n = 4*k + 2, we have n = (2k+1) + k + (k+1), and (2k+1)*k = 2k*(2k+1)/2 and (2k+1)*(k+1) = (2k+1)(2k+2)/2 are both triangular numbers.
%C A227877 For n = 5*k, we have n = k + (2k-1) + (2k+1), and k*(2k-1) = 2k*(2k-1)/2 and k*(2k+1) = 2k*(2k+1)/2 are both triangular numbers. For n = 5*k - 2, we have n = k + (2k-1) + (2k-1) with k*(2k-1) = 2k*(2k-1)/2 a triangular number. For n = 5*k + 2, we have n = k + (2k+1) + (2k+1) with k*(2k+1) = 2k*(2k+1)/2 a triangular number.

%e A227877 a(77) = 1 since 77 = 1 + 10 + 66, and 1*10 = 4*5/2 and 1*66 = 11*12/2 are triangular numbers, and 6*10 - 1 = 59 and 6*66 + 1 = 397 are both prime.
