%N A227397 Related to Pisano periods: Numbers k such that the period of Fibonacci numbers mod k equals k+2.
%C A227397 This sequence is a subsequence of A220168, where k divides the Fibonacci number F(k+2). There is no discernible pattern among the terms of A220168 terms that are not in this sequence.
%C A227397 All terms are 2 less than a multiple of 6, and all except the first term (4) are 2 less than a multiple of 12.
