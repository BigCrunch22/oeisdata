%N A227185 The largest part in the unordered partition encoded in the runlengths of the binary expansion of n.
%C A227185 The bijective encoding of nonordered partitions via compositions (ordered partitions) present in the binary expansion of n is explained in A227184.
%C A227185 It appears that a(4n+2) = a(2n+1). - _Ralf Stephan_, Jul 20 2013

%F A227185 Defining formula:
%F A227185 a(0)=0; and for n>=1, a(n) = A029837(n+1) - (A005811(n)-1). [Because the largest part in the unordered partition in this encoding scheme is computed as (c_1 + (c_2-1) + (c_3-1) + ... + (c_k-1)) where c_1 .. c_k are the parts of the k-part composition that sum together as c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_k = A029837(n+1) (the binary width of n), so we subtract from the total binary width of n the number of runs (A005811) minus 1.]
%F A227185 Equivalently: a(n) = A092339(n)+1 for n>0.
%F A227185 a(n) = A005811(A129594(n)). [This just states the fact that when conjugating a partition, the largest part of an old partition will be the number of the parts in the new, conjugated partition.]
%e A227185 12 has binary expansion "1100", for which the lengths of runs (consecutive blocks of 0- or 1-bits) are [2,2]. Converting this to a partition in the manner explained in A227184 gives the partition {2+3}. Its largest part is 3, thus a(12)=3, which is actually the first time when this sequence differs from A043276.
