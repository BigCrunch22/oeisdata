%N A227202 Least prime, q, greater than the previous prime, p, which is a primitive root of p; beginning with 2.

%C A227202 Conjecture: a(n) < Prime[n*E].
%C A227202 The first prime absent from the sequence is 17, but it will join this sequence at 23.
%C A227202 The second prime absent from this sequence is 29, but it will join this sequence by going through 41 and then 47.
%C A227202 The third prime absent is 31 which joins at 47.
%C A227202 Conjecture: All primes will join this sequence eventually.
%e A227202 a(7) is not 17 because (13,17) = 1 but is 19 because (13,19) = -1.
