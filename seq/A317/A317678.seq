%N A317678 Sets of n distinct primes p_i in ascending order, written as triangle, such that S_n = Sum_{k=1..n} p_k is minimized and that there exists a compensation set of n primes q_j with q_j = n*p_j - Sum_{k=1..n,k!=j} p_k, j=1..n such that the set union {p_j} U {q_j} contains 2*n distinct primes and Sum_{k=1..n} q_k = S_n.
%C A317678 In case of ties, i.e., if more than one set exists for the same minimal sum S_n, the lexicographically least set is chosen. Since the condition of distinctness of {p_j} U {q_j} cannot be satisfied for n=1, the sets p = q = {1} are assumed to complete the triangle.
%C A317678 The minimal sums S_n are provided in A317680 and the corresponding compensation sets are provided in A317679. The compensation set is a solution to the "fair compensation" problem. n persons who own individual shares of p_i units of an asset agree to equally share those assets among themselves and a person n+1, who owns 0 units of this asset, but is willing to pay S_n units of compensation, e.g. money, to buy his share of S_n/(n+1) units of the asset. S_n/(n+1) doesn't need to be integer. q_j as defined above is a fair compensation for person j's relinquishment of assets by equipartitioning, assuming a constant price per asset.
