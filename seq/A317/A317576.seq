%N A317576 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of n X n tic-tac-toe positions (up to rotation and reflection) with k tokens (i.e., after k plays) which end a game (n > 0, 0 <= k <= n^2).
%C A317576 If k < n^2, T(n,k) is the number of positions where X (odd k) or O (even k) has won after k plays. T(n,n^2) = A317575(n,n^2) counts draws as well.
%C A317576 The number of draw positions is T(n,n^2) - A317573(n,n^2) for odd n and T(n,n^2) - A317574(n,n^2) for even n.
