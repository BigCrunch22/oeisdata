%N A317162 Sinuosity of the 26 letters of the alphabet, lettertype Calibri, multiplied by thousand and rounded.
%C A317162 It appears that the average sinuosity of the letters in the alphabet is 3.14 (Pi), like the supposed average sinuosity of the rivers in the world.

%F A317162 Sinuosity = L / l, where L is the length of the lines that make up the letter, l is the length of the straight line from the beginning to the end of the letter.
%e A317162 In Calibri the letter 'A' is in a rectangle 1 by 0.75, so l = 0.75. The letter A consists of two sloping lines which length is two times square root of (1^2 + 0.375^2) plus a line length 0.5, so L = 2,636. Therefore the sinuosity of A is 3.515 (2.636 divided by 0.75).
