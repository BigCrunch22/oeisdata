%F A317367 Note that mex is the minimum excluded function and (+) is bitwise exclusive or. This is an obvious construction given the symmetry of the graph. We define a three-connected path graph P_{n}(3) as the path graph P_{n} with vertices labeled sequentially from 1 to n and additional edges E'={{i, j} : |i-j|=3}. The Sprague-Grundy value of P_{n}(3) is given by the function a(n).
%F A317367 The B-Variant of length n of P_{n}(3) (denoted P_{n}^{B}(3)) is exactly P_{n}(3) with one additional vertex -1 and one additional edge {-1,2}. The degree of vertex -1 is one. The Sprague-Grundy value of P_{n}^{B}(3) is given by the function b(n).
%F A317367 The C-Variant of length n of P_{n}(3) (denoted P_{n}^{C}(3)) is exactly P_{n}(3) with two additional vertices -1 and n+2 and additional edges {-1,2} and {n-1,n+2}. The degree of vertices -1 and n+2 is one. The Sprague-Grundy value of P_{n}^{C}(3) is given by the function c(n).
