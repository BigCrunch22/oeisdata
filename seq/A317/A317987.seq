%N A317987 Discriminants of orders of imaginary quadratic fields with 2 classes per genus, negated.
%C A317987 k is a term iff the form class group of positive binary quadratic forms with discriminant -k is isomorphic to (C_2)^r X C_4.
%C A317987 This is a subsequence of A133676, so it's finite. It seems that this sequence has 324 terms, the largest being 87360.
%C A317987 The smallest number in A133676 but not here is 3600.
