%N A317990 Number of genera of real quadratic field Q(sqrt(k)), k squarefree > 1.
%C A317990 The number of genera of a quadratic field is equal to the number of elements x in the class group such that x^2 = e where e is the identity.
%C A317990 This is the analog of A003643 for real quadratic fields. Note that for this case "the class group" refers to the narrow class group, or the form class group of indefinite binary forms with discriminant k.
