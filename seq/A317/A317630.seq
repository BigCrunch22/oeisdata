%N A317630 Lexicographically first sequence of different terms, starting with a(1) = 0 and showing a 1-step roller coaster of terms together with a 1-step roller coaster of digits (see the Comments section).
%C A317630 Every term a(n) > 0 of the sequence stands between two terms bigger than a(n) or between two terms smaller than a(n); this is also true for every digit d > 0 of the sequence that stands between two digits bigger than d or between two digits smaller than d.

%e A317630 The sequence starts with 0,2,1,4,3,6,5,8,7,80,9,13,12,15,14,17,16,19...
%e A317630 If we consider the terms, we see indeed that 0 < 2 > 1 < 4 > 3 < 6 > 5 < 8 > 7 < 80 > 9 < 13 > 12 < 15 > 14 < 17 > 16 < 19... and if we consider the digits, we see also that 0 < 2 > 1 < 4 > 3 < 6 > 5 < 8 > 7 < 8 > 0 < 9 > 1 < 3 > 1 < 2 > 1 < 5 > 1 < 4 > 1 < 7 > 1 < 6 > 1 < 9...
%e A317630 So no matter the elements considered (terms, digits), those elements seem to ride on a 1-step roller-coaster: up, down, up, down, up, etc.
%Y A317630 Cf. A014681 (a 1-step roller coaster of terms only) and A317548 (a 1-step roller coaster of digits only).
