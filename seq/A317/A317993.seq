%N A317993 Number of k such that (Z/kZ)* is isomorphic to (Z/nZ)*, where (Z/nZ)* is the multiplicative group of integers modulo n.
%C A317993 To find solutions for k to (Z/kZ)* = (Z/nZ)*, it's sufficient to check for A015126(n) <= k <= A028476(n).
%C A317993 It seems that this sequence is unbounded. For example, there are 59 solutions to (Z/nZ)* = C_2 X C_6 X C_1260.
%C A317993 Conjecture: Every number occurs in this sequence.

%e A317993 The solutions to (Z/kZ)* = C_6 are k = 7, 9, 14 and 18, so a(7) = a(9) = a(14) = a(18) = 4.
%e A317993 The solutions to (Z/kZ)* = C_2 X C_20 are k = 55, 75, 100, 110 and 150, so a(55) = a(75) = a(100) = a(110) = a(150) = 5.
%e A317993 The solutions to (Z/kZ)* = C_2 X C_12 are k = 35, 39, 45, 52, 70, 78 and 90, so a(35) = a(39) = a(45) = a(52) = a(70) = a(78) = a(90) = 7.
