%N A317986 Odd numbers k > 1 such that k == 1 (mod 4), Product_{n>=1} (a(n)-1)/(a(n)+1) = Pi/4, and Limit_{n->oo} a(n+1)/a(n) = 3, where a(1) = 13 (see comments).
%C A317986 For odd numbers {5,7,9,11,13,.,k,..} we define the product (k-1)/(k+1) if k == 1 (mod 4), otherwise (k+1)/(k-1). Then (2/3)*(4/3)*(4/5)*(6/5)*(6/7)*(8/7)*... = Pi/4 = 0.78539816339744... < 1, based on the Wallis product. This sequence answers the question, what terms must be deleted such that the product of remaining terms equals 1?.
%C A317986 Since Pi/4 < 1 the terms that must be deleted to make the product equal 1 are all 1 (mod 4). These are the least possible, and apparently their product is Pi/4. The remaining sequence which has product 1 contains more terms that are 3 (mod 4) than 1 (mod 4).
