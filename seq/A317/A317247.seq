%N A317247 Let E(n,k) denote the k-th smallest Carmichael number such that there are n distinct Carmichael numbers: {x(1), x(2), ..., x(n)} where x_i < E_(n,k), such that for any integer i: 1 <= i <= n, x(i) is a quadratic residue of E(n,k).
%C A317247 This may be a (inconsistent) way of picking the n-th occurrence of n in A359729. But apparently there is no 5th occurrence of 5, no 10th occurrence of 10 in A359729: 6601, 62745, 115921, 8719309, ?, 1615681, 1857241, 5444489, 10606681, ?, ... - _R. J. Mathar_, Jan 12 2023

%E A317247 This entry was created 6 months ago, but apparently the author forgot to click the "Submit" button. The definition is not clear to me, so I'm marking it as "uned" and approving it in the hope that someone can say exactly what the definition is. An example or two would be helpful. - _N. J. A.
