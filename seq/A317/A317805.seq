%N A317805 Lexicographically earliest sequence of nonnegative terms such that for any n > 0 and k > 0, a(n) AND a(n + k) <> a(n + 2*k) (where AND denotes the bitwise AND operator).
%C A317805 This sequence has similarities with A276204: here we consider the bitwise AND operator, there the addition operator.
%C A317805 Apparently, the variant where we use the bitwise OR operator corresponds, up to a change of offset, to A289814.
%C A317805 The scatterplot of the sequence has fractal features (see illustrations in Links section).
