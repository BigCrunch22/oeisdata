%N A317586 Number of circular binary words of length n having the maximum possible number of distinct blocks of length floor(log_2 n) and floor(log_2 n)+1.
%C A317586 A circular binary word (a.k.a. "necklace") can be viewed as a representative of the equivalence class under cyclic shift.
%C A317586 The words counted by this sequence have 2^i distinct blocks of length i = floor(log_2 n) and n distinct blocks of length i+1.
%C A317586 This sequence counts a certain natural generalization of de Bruijn words, which are cyclic words of length 2^n containing all n-bit blocks as subwords.

%e A317586 For n = 6 the 3 possibilities are {000111, 001011, 001101}.  Each contains all 4 blocks of length 2, and 6 distinct blocks of length 3 (when considered circularly).
%Y A317586 Cf. A016031, which gives the value of this sequence evaluated at powers of 2.
