%N A317573 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of n X n tic-tac-toe positions (up to rotation and reflection) with k tokens (i.e., after k plays) which allow a winning strategy for X (n > 0, 0 <= k <= n^2).
%C A317573 Only positions occurring in a game are counted. This excludes, for instance, those with two complete lines.
%C A317573 Positions where X has already won are included.
%C A317573 The number of positions headed for a draw (provided that both players play their best moves from there on) is A317575(n,k) - T(n,k) - A317574(n,k).
