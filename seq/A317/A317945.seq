%N A317945 Filter sequence constructed from the coefficients of the Stern polynomials B(d,t) collected for each divisor d of n. Restricted growth sequence transform of A317944.
%C A317945 Differs from A000027(n) = n (positive integers) from a(193) = 191 on.
%C A317945 For all i, j: a(i) = a(j) => A317838(i) = A317838(j).
%C A317945 There are certain prime pairs p, q for which the Stern polynomials B(p,t) and B(q,t) (see table A125184) have equal multisets of nonzero coefficients. For example, for primes 191 and 193 these coefficients are {1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1} and {1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1} (from which follows that A278243(191) = A278243(193), A286378(191) = A286378(193) and thus => a(191) = a(193) => A002487(191) = A002487(193) as well). Other such prime pairs currently known are {419, 461}, {2083, 2143} and {11777, 12799}. Whenever a(p) = a(q) for such a prime pair, then also a(2^k * p) = a(2^k * q) for all k >= 0. It would be nice to know whether there could exist any other cases of a(i) = a(j), i != j, but for example both i and j being odd semiprimes?
