%N A317534 Numbers k such that the poset of factorizations of k, ordered by refinement, is not a lattice.
%C A317534 Includes 2^k for all k > 4.
%C A317534 Conjecture: Let S be the set of all numbers whose prime signature is either {1,3}, {5}, or {1,1,2}. Then the sequence consists of all multiples of elements of S. - _David A. Corneth_, Jul 31 2018.

%e A317534 In the poset of factorizations of 24, the factorizations (2*2*6) and (2*3*4) have two least-upper bounds, namely (2*12) and (4*6), so this poset is not a lattice.
