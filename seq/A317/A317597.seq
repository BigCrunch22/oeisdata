%N A317597 a(n) is the smallest even number for which there are n prime numbers between a(n) and the largest prime number p such that a(n)-p is also a prime.
%e A317597 For n=0, 10 = 7 + 3 is the smallest even number such that there is no prime between 7 and 10, so a(0)=10;
%e A317597 for n=1, 4 = 2 + 2 is the smallest even number such that there is only one prime between 2 and 4, which is 3, so a(1)=4;
%e A317597 for n=2, 128 = 109 + 19, there are two primes between 109 and 128, which are 113 and 127, for which a(n)-p = 15 and 1 respectively, and both nonprime.  There is no smaller even number having exactly 2 such primes, so a(2)=128.
