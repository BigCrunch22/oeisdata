%N A317554 Sum of coefficients in the expansion of p(y) in terms of Schur functions, where p is power-sum symmetric functions and y is the integer partition with Heinz number n.
%C A317554 a(1) = 1 by convention.
%C A317554 Is this sequence is nonnegative? If so, is there a combinatorial interpretation?
%e A317554 We have p(33) = s(6) + 2 s(33) - s(51) + 2 s(222) - 2 s(321) + s(411) + s(3111) - s(21111) + s(111111). The coefficients add up to 4, and the Heinz number of (33) is 25, so a(25) = 4.
