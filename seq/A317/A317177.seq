%N A317177 Number of distinct circular critical exponents possible, over all binary strings of length n.
%C A317177 A string x has period p if x[i]=x[i+p] for all i that make sense. The shortest period is called "the" period. The exponent exp(x) of a string x of length n is defined to be n/p, where p is the period. Two words are conjugates if one is a cyclic shift of the other. The circular critical exponent is the maximum, over all contiguous subwords w of all conjugates of x, of exp(w).
%e A317177 For n = 7, the a(7) = 7 circular critical exponents possible are 7 (from 0000000); 6 (from 0000001); 5 (from 0000011); 4 (from 0000101); 3 (from 0001001); 7/3 (from 1001001); and 7/2 (from 0101010).
%Y A317177 Cf. A317167.
