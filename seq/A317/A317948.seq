%N A317948 An example of a morphic word: the sorted (by length, then alphabetically) sequence of words of the form a*b* under the action of a finite automaton defined as follows: start state is 0; a and b map states [0, 1, 2, 3] to states [1, 2, 3, 0] and [0, 3, 1, 2], respectively.
%C A317948 The Duchêne et al. (2011) reference mentions many other sequences that are of great interest.
%C A317948 From _Kevin Ryde_, Dec 26 2020: (Start)
%C A317948 This sequence can be taken as a square array S(m,k) read by upwards antidiagonals with rows m >= 0 and columns k >= 0.  S(m,k) is the final state for input word a^m b^k where ^ denotes repetition.  Input a's cycle around states 0,1,2,3 so S(m,0) = m mod 4.  Within an array row, input b's are no change at state 0 (so a row of 0's), or a repeating cycle 3,2,1 starting at m mod 4.
%C A317948 Antidiagonal d of the array is input words of length d = m+k, so terms S(d-k,k).  These are words a^(d-k) b^k and the combination of d-k mod 4 and k mod 3 is 12-periodic within a diagonal.  The sequence can also be taken as a triangle read by rows T(d,k) = S(d-k,k) for d >= 0 and 0 <= k <= d.
%C A317948 Rigo (2000, section 2.1 remark 2) notes that the sequence (flat sequence) is not periodic because pairs of terms 0,0 are at ever-increasing distances apart.  They are a(n)=a(n+1)=0 iff n = 2*t*(4*t+1) = A033585(t) for t >= 1, which is every fourth triangular number.
