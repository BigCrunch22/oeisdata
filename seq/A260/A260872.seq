%N A260872 Squarefree numbers k such that k+1 has no primes of the form 4*m-1 and at most one 2 in its prime factorization.
%C A260872 An even number k is congruent to either 0 or 2 mod 4. If congruent to 0, it is divisible by 4 and thus not squarefree. If k is congruent to 2, k+1 will be one less than a multiple of 4, and thus at least one prime factor of k+1 will be one less than a multiple of 4. Thus, there are no even numbers in this sequence.
%C A260872 From the author's comment above, all sequence terms must be odd, so k+1 must always be even and k+1 will always be singly even. - _Ray Chandler_, Aug 03 2015

%e A260872 41 + 1 = 42 = 2*3*7 and both 3 and 7 are prime numbers of the form 4*n-1, so 41 is not a term of this sequence.
