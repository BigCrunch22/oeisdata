%N A260305 We represent square arrays of single-digit entries by the single number formed by reading them row-by-row, top-to-bottom. Sequence gives list of k X k square grids formed from single-digit numbers having property that reading across each row and each column gives a square number.
%C A260305 Suppose for example a term has 9 digits, say abcdefghi. This means that the grid is
%C A260305 abc
%C A260305 def
%C A260305 ghi
%C A260305 and that the decimal concatenations abc, def, ghi, adg, beh, cfi are all squares. E.g., for 121256169 we see that 121, 256, 169, 121, 256 and 169 are squares.
%C A260305 There are 3 grids of size 1 X 1.
%C A260305 There are 4 grids of size 2 X 2.
%C A260305 There are 13 grids of size 3 X 3.
%C A260305 There are 14 grids of size 4 X 4.
%C A260305 There are 76 grids of size 5 X 5.
%C A260305 There are 108 grids of size 6 X 6.
%C A260305 There are 459 grids of size 7 X 7.
%C A260305 There are 844 grids of size 8 X 8.
%C A260305 No leading zeros are allowed in the rows and columns.
