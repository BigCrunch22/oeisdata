%N A260968 Number of all-small normal play partisan games born on or before day n.
%C A260968 A game is all-small if it and all its followers other than 0 have options for both players, or equivalently (under normal play rules) if it and all its followers are infinitesimal. "All-small" is the traditional term, although Aaron Siegel prefers "dicotic", attributed to Michael Weimerskirch.
%C A260968 The all-small games born by day n form a distributive lattice if additional minimal and maximal elements are added.
%C A260968 The values up to a(4) are due to Aaron Siegel, computed using cgsuite.
