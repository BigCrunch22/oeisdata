%N A260444 Infinite palindromic word (a(1),a(2),a(3),...) with initial word w(1) = (1,0,0) and midword sequence (a(n)); see A260390.
%C A260444 Below, w* denotes the reversal of a word w, and "sequence" and "word" are interchangeable. An infinite word is palindromic if it has infinitely many initial subwords w such that w = w*.
%C A260444 Many infinite palindromic words (a(1),a(2),...) are determined by an initial word w and a midword sequence (m(1),m(2),...) of palindromes, as follows: for given w of length k, take w(1) = w = (a(1),a(2),...,a(k)). Form the palindrome w(2) = w(1)m(1)w(1)* by concatenating w(1), m(1), and w(1)*. Continue inductively; i.e., w(n+1) = w(n)m(n)w(n)* for all n >= 1. See A260390 for a guide to related sequences.
%e A260444 w(1) = 100, the initial word.
%e A260444 w(2) = 1001001 ( = 100+1+001, where + = concatenation)
%e A260444 w(3) = w(2)+0+w(2)*
%e A260444 w(4) = w(3)+1+w(3)*
