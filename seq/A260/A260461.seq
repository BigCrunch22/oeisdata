%N A260461 Numbers k in A096091 such that the nonzero digits of k are not all the same and k/10 is not in the sequence.
%C A260461 A096091 contains infinitely many of each of two types of terms (which are not disjoint): (1) terms whose nonzero digits are all the same, and (2) terms that are 10 times another term in A096091. This sequence lists the terms that remain after removal of all terms that match one or both of those two criteria. See comments in A096091.
