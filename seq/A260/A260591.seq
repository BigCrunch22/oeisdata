%N A260591 a(n) is the number of odd numbers k < 2^n such that A260590(k) = n.
%C A260591 a(n) is either 0 or about c^(n-1) with c = log(3)/log(2).
%C A260591 Out of the first thirty terms, 12, or 40% are zeros.
%C A260591 Nonzero values give A100982. - _Ruud H.G. van Tol_, Nov 25 2021
%C A260591 A close variant of this sequence, that starts at offset 0, but with a(0)=0 and a(1)=1, maps it to the count of dropping patterns of 2^n+c(2^n), with the c(2^n) as mentioned with A177789. The positions of the zeros of that variant sequence might be a close variant of A054414, again with a(0)=0 (not properly checked yet). - _Ruud H.G. van Tol_, Nov 28 2021
%e A260591 a(1) = 0 since there exists no odd number whose msa is 1;
%e A260591 a(2) = 1 since there is only one odd number, 5 with k=2 2k+1, with k less than 2^2 whose msa is 2;
%e A260591 a(3) = 0 since there exists no odd number whose msa is 3;
%e A260591 a(4) = 1 since there is only one number, 1, less than 2^(4+1) whose msa is 4;
%e A260591 a(5) = 2 since there are two numbers, 11 & 23, less than 2^(4+1) whose msa is 4; etc.
