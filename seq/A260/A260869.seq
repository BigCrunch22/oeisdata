%N A260869 Least k > 0 such that k^2 + (prime(n)-k)^2 is a prime, or 0 if no such k exists.
%C A260869 It appears that any prime (and also any odd number > 1, see A260870) can be written as the sum of two positive integers such that the sum of their squares is prime. For an even number > 2 this is obviously not possible since k and 2n-k have the same parity and therefore the sum of their squares is even.
