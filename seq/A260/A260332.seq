%N A260332 Labelings of n diamond-shaped posets with 4 vertices per diamond where the labels follow the poset relations whose associated reading permutation avoids 231 in the classical sense.
%C A260332 According to Yang-Jiang (2021) these are the 5-Schroeder numbers. If confirmed, this will prove Michael Weiner's conjectures and enable us to extend the sequence. Yang & Jiang (2021) give an explicit formula for the m-Schroeder numbers in Theorem 2.4. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 28 2021
%C A260332 By diamond-shaped poset with 4 vertices, we mean a poset on four elements with e_1 < e_2, e_1 < e_3, e_2 < e_4, e_3 < e_4, and no order relations between e_2 and e_3. In the Hasse diagram for such a poset, we have a least element, two elements in the level above, and one element in the top level, so the diagram resembles a diamond.  The associated permutation is the permutation obtained by reading the labels of each poset by levels left to right, starting with the least element.
%C A260332 Also the number of labelings of n diamond-shaped posets with 4 vertices per diamond where the labels follow the poset relations whose associated reading permutation avoids 312 in the classical sense via reverse complement Wilf equivalence.
%C A260332 Conjecture: Also the number of lattice paths (Schroeder paths) from (0,0) to (n,4n) with unit steps N=(0,1), E=(1,0) and D=(1,1) staying weakly above the line y = 4x. - _Michael D. Weiner_, Jul 24 2019

%e A260332 For a single diamond (n=1) poset with 4 vertices, we must label the least element 1 and the greatest element 4, and the two central elements can be labeled either 2, 3 or 3, 2 respectively. Thus the associated permutations are 1234 and 1324.
