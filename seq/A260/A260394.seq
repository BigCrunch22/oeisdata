%N A260394 Infinite palindromic word (a(1),a(2),a(3),...) with initial word w(1) = (0,1,1) and midword sequence (a(n)); see Comments.
%C A260394 Below, w* denotes the reversal of a word w, and "sequence" and "word" are interchangable. An infinite word is palindromic if it has infinitely many initial subwords w such that w = w*.
%C A260394 Many infinite palindromic words (a(1),a(2),...) are determined by an initial word w and a midword sequence (m(1),m(2),...) of palindromes, as follows: for given w of length k, take w(1) = w = (a(1),a(2),...,a(k)). Form the palindrome w(2) = w(1)m(1)w(1)* by concatenating w(1), m(1), and w(1)*. Continue inductively; i.e., w(n+1) = w(n)m(n)w(n)* for all n >= 1. See A260390 for examples.
