%N A260549 Primitive values n such that the square with opposite corners (0,0) and (n,n) contains a point (x,y) with integer coordinates, with 0 < x,y < n, at an integer distance from three of the four corners.
%C A260549 Primitiveness condition prescribes that, if n is in the sequence because of the interior point (x, y), then GCD(x, y, n) = 1.
%C A260549 Some values admit more than one qualifying interior point. For example, for n = 21125 we have both (4416, 3737) and (8357, 7524).
%C A260549 This sequence is a superset of A215365, which only contains even values.

%e A260549 700 is in the sequence because the point (304,297) is at distance 425 from (0,0), 495 from (700,0) and 565 from (700,700) and GCD(700,304,297) = 1.
