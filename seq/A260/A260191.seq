%N A260191 Numbers m such that there exists no square whose base-m digit sum is binomial(m,2).
%C A260191 After the initial term a(1)=3 (see Example), this sequence consists of all numbers of the form (2j-1)*4^k+1 where j and k are positive integers.
%C A260191 For each term m > 3, no square has a base-m digit sum == binomial(m,2) (mod 4).
%C A260191 After the initial term a(1)=3, is this A249034?
%e A260191 No square has a base-3 digit sum of exactly binomial(3,2)=3, so 3 is in the sequence.
%e A260191 Binomial(5,2) = 10 == 2 (mod 4), but no square has a base-5 digit sum == 2 (mod 4), so there cannot be a square whose base-5 digit sum is 10; thus, 5 is in the sequence.
