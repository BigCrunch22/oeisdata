%N A260159 Number of minimal overlapping permutations starting with 2 of length n.
%C A260159 A permutation is minimal overlapping if the shortest permutation containing two consecutive occurrences of it has length 2n-1. It is also called non-overlapping. A263867(n) is the number of minimal overlapping permutations of length n.
%C A260159 a(n) is asymptotically less than A260156(n) which is the number of minimal overlapping permutations starting with 1 of length n.
%H A260159 Ran Pan, Jeffrey B. Remmel, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08190">Minimal overlapping patterns for generalized Euler permutations, standard tableaux of rectangular shape, and column strict arrays</a>, arXiv:1510.08190 [math.CO], 2015.
%F A260159 The limit of a(n)/(n-1)! is approximately 0.384 (R. Pan and J. Remmel).
%e A260159 There are 3 minimal overlapping permutations starting with 2 of length 4: 2341, 2431, 2134.
%Y A260159 Cf. A260156, A263867.
