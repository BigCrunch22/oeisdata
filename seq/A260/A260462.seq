%N A260462 Numbers k such that the digits of k are in increasing order and k divides (reverse(k) * 10^m) for some sufficiently-large integer m.
%C A260462 This sequence consists of the set of distinct numbers that result from taking the terms of A260461, sorting the digits of each term in ascending order, and discarding the leading zeros.
%C A260462 (Equivalently, this sequence consists of the set of distinct numbers that result from taking the terms of A096091 whose nonzero digits are not all the same, sorting the digits of each term in ascending order, and discarding the leading zeros.)
%C A260462 Through a(21) = 111888, the digits 7 and 9 do not appear.
%C A260462 After a(21) = 111888, there are no more terms through 10^27. Presumably, the sequence is full. Is there a proof?
%Y A260462 Cf. A096091, A260461.
