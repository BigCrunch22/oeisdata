%N A260511 Number of signed permutations of length n that are sortable to the identity permutation by some sequence of cdr (context-directed reversal) moves.

%e A260511 a(2) = 3 because [1,2], [-1,2], and [1,-2] are sortable to the identity [1,2] using only context-directed reversal moves.
%Y A260511 A249165 gives the number of unsigned permutations sortable by context-directed swaps; this is the analog for signed permutations and context-directed reversals.
%Y A260511 A260506 gives the number of signed permutations sortable by both cdr and cds moves together. This sequence is therefore always bounded by A260506.
%Y A260511 A000165 counts the total number of signed permutations.
