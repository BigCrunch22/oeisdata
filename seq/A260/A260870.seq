%N A260870 Least k>0 such that k^2 + (2n+1-k)^2 is prime, or 0 if no such k exists.
%C A260870 It appears that any odd number N = 2n+1 > 1 (and also N = 2, hence all primes, see A260869) can be written as the sum of two positive integers such that the sum of their squares is prime. For an even number > 2 this is obviously not possible since k and 2n-k have the same parity and therefore the sum of their squares is even.
