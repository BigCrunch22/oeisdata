%N A260929 Least positive integer k < prime(n) such that k + k' is a triangular number, where k' is the unique integer among 1,...,prime(n)-1 with k*k' == 1 (mod prime(n)), or 0 if no such k exists.
%C A260929 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 7. In other words, for any prime p > 17 there are two integers k and k' among 1,...,p-1 with k*k' == 1 (mod p) such that k + k' is a triangular number.
%C A260929 See also A260928 for a similar conjecture involving squares.

%e A260929  a(5) = 7 since 7*8 is congruent to 1 modulo prime(5)=11, and 7 + 8 = 5*6/2 is a triangular number.
%e A260929 a(8) = 18 since 18*18 is congruent to 1 modulo prime(8)=19, and 18 + 18 = 8*9/2 is a triangular number.
