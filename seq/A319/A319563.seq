%N A319563 Let f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1 + i (where i denotes the imaginary unit), and for n > 1, f(n+1) is the Gaussian integer in the first quadrant (with positive real part and nonnegative imaginary part) with least modulus and sharing a prime factor with f(n) (in case of a tie, minimize the imaginary part); a(n) = the imaginary part of f(n).
%C A319563 See A319561 for the square of the modulus of f and additional comments.
