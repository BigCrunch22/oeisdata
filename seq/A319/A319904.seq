%N A319904 Calculated atomic radii (in picometers) of the chemical elements.
%C A319904 For chemical elements there are empirically measured atomic radii, calculated atomic radii, van der Waals radii and covalent radii to measure the "size" of their atoms. This sequence lists the calculated atomic radii.
%C A319904 The values for chemical elements in each period (1 - 2, 3 - 10, 11 - 18, 19 - 36, 37 - 54, 55 - 86) are decreasing except for those of some lanthanide elements.
%H A319904 Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_radius#Calculated_atomic_radii">Calculated atomic radii</a>.
%e A319904 The calculated atomic radii for hydrogen (1), helium (2) and lithium (3), etc. are 53 pm, 32 pm, 167 pm, etc.
%Y A319904 Cf. A081100, A081101 (but remember they are not based on this sequence).
%Y A319904 Cf. A319914 (covalent radius).
