%N A319432 The first differences (A129761) of the tribonacci representation numbers (A003714 or A014417) consists of runs of 1's separated by the terms of the present sequence.
%C A319432 The runs of 1's in A129761 have lengths that apparently are given by the Fibonacci word A005614 (with a slight change at the start). The present sequence shows the terms greater than 1.  The structure of this sequence is (partially) analyzed in the comments in A129761.
