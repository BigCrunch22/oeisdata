%N A319154 a(n) is the smallest nonnegative integer not yet in the sequence that starts with the ending digit of a(n-1); a(1)=0; initial zeros are dropped.
%C A319154 Theorem: Every nonnegative number appears.
%C A319154 Proof: (Sketched by _Enrique Navarrete_, Sep 25 2018; completed by _N. J. A. Sloane_, Oct 27 2018)
%C A319154 (i) Sequence is infinite (dG, G=giant number, is always available)
%C A319154 (ii) As usual for these "lexicographically earliest distinct term sequences", for any k, there is a threshold n_k such that for all n > n_k, a(n) > k.
%C A319154 (iii) Some final digit (d, say) appears infinitely often. (Otherwise sequence would be finite.) If d=0, go to step (vi).
%C A319154 (iv) All numbers beginning with d appear (If dm were missing, find xd in sequence which is > dm and also > n_{dm}. Then term after xd would be dm, contradiction.)
%C A319154 (v) In particular, all numbers dm0 appear.
%C A319154 (vi) After a number ending in 0, the next number is the smallest missing number. So if x is missing, find dm0 > n_x, then the next term would be (0)x = x, a contradiction. QED

%e A319154 a(2) = 1 since it is formed from a(1) = 0 as 01 = 1.
%e A319154 a(20) = 11 since it is the smallest number not yet in the sequence that starts with the ending digit 0 of a(19) = 90.
