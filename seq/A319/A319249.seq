%N A319249 Greater of the pairs of twin primes in A001122.
%C A319249 Primes p such that both p - 2 and p are both in A001122.
%C A319249 Apart from the first term, all terms are congruent to 13 mod 24, since terms in A006512 are congruent to 1 mod 6 apart from the first one, and terms in A001122 are congruent to 3 or 5 mod 8.
%C A319249 Note that "there are infinitely many pairs of twin primes" and "there are infinitely many primes with primitive root 2" are two famous and unsolved problems, so a stronger conjecture implying both of them is that this sequence is infinite.
%C A319249 Also note that a pair of cousin primes can't both appear in A001122, while a pair of sexy primes can.

%e A319249 11 and 13 is a pair of twin primes both having 2 as a primitive root, so 13 is a term.
%e A319249 59 and 61 is a pair of twin primes both having 2 as a primitive root, so 61 is a term.
%e A319249 Although 137 and 139 is a pair of twin primes, 139 has 2 as a primitive root while 137 doesn't, so 139 is not a term.
