%N A319783 Number of set systems spanning n vertices with empty intersection whose dual is also a set system with empty intersection.
%C A319783 The dual of a multiset partition has, for each vertex, one part consisting of the indices (or positions) of the parts containing that vertex, counted with multiplicity. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,2}} is {{1},{1,2,2}}.
%e A319783 The a(3) = 1 set system is {{1,2},{1,3},{2,3}}.
