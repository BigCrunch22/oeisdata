%N A319043 Composite numbers k such that Pell(k) == -1 (mod k).
%C A319043 It appears that most of the terms of A319041 (Numbers k such that Pell(k) == -1 (mod k)) are primes; this sequence lists the composites.
%C A319043 For the composite numbers k such that Pell(k) == 1 (mod k), see A319042.
%C A319043 Numbers that are terms of this sequence seem to be considerably less common than those in A319042; e.g., the numbers of terms in that sequence up to 10^3, 10^4, 10^5, and 10^6 are 5, 21, 67, and 200, respectively, while the corresponding term counts here are only 1, 2, 9, and 31. Why is this?

%e A319043 k=741 is in the sequence: Pell(741) = 741*M - 1 == -1 (mod 741) (where M is a large integer).
%e A319043 k=6 is not in the sequence: Pell(6) = 70 = 6*12 - 2 !== -1 (mod 6).
