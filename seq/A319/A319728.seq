%N A319728 Number of strict T_0 integer partitions of n.
%C A319728 The dual of a multiset partition has, for each vertex, one block consisting of the indices (or positions) of the blocks containing that vertex, counted with multiplicity. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,2}} is {{1},{1,2,2}}. For an integer partition the T_0 condition means the dual of the multiset partition obtained by factoring each part into prime numbers is strict (no repeated blocks).
%e A319728 The a(11) = 10 integer partitions are (11), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (5,4,2), (6,3,2), (6,4,1), (7,3,1), (8,2,1), (5,3,2,1). Missing from this list are (6,5) and (10,1).
