%N A319489 Number of non-isomorphic connected graphs on n vertices with representation number 2.
%C A319489 These are graphs that can be represented by words having two copies of each letter, but cannot be represented by words having one copy of each letter. In a word representing a graph G, letters x and y alternate if and only if there is an edge between x and y in G. Such graphs, along with complete graphs, are precisely the class of circle graphs.
