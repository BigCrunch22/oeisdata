%N A319813 a(n) is the smallest a such that n is divisible by a^n + 1, or 0 if no such a exists.
%C A319813 a(n) = 0 iff n is even and -1 is not a square modulo n, that is, n is even and not in A008784. For other n > 2, 2 <= a(n) <= n - 1.
%C A319813 a(p) = p - 1 for primes p. For composite n, a(n) = n - 1 iff gcd(n, phi(n)) = 1, that is, n is in A050384.
%C A319813 a(A006521(n)) = 2.

%F A319813 For n = 9, 9 is divisible by a^9 + 1 implies a == 2 (mod 3), so a(9) = 2.
%F A319813 For n = 10, 10 is divisible by a^10 + 1 implies a == 3, 7 (mod 10), so a(10) = 3.
%F A319813 For n = 34, 34 is divisible by a^34 + 1 implies a == 13, 21 (mod 34), so a(34) = 13.
