%N A319160 Number of integer partitions of n whose multiplicities appear with relatively prime multiplicities.
%C A319160 From _Gus Wiseman_, Jul 11 2023: (Start)
%C A319160 A partition is aperiodic (A000837) if its multiplicities are relatively prime. This sequence counts partitions whose multiplicities are aperiodic.
%C A319160 For example:
%C A319160 - The multiplicities of (5,3) are (1,1), with multiplicities (2), with common divisor 2, so it is not counted under a(8).
%C A319160 - The multiplicities of (3,2,2,1) are (2,1,1), with multiplicities (2,1), which are relatively prime, so it is counted under a(8).
%C A319160 - The multiplicities of (3,3,1,1) are (2,2), with multiplicities (2), with common divisor 2, so it is not counted under a(8).
%C A319160 - The multiplicities of (4,4,4,3,3,3,2,1) are (3,3,1,1), with multiplicities (2,2), which have common divisor 2, so it is not counted under a(24).

%Y A319160 These partitions have ranks A319161.
%Y A319160 For distinct instead of relatively prime multiplicities we have A325329.
