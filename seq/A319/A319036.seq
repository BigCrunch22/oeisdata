%N A319036 a(n) is the smallest triangular number T(k) such that both it and its successor T(k+1) have exactly 2n divisors, or 0 if no such pair of consecutive triangular numbers exists.
%C A319036 The only primes p for which a(p) > 0 are those for which both 2*3^(p-1) - 1 and 2*3^(p-1) + 1 are prime: 2, 3, and any other primes p such that p-1 appears both in A003307 and A003306. (If such a prime p > 3 exists, then p exceeds 1360105.)
%C A319036 Conjecture: The only primes p for which a(p) > 0 are 2 and 3.
%e A319036 For n=1, the only triangular number with exactly 2*1 = 2 divisors is T(2) = 2*(2+1)/2 = 3 (the only triangular number that is prime); thus, exists no pair of consecutive triangular numbers having exactly 2 divisors, so a(1)=0.
%e A319036 a(2) is 6 because T(3) = 3*(3+1)/2 = 6 and T(4) = 4*(4+1)/2 = 10 are the first two consecutive triangular numbers having exactly 2*2 = 4 divisors.
