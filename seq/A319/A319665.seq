%N A319665 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = log_5(4*k + 1) mod 2^n, n >= 2, 0 <= k <= 2^(n-2) - 1.
%C A319665 The n-th row contains 2^(n-2) numbers. T(n,k) is the smallest e such that 5^e == 4*k + 1 (mod 2^n). This equation always has a solution in [0, 2^(n-2) - 1], so the n-th row is a permutation of 0, 1, 2, ..., 2^(n-2) - 1.
%C A319665 For e >= 4, the multiplicative order of a modulo 2^e equals to 2^(e-2) iff a == 3, 5 (mod 8); for e >= 5, the multiplicative order of a modulo 2^e equals to 2^(e-3) iff a == 7, 9 (mod 16); for e >= 6, the multiplicative order of a modulo 2^e equals to 2^(e-4) iff a == 15, 17 (mod 32), etc. From this we can see v(T(n,k), 2) = v(k, 2), where v(k, 2) = A007814(k) is the 2-adic valuation of k. Also, 4*k + 1 is a 2^v(k, 2)-th power residue but not a 2^(v(k, 2)+1)-th power residue modulo 2^i, i >= v(k, 2) + 3.
%C A319665 Define Chi(n,k) as: Chi(n,2*k) = 0 for all integers k, Chi(n,4*k+1) = exp(T(n,k)*Pi*i/2^(n-3)) for 0 <= k <= 2^(n-2) - 1 (i denotes the imaginary unit), Chi(n,4*k+3) = Chi(n,2^n-4*k-3) for 0 <= k <= 2^(n-2) - 1, Chi(n,2^n+k) = Chi(n,k) for all integers k, then Chi(n,k) forms a Dirichlet character modulo 2^n.
