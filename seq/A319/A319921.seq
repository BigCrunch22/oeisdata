%N A319921 Underline the central digit of all terms: the underlined digits reconstruct the starting sequence. This is also true if one translates the sequence in French and underlines the central letter of each word: the underlined letters spell the (French) sequence again. This is the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct terms.
%C A319921 By construction, all integers have here an odd number of digits and an odd number of letters in their French translation.

%e A319921 The sequence starts with 331, 233, 10177, 224, 10314, and the central (underlined) digits are 3,3,1,2,3,... which are precisely the digits starting the sequence itself; now the successive 5 unique central letters of the above 5 French terms are T, R, O, I, S and this spells the beginning of TROIS CENT TRENTE ET UN, the term a(1).
%e A319921 The first term diverging from A319718 is a(21) = [TROISC(E)NTDEUX, 302] as a(21) is the smallest integer > a(16) = [DEUXC(E)NTSIX, 206], both having a central (underlined) letter E.
