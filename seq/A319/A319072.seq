%N A319072 a(n) is the sum of the non-bi-unitary divisors of n.
%F A319072 a(n) = A000203(n) - A188999(n).
%e A319072 For n = 12 the divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, and the bi-unitary divisors of 12 are 1, 3, 4, 12, hence the non-bi-unitary divisors of 12 are 2 and 6, and the sum of them is 2 + 6 = 8, so a(12) = 8. Also the sum of the divisors of 12 is 28, and the sum of the bi-unitary divisors of 12 is 20, so a(12) = 28 - 20 = 8.
