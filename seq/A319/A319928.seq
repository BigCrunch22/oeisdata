%N A319928 Numbers k such that there is no other m such that (Z/mZ)* is isomorphic to (Z/kZ)*, where (Z/kZ)* is the multiplicative group of integers modulo k.
%C A319928 Numbers such that A317993(k) = 1.
%C A319928 To find such k, it's sufficient to check for A015126(k) <= m <= A028476(k).
%C A319928 This is a subsequence of A296233. As a result, all members in this sequence should not satisfy any congruence mentioned there. Specially, all terms here are divisible by 4.
%C A319928 There are only 218 terms <= 10000 and 396 terms <= 20000.

%e A319928 (Z/24Z)* = C_2 X C_2 X C_2, and there is no other m such that (Z/mZ)* = C_2 X C_2 X C_2, so 24 is a term.
%e A319928 (Z/96Z)* = C_2 X C_2 X C_8, and there is no other m such that (Z/mZ)* = C_2 X C_2 X C_8, so 24 is a term.
