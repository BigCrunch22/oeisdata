%N A319431 The first differences (A319430) of the tribonacci representation numbers (A003726 or A278038) consists of runs of 1's separated by the terms of the present sequence.
%C A319431 The runs of 1's in A319430 have lengths that apparently are given by A275925 (with a slight change at the start). The present sequence shows the terms greater than 1.
%C A319431 Let b = "2,3,2", c = "2,3,2,5,2,3", d = "2,3,2,5,2". The sequence appears to consist of a word over the alphabet {b,c,d} interspersed with the sequence 10, 19, 10, 37, 10, 19, 74, 10, 19, 10, 37, 10, 147, 10, 19, 10, 37, 10, ...:
%C A319431 c, 10, d, 19, c, 10, b, 37, c, 10, d, 19, c, 74, c, 10, d, 19, c, 10, b, 37, c, 10, d, 147, c, 10, d, 19, c, 10, b, 37, c, 10, d, 19, c, 74, ...
%C A319431 The interspersed sequence 10, 19, 10, 37, 10, 19, 74, ... appears to have the same kind of structure.
%C A319431 It would be nice to have a recurrence of some kind that produces this sequence.
