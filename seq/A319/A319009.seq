%N A319009 Numbers k such that the multiplicative order of 2 modulo k is psi(k), psi = A002322.
%C A319009 Numbers k such that the multiplicative order of 2 modulo k is at its maximum possible value.
%C A319009 Numbers k such that the binary expansion of 1/k has period psi(n).
%C A319009 Numbers k such that A002326((k-1)/2) = A002322(k).
%C A319009 This is a generalization of A167791, so A167791 is a proper subsequence.
%C A319009 Write k as k = Product_{i=1..t} (p_i)^(e_i) where p_i are distinct primes. If (p_i)^(e_i) belongs to A167791 (and thus here) for 1 <= i <= t, then k is also here, but the converse is not true. In fact, this sequence has terms such that none of (p_i)^(e_i) belongs to A167791, the smallest of which is 301 = 7*43. The multiplicative order of 2 modulo 7 and 43 are 3 (< psi(7) = 6) and 14 (< psi(43) = 42), so the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 301 is lcm(3, 14) = 42 = psi(301).

%e A319009 The multiplicative order of 2 modulo 15 is 4 = A002322(15), so 15 is a term.
%e A319009 The multiplicative order of 2 modulo 21 is 6 = A002322(21), so 21 is a term.
%e A319009 The multiplicative order of 2 modulo 51 is 8, but A002322(51) = 16, so 51 is not a term.
