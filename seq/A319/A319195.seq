%N A319195 Irregular triangle with the unique representation of positive integers in the tribonacci ABC-representation.
%C A319195 The row length L(n) of this irregular triangle is A316714(n), n >= 1.
%C A319195 This representation is based on the complementary and disjoint sets A, B and C given by the sequences A278040, A278039 and A278041, respectively. In the present notation sequences A, B and C are denoted by 1, 0 and 2.
%C A319195 The numbers are represented by iterations of these sequences always starting with B(0) = 0 (in analogy to the Wythoff B sequence in the Fibonacci case). Uniqueness requires that the representations end in A(B(0)) or C(B(0)).
%C A319195 B^[k](0) (k-fold iterations) for k >= 2 are forbidden. One could represent the number 0 by B(0), but this is not done here, because it is found that the ABC-representations of positive numbers is equivalent to the tribonacci representation of positive numbers given in A278038 for n >= 1 (n = 0 is not represented by T(1) = A000073(1) = 0. This representation uses the tribonacci numbers {T(k)}_{k >= 3} = {1, 2, 4, 7, 13, ...} for uniqueness reason).
%C A319195 For this table the operation of sequences A, B and C is denoted by 1, 0 and 2, respectively, and the brackets and the final argument (0) of B(0) are not recorded. E.g., A(B(C(B(0)))) is written as 1020.
%C A319195 Another form of this table is given in A316713 where A, B and C are denoted 2, 1 and 3, respectively.
%C A319195 An equivalent such representation is given by A317206 using different complementary sequences A, B and C, related to our B = A278039,  A = A278040, and C = A278041: A(n) = A003144(n) = A278039(n-1) + 1, B(n) = A003145(n) =  A278040(n-1) + 1, C(n) = A003146(n) = A278041(n-1) + 1 with n >= 1.
%C A319195 The present representation is the analog to the Wythoff representation of positive numbers (A189921 or A317208) using the Wythoff A and B sequences A000201 and A001950, respectively.
%C A319195 The number length of the ABC-representation of n >= 1 is L(n) = A316714(n). The number of 0's (B's), 1's (A's) and 2's (C's) of the representation of n is A316715, A316716, A316717.
