%N A319326 a(n) is the number of column convex polyglasses (polyiamonds which need only touch at corners) with n cells.
%C A319326 A polyglass is column convex if the intersection of its interior with any vertical line through the centers of the cells is connected.

%e A319326 There are four triglasses that are not column convex. So a(2) = A319324(3) - 4 = 84.
%Y A319326 Cf. A319324 (fixed polyglasses), A319325 (row convex polyglasses), A319323 (column convex polyiamonds).
