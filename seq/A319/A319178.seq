%N A319178 a(n) is the number of decompositions of 2n into an unordered sum of two odd primes p and q such that at least one number among p-6 and q-6 is also prime, and both p and q are greater than 3.
%C A319178 It is conjectured that a(n) > 0 for n >= 8. (Conjecture 1)
%C A319178 If we categorize primes into the following four sets:
%C A319178 a) Even prime: 2
%C A319178 b) 3-multiple prime: 3
%C A319178 c) primes of the form 6m-1, i.e., 5, 11, 17, 23, 29, 41, ...
%C A319178 d) primes of the form 6m+1, i.e., 7, 13, 19, 31, 37, 43, ...
%C A319178 then the decomposition of an even number can also be categorized accordingly:
%C A319178 1) cannot do so: 2;
%C A319178 2) contains 2: only 4;
%C A319178 3) contains 3: 6=3+3, 8=3+5, 10=3+7, 14=3+11, ...  Obviously not all even numbers belong to this category;
%C A319178 4) contains only primes from prime category c): 10=5+5, 16=5+11, 22=5+17, ...  It is conjectured that all even numbers of the form 6m+4, m >= 1 belong to this category (Conjecture 2);
%C A319178 5) contains one prime from category c) and one prime from category d): 12=5+7, 18=5+13, 24=5+19, ...  It is conjectured that all even numbers of the form 6m, m > 1 belong to this category (Conjecture 3);
%C A319178 6) contains two primes from prime category d): 14=7+7, 20=7+13, 26=7+19, ...  It is conjectured that all even numbers of the form 6m+2, m > 1 belong to this category (Conjecture 4).
%C A319178 It is obvious that categories 4), 5), 6) have no elements in common.
%C A319178 For even numbers 2k in category 4), 5), and 6), if there exists a pair of dual prime composition 2k=p+q such that p-6 or q-6 is prime too, at least one pair of 2k's decomposition p+q can be generated from 2k-6's decomposition p-6,q or p,q-6.
%C A319178 Thus, if Conjecture 1 is true, the Goldbach conjecture is true.
%e A319178 For n=8, 2n=16, 16=5+11, and 11-6=5 is also prime.  So a(8)=1;
%e A319178 ...
%e A319178 For n=18, 2n=36, 36=5+31,17+19,23+13,29+7, where in number pair (5,31), both 5-6=-1 and 31-6=25 are not prime, and at least one number in other pairs less 6 are prime: 17-6=11, 19-6=13, 23-6=17, 13-6=7, 29-6=23.  So a(18)=3.
%t A319178 Table[m = 2*n; ct = 0; p = 3; While[While[p = NextPrime[p]; cp = m - p; ! PrimeQ[cp]]; (2*p) <= m, If[PrimeQ[p - 6] || PrimeQ[cp - 6], ct++]]; ct, {n, 1, 86}]
