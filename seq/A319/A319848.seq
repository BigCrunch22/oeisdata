%N A319848 Irregular triangle read by rows in which row n lists the even divisors of n in decreasing order together with the odd divisors of n in decreasing order.
%C A319848 Consider the diagram with overlapping periodic curves that appears in the Links section (figure 1). The number of curves that contain the point [n,0] equals the number of divisors of n. The simpler interpretation of the diagram is that the curve of diameter d represents the divisor d of n. Now here we introduce a new interpretation: the curve of diameter d that contains the point [n,0] represents the divisor c of n, where c = n/d. This model has the property that each odd quadrant centered at [n,0] contains the curves that represent the even divisors of n, and each even quadrant centered at [n,0] contains the curves that represent the odd divisors of n.
%C A319848 We can find the n-th row of the triangle as follows:
%C A319848 Consider only the semicircumferences that contain the point [n,0].
%C A319848 If n is an even number, in the first quadrant from bottom to top we can see the curves that represent the even divisors of n in decreasing order. Also we can see these curves in the third quadrant from top to bottom.
%C A319848 Then, in the second quadrant from bottom to top we can see the curves that represent the odd divisors of n in decreasing order. Also we can see these curves in the fourth quadrant from top to bottom (see example).

%e A319848 For n = 12 the divisors of 12 are [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]. The even divisors of 12 in decreasing order are [12, 6, 4, 2], and the odd divisors of 12 in decreasing order are [3, 1], so the 12th row of triangle is [12, 6, 4, 2, 3, 1].
%e A319848 On the other hand, consider the diagram that appears in the Links section (figure 1). Then consider only the semicircumferences that contain the point [12,0]. In the first quadrant, from bottom to top, we can see the curves with diameters [1, 2, 3, 6]. Also we can see these curves in the third quadrant from top to bottom. The associated numbers c = 12/d are [12, 6, 4, 2] respectively. These are the even divisors of n in decreasing order. Then, in the second quadrant, from bottom to top, we can see the curves with diameters [4, 12]. Also we can see these curves in the fourth quadrant from top to bottom. The associated numbers c = 12/d are [3, 1] respectively. These are the odd divisors of 12 in decreasing order. Finally all numbers c obtained are [12, 6, 4, 2, 3, 1] equaling the 12th row of triangle.
%e A319848 From _David A. Corneth_, Jan 17 2019: (Start)
%e A319848 For n = 100, we have n even so first even divisors in decreasing order and then odd divisors in decreasing order. The even divisors of 100 are twice the divisors of 100/2 = 50. Those divisors, in decreasing order, are: 100, 50, 20, 10, 4, 2.
%e A319848 The odd divisors of 100 in decreasing order are the odd divisors of the odd part of 100, which is 25. Those divisors are 25, 5, 1.
%e A319848 Concatenating all these divisors gives: 100, 50, 20, 10, 4, 2, 25, 5, 1. (End)
