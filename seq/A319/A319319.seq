%N A319319 Heinz numbers of integer partitions such that every distinct submultiset has a different GCD.
%C A319319 The Heinz number of an integer partition (y_1, ..., y_k) is prime(y_1) * ... * prime(y_k).
%C A319319 First differs from A304713 (Heinz numbers of pairwise indivisible partitions) at A304713(58) = 165, which is absent from this sequence because its prime indices are {2,3,5} and GCD(2,3) = GCD(2,3,5) = 1. The first term with more than two prime factors is 17719, which has prime indices {6,10,15}. The first term with more than two prime factors that is absent from A318716 is 296851, which has prime indices {12,20,30}.
%e A319319 The sequence of partitions whose Heinz numbers are in the sequence begins: (), (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (3,2), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (5,2), (4,3), (12), (13), (14), (15), (7,2), (16), (5,3).
