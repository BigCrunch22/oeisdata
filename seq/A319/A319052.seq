%N A319052 Numbers that are not the sum of {2 squares, a nonnegative cube, and a nonnegative k-th power with k >= 17}.
%C A319052 Subsequence of A022552.
%C A319052 Except for the above 7 terms, the remaining 427 numbers in A022552 can be expressed as the sum of two squares, a nonnegative cube and a nonnegative k-th power. So a(n) has only 7 terms, until n = 10^10.
%C A319052 Also, for n <= 6*10^7, when k = 3, the number of such forms is only 23; when 4 <= k <= 5, only 23 and 71; when k = 6, only 23, 71 and 455; when 7 <= k <= 8, only 23, 71 and 120; when 9 <= k <= 11, only 23, 71, 120, 312 and 455; when 12 <= k <= 16, only 23, 71, 120, 312, 455 and 2136.
