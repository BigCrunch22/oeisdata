%N A319018 Number of ON cells after n generations of two-dimensional automaton based on knight moves (see Comments for definition).
%C A319018 The cells are the squares of the standard square grid.
%C A319018 Cells are either OFF or ON, once they are ON they stay ON forever.
%C A319018 Each cell has 8 neighbors, the cells that are a knight's move away.
%C A319018 We begin in generation 1 with a single ON cell.
%C A319018 A cell is turned ON at generation n+1 if it has exactly one ON neighbor at generation n.
%C A319018 (Since cells stay ON, an equivalent definition is that a cell is turned ON at generation n+1 if it has exactly one neighbor that has been turned ON at some earlier generation. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 19 2018)
%C A319018 This sequence has similarities with A151725: here we use knight moves, there we use king moves.
%C A319018 This is a knight's-move version of the Ulam-Warburton cellular automaton (see A147562). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 21 2018
%C A319018 The structure has dihedral D_8 symmetry (quarter-turn rotations plus reflections, which generate the dihedral group D_8 of order 8), so A319019 is a multiple of 8 (compare A322050). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 16 2018
%C A319018 From _Omar E. Pol_, Dec 16 2018: (Start)
%C A319018 For n >> 1 (for example: n = 257) the structure of this sequence is similar to the structure of both A194270 and of A220500, the D-toothpick cellular automata of the second kind and of the third kind respectively. The animations of both CAs are in the Applegate's movie version.
%C A319018 Also, the graph of A319018 is a bit similar to the graph of A245540, which is essentially a 45-degree-3D-wedge of A245542 (a pyramid) which is the partial sums of A160239 (Fredkin's replicator). See "Plot 2": A319018 vs. A245540. (End)
%C A319018 The conjecture that A322050(2^k+1)=1 also suggests a fractal geometry. Let P_k be the associated set of eight points. It appears that P_k may be written as the intersection of four fixed lines, y = +-2*x and x = +-2*y, with a circle, x^2 + y^2 = 5*4^k (see linked image "Log-Periodic Coloring"). - _Bradley Klee_, Dec 16 2018
%C A319018 In many of these toothpick or cellular automata sequences it is common to see graphs which look like some version of the famous blancmange curve (also known as the Takagi curve). I expect that is what we are seeing when we look at the graph of A322049, although we probably need to go a lot further out before the true shape becomes apparent. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 17 2018
%C A319018 The graph of A322049 (related to first differences of this sequence) appears to have rather a self-similar structure which repeats at powers of 2, and more specifically at 2^10 = 1024. There is no central symmetry or continuity, which are characteristic properties of the blancmange curve. - _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 28 2018
%C A319018 The 8 points added in generation n = 2^k + 1 are P_k = 2^k*K where K = {(+-2, +-1), (+-1, +-2)} is the set of the initial 8 knight moves. So P_k is indeed the intersection of the rays of slope +-1/2 resp. +-2 and a circle of radius 2^k*sqrt(5). In the subsequent generation n = 2^k + 2, the new cells switched on are exactly the 7 "new" knight move neighbors of these 8 cells, (P_k + K) \ (2^k - 1)*K. The 8th neighbor, lying one knight move closer to the origin, has been switched on in generation 2^k, together with an octagonal "wall" consisting of every other cell on horizontal and vertical segments between these points (2^k - 1)*K, and all cells on the diagonal segments between these points, as well as 2 more diagonals just next to these (on the inner side) and shorter by 2 cells (so they are empty for k = 1). This yields 4*(2 + (2^k - 2)*(1+3)) new ON cells in generation 2^k, plus 8*(2^(k-1) - 2) more new ON cells on horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines 4 units closer to the origin for k > 2, and similar additional terms for k > 4 etc. - _M.
