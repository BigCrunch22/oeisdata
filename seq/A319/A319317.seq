%N A319317 Numbers k such that A090616(k) > A054861(k).
%C A319317 Numbers k such that the highest power of 12 dividing n! is determined by the highest power of 3 dividing n!.
%C A319317 Note that A054861 and A090616 are both asymptotic to a(n) = n/2 + O(log(n)), nevertheless, it seems that the number of k such that A090616(k) is bigger predominates. Conjecture: the ratio of k <= N such that A090616(k) >A054861(k) tends to 1 as N tends to infinity, while the ratio of k <= N such thatA090616(k) < A054861(k) and A090616(k) = A054861(k) both tend to 0.

%e A319317 The highest power of 3 dividing 8! is 3^2, while the highest power of 4 dividing 8! is 4^3, so 8 is a term, and the highest power of 12 dividing 8! is 12^2.
%e A319317 The highest power of 3 dividing 16! is 3^6, while the highest power of 4 dividing 16! is 4^7, so 16 is a term, and the highest power of 12 dividing 16! is 12^6.
