%N A319769 Number of non-isomorphic intersecting set multipartitions (multisets of sets) of weight n whose dual is also an intersecting set multipartition.
%C A319769 The dual of a multiset partition has, for each vertex, one part consisting of the indices (or positions) of the parts containing that vertex, counted with multiplicity. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,2}} is {{1},{1,2,2}}.
%C A319769 The weight of a multiset partition is the sum of sizes of its parts. Weight is generally not the same as number of vertices.
%C A319769 A multiset partition is intersecting iff no two parts are disjoint. The dual of a multiset partition is intersecting iff every pair of distinct vertices appear together in some part.
%e A319769 Non-isomorphic representatives of the a(1) = 1 through a(5) = 7 set multipartitions:
%e A319769 1: {{1}}
%e A319769 2: {{1,2}}
%e A319769    {{1},{1}}
%e A319769 3: {{1,2,3}}
%e A319769    {{2},{1,2}}
%e A319769    {{1},{1},{1}}
%e A319769 4: {{1,2,3,4}}
%e A319769    {{3},{1,2,3}}
%e A319769    {{1,2},{1,2}}
%e A319769    {{2},{2},{1,2}}
%e A319769    {{1},{1},{1},{1}}
%e A319769 5: {{1,2,3,4,5}}
%e A319769    {{4},{1,2,3,4}}
%e A319769    {{2,3},{1,2,3}}
%e A319769    {{2},{1,2},{1,2}}
