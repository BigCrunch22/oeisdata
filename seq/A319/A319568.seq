%N A319568 Given the two curves y = exp(-x) and y = 2/(exp(x) + exp(x/2)), draw a line tangent to both. This sequence is the decimal expansion of the (negated) x-coordinate of the point at which the line touches y = 2/(exp(x) + exp(x/2)).
%C A319568 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jun 01 2020: (Start)
%C A319568 The calculations in this sequence and in A319569 are needed for the estimation of the Shapiro cyclic sum constant lambda = A086277 = phi(0)/2 = A245330/2. This was done in Drinfel'd (1971).
%C A319568 Here phi(x) is the convex hull of y = exp(-x) and y = 2/(exp(x) + exp(x/2)); i.e., phi(x) = 2/(exp(x) + exp(x/2)) for x <= b; phi(x) = exp(-c) + ((2/(exp(b) + exp(b/2)) - exp(-c))/(b - c)) * (x - c) for b <= x <= c; and phi(x) = exp(-x) for x >= c. (For b <= x <= c, we have the equation of the line segment tangent to both curves.)
%C A319568 As stated below, b = -0.200811... (current sequence) and c = 0.15519... (A319569).
%C A319568 It follows that phi(0) = exp(-c) - c * ((2/(exp(b) + exp(b/2)) - exp(-c))/(b - c)) (where the y-axis crosses the line segment). Or by using the tangent line at x = c to the curve y = exp(-x), we find phi(0) = exp(-c)*(c + 1). Or by using the tangent line at x = b to the curve y = 2/(exp(x) + exp(x/2)), we may get a third formula for phi(0).
%C A319568 By using the above information, we get a system of two equations with two unknowns (b and c). See the PARI program below that may be used to calculate b.
%C A319568 Similar calculations were done by Elbert (1973) for the Shapiro cyclic sum constant mu = psi(0) = A086278. The corresponding curves are y = (1 + exp(x))/2 and y = (1 + exp(x))/(1 + exp(x/2)), while the corresponding x-coordinates at the tangent points are b' = -0.33060... and c' = 0.38875... (not in the OEIS yet). Here psi(x) is the convex hull of these two curves (and it becomes a line segment tangent to both curves for b' <= x <= c').
%C A319568 _Eric W. Weisstein_, in the link below, has a summary of the above discussion (with contributions by _Steven Finch_). (End)
