%N A319490 Number of non-isomorphic connected graphs on n vertices with representation number 3.
%C A319490 These are graphs that can be represented by words having three copies of each letter, but cannot be represented by words having two copies of each letter. In a word representing a graph G, letters x and y alternate if any only if there is an edge between x and y in G.
