%N A319771 Let f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1 + i (where i denotes the imaginary unit), f(3) = 2 + i, and for n > 2, f(n+1) is the Gaussian integer in the first quadrant (with positive real part and nonnegative imaginary part) with least modulus and sharing at least one prime factor with f(n-1) but none with f(n) (in case of a tie, minimize the imaginary part); a(n) = the real part of f(n).
%C A319771 See A319770 for the square of the modulus of f and additional comments.
