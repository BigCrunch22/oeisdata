%N A319321 a(n) is the number of d+/d- diagonally convex polyplets (polyominoes which need only touch at corners) with n cells.
%C A319321 A polyplet is d+ [d-] diagonally convex if the intersection of its interior with any line of slope 1 [-1] through the centers of the cells is connected.
%H A319321 Adam Gruber, <a href="https://devweb3000.cis.strath.ac.uk/~xpb16190/LatticeAnimals/LatticeAnimals.jar">Java program to count lattice animals</a>.
%e A319321 The only tetraplets that are not d+ diagonally convex are two animals consisting of a horizontal domino and a vertical domino joined at a corner. So a(4) = A006770(4) - 2 = 108.
%Y A319321 Cf. A006770 (fixed polyplets), A187077 (row convex polyplets), A187276 (d+/d- diagonally convex polyominoes).
