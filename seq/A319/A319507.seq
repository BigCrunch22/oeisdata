%N A319507 Smallest number of multiplicative-additive divisors persistence n.
%C A319507 To compute the "multiplicative-additive divisors persistence" of a number, we proceed as follows. Form the product of the digits of the number (A007954) divided by the sum of the digits (A007953). Repeat this process until you reach 0 or 1. If we reach a non-integer, we write 0. The "multiplicative-additive divisors persistence" is the number of steps to reach 0 or 1.
%C A319507 For instance: the multiplicative-additive divisors persistence of 874 is 1, because 874 -> 8 * 7 * 4 / (8 + 7 + 4) = 224/19. This is not an integer, so the process stops after one step.
%e A319507 The multiplicative additive divisors persistence of 24778899 is 4: 24778899 -> (2032128/54=) 37632 -> (756/21=) 36 -> (18/9=) 2 -> (2/2=) 1.
