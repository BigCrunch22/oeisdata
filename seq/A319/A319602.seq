%N A319602 Numbers with at least two representations as truncated triangular numbers.
%C A319602 A truncated triangular number is a figurate number, the number of dots in a hexagonal diagram where the side lengths alternate between two values. Include a number in this list if there are two different side-length pairs that give the same count.
%C A319602 The underlying quadratic form is (4ab + a(a-3) + b(b-3) + 2)/2; n is in the list if n can be expressed in this form in two different ways, where a <= b. (That is, exchanging a and b is not considered different.)
%C A319602 A number occurs at least three times in A008867 if and only if it occurs in this sequence.
%e A319602 75 is in the list because there are 75 dots in both the (2,10) hexagon and the (5,6) hexagon.
