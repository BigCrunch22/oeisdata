%N A319215 Decimal expansion of AGHM(1,i,1+i)/(1+i), where i is the imaginary unit and AGHM stands for arithmetic-geometric-harmonic mean of a triple of numbers.
%C A319215 As AGM(x1,x2) is the well-known arithmetic-geometric mean of a pair of numbers x1 and x2, we can also define the AGHM(x1,x2,x3) as the arithmetic-geometric-harmonic mean of a triple of numbers x1, x2 and x3.
%C A319215 These three means were chosen because the arithmetic mean is the power mean with power = 1, the geometric mean is the power mean with power = 0 (lim_{power -> 0}) and the harmonic mean is the power mean with power = -1.
%C A319215 Definition of AGHM(x1,x2,x3), for arbitrary triple x1,x2,x3:
%C A319215 x1(0) = x1, x2(0) = x2, x3(0) = x3,
%C A319215 x1(n) = (x1(n-1) + x2(n-1) + x3(n-1))/3,
%C A319215 x2(n) = (x1(n-1) * x2(n-1) * x3(n-1))^(1/3),
%C A319215 x3(n) = 3/(1/x1(n-1) + 1/x2(n-1) + 1/x3(n-1)),
%C A319215 lim_{n -> inf} x1(n) = lim_{n -> inf} x2(n) = lim_{n -> inf} x3(n) = AGHM(x1,x2,x3).
