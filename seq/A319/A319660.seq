%N A319660 2-rank of the class group of imaginary quadratic field with discriminant -k, k = A039957(n).
%C A319660 The p-rank of a finite abelian group G is equal to log_p(#{x belongs to G : x^p = 1}) where p is a prime number. In this case, G is the class group of Q(sqrt(-k)), and #{x belongs to G : x^p = 1} is the number of genera of Q(sqrt(-k)) (cf. A003641).
