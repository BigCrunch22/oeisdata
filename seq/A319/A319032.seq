%N A319032 Length of segments delimited by the letter "u" when the sequence is spelled out in French.
%C A319032 Translate the sequence S to French, to get French(S) = UN, SIX, HUIT, CINQ, HUIT, NEUF, TROIS, HUIT, CINQ, NEUF, HUIT, CINQ, HUIT, NEUF, TROIS, NEUF, TROIS, HUIT, NEUF, TROIS, HUIT, CINQ, NEUF, ...
%C A319032 Then insert a stroke immediately after each letter "U" of S: U|N, SIX, HU|IT, CINQ, HU|IT, NEU|F, TROIS, HU|IT, CINQ, NEU|F, HU|IT, CINQ, HU|IT, NEU|F, TROIS, NEU|F, TROIS, HU|IT, NEU|F, TROIS, HU|IT, CINQ, NEU|F, ..."
%C A319032 Now the length of each chunk is given by the sequence S itself. In case of several possible choices compatible with this property, we require the smallest one to be chosen.
%C A319032 After the 2nd term, the only integers used are 3, 5, 8 and 9 in a seemingly chaotic order.
%C A319032 The author does not know if the sequence enters into a loop at some point. The shortest such known loop in French is [4,3,8] for segments delimited by the letter "T": QUAT|RE, T|ROIS, HUIT|, QUAT|RE, T|ROIS, HUIT|, QUAT|RE, T|ROIS, HUIT|, ...
%Y A319032 Cf. A230763 for an English sequence with segments delimited by the letter "e" and A243992 for a base-10 sequence with segments delimited by the digit "1".
