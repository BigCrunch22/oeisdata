%N A319511 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of Boolean functions on n variables having an algebraic degree equal to k (for n >= 0 and 0 <= k <= n).
%C A319511 The canonical representation of a given Boolean function f of n variables by its Algebraic Normal Form (ANF) is a multivariate polynomial of the form f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)= a + M_1 + M_2 + ... + M_s, where a is the Boolean constant 0 or 1, the + sign denotes sum modulo 2 (XOR) between different monomials, and 0 <= s < 2^n. The monomial M_i is a conjunction of some of these variables, for i= 1, 2, ..., s. The algebraic degree of a monomial is the number of variables in the monomial and the algebraic degree of a Boolean function is the maximum degree of the monomials. There are binomial(n, k) monomials of k variables, for k= 0, 1, ..., n. The case k= 0 means that no one of the variables is chosen to form a monomial. It corresponds to the Boolean constant 1, which is considered as a monomial. Its algebraic degree is equal to 0 and so T(n,0)= 1, for n= 0, 1, ... The zero constant is not considered as a monomial. It corresponds to the empty set - the case when no one of the possible monomials is chosen to form an ANF. Its algebraic degree is defined usually as -infinity. That is why the zero constant is not represented in the triangle.
%C A319511 The set of all Boolean functions of n variables can be partitioned into subsets in accordance with their algebraic degrees. The n-th row of the triangle represents the cardinalities of these subsets. Thus the sum of all numbers in the n-th row is the number of all Boolean functions of n variables - 1 (because of the zero constant), i.e., 2^(2^n)-1.
%C A319511 Equivalently, the number of nonempty sets of subsets of an n-set such that the maximum cardinality of the subsets is k. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Sep 23 2018
