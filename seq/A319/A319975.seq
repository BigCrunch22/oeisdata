%N A319975 Smallest number of complexity n with respect to the operations {1, shift, multiply}.
%C A319975 The shift operation here is also sometimes called successor, see A263283.
%C A319975 Note this complexity measure counts both operands (the ones) and operators (the shifts and multiplications), whereas most of the complexity measures in the crossrefs count only operands. However, in the presence of successor it would not make sense to count only operands, since any number can be expressed with a single occurrence of 1. - _Glen Whitney_, Oct 06 2021
