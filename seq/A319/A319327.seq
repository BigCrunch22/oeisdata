%N A319327 Heinz numbers of integer partitions such that every distinct submultiset has a different LCM.
%C A319327 Note that such a Heinz number is necessarily squarefree, as such a partition is necessarily strict.
%C A319327 The Heinz number of an integer partition (y_1, ..., y_k) is prime(y_1) * ... * prime(y_k).
%C A319327 First differs from A304713 (Heinz numbers of pairwise indivisible partitions) at A304713(642) = 2093, which is absent from this sequence because its prime indices are {4,6,9} and LCM(4,9) = LCM(4,6,9) = 36.
%e A319327 The sequence of partitions whose Heinz numbers are in the sequence begins: (), (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (3,2), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (5,2), (4,3), (12), (13), (14), (15), (7,2).
