%N A319625 Number of non-isomorphic connected weight-n antichains of distinct sets whose dual is also an antichain of distinct sets.
%C A319625 The dual of a multiset partition has, for each vertex, one block consisting of the indices (or positions) of the blocks containing that vertex, counted with multiplicity. For example, the dual of {{1,2},{2,2}} is {{1},{1,2,2}}.
%C A319625 The weight of a multiset partition is the sum of sizes of its parts. Weight is generally not the same as number of vertices.
%F A319625 Euler transform is A319638.
%e A319625 Non-isomorphic representatives of the a(1) = 1 through a(10) = 3 antichains:
%e A319625                {{1}}
%e A319625         {{1,2},{1,3},{2,3}}
%e A319625      {{1,2},{1,3},{2,4},{3,4}}
%e A319625     {{1,2},{1,3},{1,4},{2,3,4}}
%e A319625    {{1,3},{2,4},{1,2,5},{3,4,5}}
%e A319625   {{1,2},{1,3},{2,4},{3,5},{4,5}}
%e A319625   {{1,3},{1,4},{2,3},{2,4},{3,4}}
