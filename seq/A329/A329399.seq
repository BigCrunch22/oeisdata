%N A329399 Numbers whose reversed binary expansion has uniform Lyndon factorization.
%C A329399 We define the Lyndon product of two or more finite sequences to be the lexicographically maximal sequence obtainable by shuffling the sequences together. For example, the Lyndon product of (231) with (213) is (232131), the product of (221) with (213) is (222131), and the product of (122) with (2121) is (2122121). A Lyndon word is a finite sequence that is prime with respect to the Lyndon product. Equivalently, a Lyndon word is a finite sequence that is lexicographically strictly less than all of its cyclic rotations. Every finite sequence has a unique (orderless) factorization into Lyndon words, and if these factors are arranged in lexicographically decreasing order, their concatenation is equal to their Lyndon product. For example, (1001) has sorted Lyndon factorization (001)(1).
%C A329399 A sequence of words is uniform if they all have the same length.
