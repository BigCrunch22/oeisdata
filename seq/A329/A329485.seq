%N A329485 Odd numbers k such that there are no consecutive prime numbers p, q such that 2*(p - k) = q + k.
%C A329485 The complementary sequence that include the numbers k which do satisfy 2*(p - k) = q + k is {1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 13, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 31, 33, 35, 41, 43, 45, 49, 53, 57, 59, ...}. The number 7 does not satisfy the formula, so is the first term of sequence.
%C A329485 The terms of the sequence are the multiples of 3 not included in A062234 and divided by 3.
%e A329485 7 is a term because 2*(p - 7) <> q + 7 for every p, q consecutive prime numbers. See comments.
