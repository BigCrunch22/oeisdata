%e A329079 a(2) = 1 as a(1) = 0 has one digit, and there is one previous entry before a(1) that has one digit.
%e A329079 a(12) = 0 as a(11) = 10 has two digits, and there are no previous entries before a(11) that have two digits.
%e A329079 a(13) = 11 as a(12) = 0 has one digit, and there are eleven previous entries before a(12) that have one digit.
