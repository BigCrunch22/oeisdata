%N A329412 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive numbers such that among the pairwise sums of any four consecutive terms there are exactly two prime sums.
%C A329412 Conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers: a(10^5) = 10^5, a(10^6) = 999984 and all numbers below 99992 resp. 999963 have appeared by then. See A329452 for a more detailed discussion. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 15 2019

%e A329412 a(1) = 1 is the smallest possible choice; there are no other restrictions so far.
%e A329412 a(2) = 2 as 2 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction. Note that as 1 + 2 = 3 we already have one prime sum (of the required two) with the quadruplet {1, 2, a(3), a(4)}.
%e A329412 a(3) = 3 as 3 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction. Note that as 2 + 3 = 5 we now have the two prime sums required with the quadruplet {1,2,5,a(4)}.
%e A329412 a(4) = 7 as a(4) = 4, 5 or 6 would lead to a contradiction: indeed, both the quadruplets {1, 2, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3, 5} and {1, 2, 3, 6} will produce three prime sums (instead of two). With a(4) = 7 we have the quadruplet {1, 2, 3, 7} and the two prime sums we are looking for: 1 + 2 = 3 and 2 + 3 = 5.
%e A329412 a(5) = 5 as a(5) = 4 would again lead to a contradiction: indeed, the quadruplet {2, 3, 7, 4} will produce three prime sums (instead of two, they would be 2 + 3 = 5; 3 + 4 = 7 and 7 + 4 = 11). With a(5) = 5 the quadruplet {2, 3, 7, 4} shows exactly the two prime sums we are looking for: 2 + 3 = 5 and 3 + 4 = 7.
