%N A329564 For all n >= 0, exactly five sums are prime among a(n+i) + a(n+j), 0 <= i < j < 5; lexicographically earliest such sequence of distinct nonnegative numbers.
%C A329564 That is, there are 5 primes, counted with multiplicity, among the 10 pairwise sums of any 5 consecutive terms.
%C A329564 Conjectured to be a permutation of the nonnegative integers.
%C A329564 If so, then the restriction to [1..oo) is a permutation of the positive integers, but not the smallest such, which is given in A329563. It seems that the two sequences have no common terms beyond a(6) = 8, except for the accidental a(22) = 15 and maybe some later coincidences of this type. There also appears to be no other simple relation between the terms of these sequences, in contrast to, e.g., A055265 vs. A128280. - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 12 2020

%e A329564 For n = 0, we consider pairwise sums among the first 5 terms a(0..4), among which we must have 5 primes. To get a(4), consider first a(0..3) = (0, 1, 2, 3) and the pairwise sums (a(i) + a(j), 0 <= i < j <= 3) = (1; 2, 3; 3, 4, 5) among which there are 4 primes, counted with multiplicity (i.e., the prime 3 is there two times). So the additional term a(4) must give exactly one more prime sum with all of a(0..3). We find that 4 or 5 would give two more primes, but a(4) = 6 gives exactly one more, 1 + 6 = 7.
%e A329564 Now, for n = 1 we forget the initial 0 and consider the pairwise sums of the remaining terms {1, 2, 3, 6}. There are 3 prime sums, so the next term must give two more. The term 4 would give two more (1+4 and 3+4) primes, but thereafter we would have {2, 3, 6, 4} with only 2 prime sums and impossibility to add one term to get three more prime sums: 2+x, 6+x and 4+x can't be all prime for x > 1.
%e A329564 Therefore 4 isn't the next term, and we try a(5) = 5 which indeed gives the required number of primes, and also allows us to continue.
