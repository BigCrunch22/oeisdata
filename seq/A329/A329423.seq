%N A329423 Each term is visited once according to the rule: go left (resp. right) a(n) places if a(n) is prime (resp. not prime), starting at a(1) = 1. Choose a(n) along this journey as the largest possible prime, or else the smallest possible composite, not occurring earlier and compatible with these rules.
%C A329423 More formally: from index i, move to index i - a(i), resp. to i + a(i), if a(i) is prime, resp. not prime.
%C A329423 The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A329423 See A330154 for the lexicographic earliest variant, rather than choosing the largest possible prime (and choosing terms following the journey).

%e A329423 At index i = 1, a(1) = 1 is the smallest available number and possible since it drives to the right. This implies a move of a(1) = 1 place to the right, i.e., to index i = 2.
%e A329423 Then a(2) cannot be 2 or a larger prime, since this would imply a move too far to the left, so we choose the smallest available composite number, a(2) = 4. This takes us 4 places further to the right, to index 2 + 4 = 6.
%e A329423 Then a(6) can be equal to the prime 3, but not 5 which would drive back to a(1) and create a loop, preventing from visiting all terms. This leads to index 6 - 3 = 3.
%e A329423 Then a(3) cannot be 2 which would lead to already visited a(1), nor a larger prime which would take too far to the left. So a(3) = 6, the smallest available composite number. This leads to index 3 + 6 = 9.
%e A329423 Here a(9) can be a prime, the largest possible choice is a(9) = 5, leading to index 9 - 5 = 4.
%e A329423 Now a(4) cannot be 2 nor 3 nor a larger prime. Therefore a(4) = 8, the smallest available composite number. This leads to index 4 + 8 = 12.
