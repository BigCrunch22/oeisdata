%N A329807 Numbers k such that k, k+1, k+2 and k+3 are all sums of a positive square and a positive cube.
%C A329807 It is known that there are infinitely many k such that k, k+1, k+2 are all sums of a positive square and a positive cube (see A055394 and A295787). It is natural to ask if this sequence is infinite. There are 243 members here below 10^9.
%C A329807 There are 2 pairs of consecutive numbers below 10^9: (16597502, 16597503) and (593825496, 593825497). Are there infinitely many k such that k, k+1, k+2, k+3 and k+4 are all sums of a positive square and a positive cube?
