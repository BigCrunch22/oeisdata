%N A329795 a(n) = smallest positive k such that scan_diff(k,n) is a square, where scan_diff is defined in the Comments.
%C A329795 Write i, j in base 10 aligned to right, say
%C A329795 i = bcd...ef
%C A329795 j = .gh...pq
%C A329795 Then scan_diff(i,j) = |b-0| + |c-g| + |d-h| + ... + |e-p| + |f-q|.
%C A329795 Example: scan_diff(12345,909) = 1+2+6+4+4 = 17.
%C A329795 Suggested by the definition of "box" in A329794.
