%N A329393 Number of odd divisors minus number of even divisors of the n-th composite.
%C A329393 The mode, or most frequent value of this sequence is 0, which corresponds to composites with equal number of odd and even divisors, A016825(n), n >= 1. The next most frequent value is 4.
%C A329393 The value 2 does not appear in this sequence, in contrast to A048272, where A048272(p)=2 for every p = odd prime.

%e A329393 a(1) = -1 since the first composite number is 4, which has 1 odd divisor (1), and 2 even divisors (2,4).
%e A329393 a(2) = 0 since the second composite number is 6, which has 2 odd divisors (1,3) and 2 even divisors (2,6).
