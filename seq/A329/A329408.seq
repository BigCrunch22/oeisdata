%N A329408 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive numbers such that among the pairwise sums of any six consecutive terms there is exactly one prime sum.

%e A329408 a(1) = 1 by minimality.
%e A329408 a(2) = 2 as 2 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction. Note that as 1 + 2 = 3 we already have the prime sum we need.
%e A329408 a(3) = 7 as a(3) = 3, 4, 5 or 6 would produce at least one prime sum too many.
%e A329408 a(4) = 8 as a(4) = 3, 4, 5 or 6 would again produce at least one prime sum too many.
%e A329408 a(5) = 13 as a(5) = 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 or 12 would also produce at least one prime sum too many.
%e A329408 a(6) = 14 as a(6) = 14 doesn't produce an extra prime sum - only composite sums.
%e A329408 a(7) = 12 as 12 is the smallest available integer that produces the single prime sum we need among the last 6 integers {2,7,8,13,14,12}, which is 19 = 12 + 7.
%e A329408 And so on.
%Y A329408 Cf. A329333 (3 consecutive terms, exactly 1 prime sum). See also A329450, A329452 onwards.
