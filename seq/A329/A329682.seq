%N A329682 Number of excursions of length n with Motzkin-steps forbidding all consecutive steps of length 2 except UH, UD, HU and DD.
%C A329682 The Motzkin step set is U=(1,1), H=(1,0) and D=(1,-1). An excursion is a path starting at (0,0), ending on the x-axis and never crossing the x-axis, i.e., staying at nonnegative altitude.
%C A329682 This sequence is periodic with a pre-period of length 2 (namely 1, 1) and a period of length 3 (namely 1, 1, 0).
%F A329682 G.f.: (1+t+t^2-t^4)/(1-t^3).
%e A329682 a(6)=1 because we only have one such excursion of length 6, namely UHUDDD. Similarly a(7)=1, since only HUHUDDD is allowed.
%e A329682 More generally, the only possibilities are (HU)^kD^k, U(HU)^(k-1)D^k (aside from trivial cases of length zero or one).
%Y A329682 Cf. A329680, A329683, A329684.
