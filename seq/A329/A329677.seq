%N A329677 Number of excursions of length n with Motzkin-steps consisting only of consecutive steps UH, HD, and DH.
%C A329677 The Motzkin step set is U=(1,1), H=(1,0) and D=(1,-1). An excursion is a path starting at (0,0), ending on the x-axis and never crossing the x-axis, i.e., staying at nonnegative altitude.

%H A329677 <a href="/index/Rec#order_01">Index entries for linear recurrences with constant coefficients</a>, signature (1).
%F A329677 G.f.: 1 + t + t^3 + t^4.
%e A329677 We only have the following four excursions of this type: the empty walk, H, UHD and UHDH.
