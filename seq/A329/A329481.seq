%N A329481 Numbers which are not the sum of two squarefree semiprimes.
%C A329481 Is this a finite sequence?
%C A329481 Most probably yes. Since almost all semiprimes are squarefree, this is essentially the same as A072966. The graph of A072931 would not change qualitatively if only squarefree semiprimes were considered. - _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 03 2019
%e A329481 a(10) = 11 since there is no way to represent 11 as a sum of two squarefree semiprimes. 12 is not a term since 12 = 6 + 6.
%Y A329481 Cf. A006881, A072966.
