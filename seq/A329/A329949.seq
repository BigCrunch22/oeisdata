%N A329949 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive numbers such that following proposition is true: a(n) is the number of occurrences of a(n+1) in the sequence so far, up to and including a(n+1).
%C A329949 It is easy to see how regular the sequence is by transforming it into a triangle with 2k+1 terms in each row, where k runs through the natural numbers. Then one sees that a(k^2) = 1, a(k^2 + 1) = k+1 etc. - _Ivan N. Ianakiev_, Nov 26 2019
%e A329949 a(1) = 1 means that there is 1 a(2) so far in the sequence - which is true, there is one "2" in the sequence up to a(2);
%e A329949 a(2) = 2 means that there are 2 a(3) so far in the sequence - which is true, there are two "2" in the sequence up to a(3);
%e A329949 a(3) = 2 means that there are 2 a(4) so far in the sequence - which is true, there are two "1" in the sequence up to a(4);
%e A329949 a(4) = 1 means that there is 1 a(4) so far in the sequence - which is true, there is one "3" in the sequence up to a(5);
%e A329949 a(5) = 3 means that there are 3 a(6) so far in the sequence - which is true, there are three "2" in the sequence up to a(6); etc.
