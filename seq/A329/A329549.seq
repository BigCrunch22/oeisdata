%N A329549 Numbers 4*k such that 1 is the last integer obtained when 4*k is successively divided by its divisors in increasing order.
%C A329549 At sequence A076933, the question is asked: "What is the longest string of ones in this sequence?" As A076933(4*n) is rarely 1, such a string is not very long. The longest starting below 4*10^8 has length 6 and starts at 141. Checking multiples of 4 may help in finding longer such strings.
%C A329549 Terms are also a multiple of 8. Proof: If m = 8*k + 4 then its divisors are 1, 2, 4 (and maybe 3). After dividing by 4 we have a fraction with denominator 2. Before that we did not see 1.
%e A329549 The divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4 and 8. Dividing from left to right gives 8/1 = 8, 8/2 = 4, 4/4 = 1, and then 1/8 isn't an integer so as the last integer we see is 1, 8 is in the sequence.
%Y A329549 Cf. A076933, A240694 (partial products of divisors of n).
%Y A329549 Subsequence of A008586 (multiples of 4) and of A008590 (multiples of 8).
