%N A329946 Primes that are not of the form u(u+1)/2 - v(v-3)/2 for any u >= v >= 1.
%C A329946 These primes were originally called "hidden primes", but since that term is already in use (see A187399) it has been replaced by an explicit definition. - Editors of OEIS, Dec 16 2019
%C A329946 The following is the original definition. Assume n and s are positive integers. We say a prime p is 'reachable' from n if there exists an s such that 8*(p - (s + 1)*n) + 1 is a perfect square, and that a prime p is 'hidden' if it is not reachable from any n.
%C A329946 Equivalently, a prime p is reachable if there exists m >= n such that p = m(m+1)/2 - n(n-3)/2.
%C A329946 A description of the sequence as an arithmetic training game for children was given on the Sequence Fans Mailing List. A representation as a sieve is given in the Maple script.
%C A329946 The game is to start at n and (cumulatively) add n, n+1, n+2, ..., m until a prime is reached, which appears to happen for all n, usually with m close to n, except for n = 3.
%C A329946 Conjecture: The sequence is infinite.
%C A329946 For comparison the number of primes < 10^n:
%C A329946 n              :  1   2   3    4     5      6       7        8
%C A329946 Ramanujan p.   :  1, 10, 72, 559, 4459, 36960, 316066, 2760321, ...
%C A329946 Hidden primes  :  2, 10, 49, 271, 1768, 34181, 601549,
%C A329946 Lesser twin p. :  2,  8, 35, 205, 1224,  8169,  58980,  440312, ...
%C A329946 All terms except a(1) = 3 are congruent to 5 (mod 6), i.e., in A007528. Indeed, any prime p = 6k + 1 is reached from n = 2k in 2 steps. - _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 16 2019
%C A329946 Only one prime is eliminated (for n != 3) by each (variable sized) "grid" G(n) = (2n, 3n + 1, 4n + 3, 5n + 6, ..., (m+2)n + T(m), ...), since the scan stops as soon as the first prime is found. If used as a sieve in the usual sense, the grid G(n) should also eliminate all subsequent primes of the form (m+2)n + T(m). If this were done, only Fermat primes A019434 = {3, 5, 17, 257, 65537, ?} would remain. - _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 17 2019
