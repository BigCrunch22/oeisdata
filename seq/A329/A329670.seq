%N A329670 Number of excursions of length n with Motzkin-steps allowing only consecutive steps UH and HD.
%C A329670 The Motzkin step set is U=(1,1), H=(1,0) and D=(1,-1). An excursion is a path starting at (0,0), ending on the x-axis and never crossing the x-axis, i.e., staying at nonnegative altitude.
%H A329670 <a href="/index/Rec#order_01">Index entries for linear recurrences with constant coefficients</a>, signature (1).
%F A329670 G.f.: 1+t+t^3.
%e A329670 The only excursions of this type are the empty walk, H and UHD.
