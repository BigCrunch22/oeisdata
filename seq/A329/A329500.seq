%N A329500 Coordination sequence for 1-skeleton of truncated icosahedron or "Buckyball".
%C A329500 The truncated icosahedron is a polyhedron with 60 vertices and 32 faces. There are 20 hexagonal faces and 12 pentagonal faces. It is also known as a "Buckyball". In chemistry this structure is called a fullerene ("Buckminsterfullerene") and has formula C_60.
