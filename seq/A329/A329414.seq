%N A329414 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive numbers such that among the pairwise sums of any six consecutive terms there are exactly two prime sums.
%C A329414 Condition a(1) = 1 follows from minimality. Conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers: a(10^6) = 999994 and all numbers up to there have appeared at that point. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 15 2019

%e A329414 a(1) = 1 by minimality.
%e A329414 a(2) = 2 as 2 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction. Note that as 1 + 2 = 3 we already have one prime sum (on the required two) with the sextuplet {1,2,a(3),a(4),a(5),a(6)}.
%e A329414 a(3) = 3 as 3 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction. Note that as 2 + 3 = 5 we now have the two prime sums required with the sextuplet {1,2,3,a(4),a(5),a(6)}.
%e A329414 a(4) = 7 as a(4) = 4, 5 or 6 would lead to a contradiction: indeed, the sextuplets {1,2,3,4,a(5),a(6)}, {1,2,3,5,a(5),a(6)} and {1,2,3,6,a(5),a(6)} will produce more than the two required prime sums. With a(4) = 7 we have no contradiction as the sextuplet {1,2,3,7,a(5),a(6)} has now exactly two prime sums: 1 + 2 = 3 and 2 + 3 = 5.
%e A329414 a(5) = 13 as a(5) = 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 would again lead to a contradiction (more than 2 prime sums with the sextuplet); in combination with any other term before it, a(5) = 13 will produce only composite sums.
%e A329414 a(6) = 19 as 19 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction: indeed, the sextuplet {1,2,3,7,13,19} shows exactly the two prime sums we are looking for: 1 + 2 = 3 and 2 + 3 = 5.
%e A329414 a(7) = 5 as 5 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction; indeed, the sextuplet {2,3,7,13,19,5} shows exactly two prime sums, which are 2 + 3 = 5 and 2 + 5 = 7.
