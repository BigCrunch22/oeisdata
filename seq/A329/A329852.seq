%N A329852 Numbers having twice as many 1's in their binary expansion as terms in their Zeckendorf expansion.
%C A329852 Numbers k such that A000120(k) = 2 * A007895(k).
%e A329852 The binary expansion of 15, "1111", contains four 1's, and the Zeckendorf expansion contains two terms: 15 = 13 + 2. There are twice as many 1's in the binary expansion, so 15 is in the sequence.
