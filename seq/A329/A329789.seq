%N A329789 Total number of graceful labelings of connected graphs with n vertices and n edges.
%C A329789 In general, consider a connected graph with E edges and V vertices. The vertices are given labels in the range 0 to E so that the differences between edges' endpoints are {1,...,E}. None of the vertices are isolated; hence each vertex label participates in at least one edge. For this sequence E = V = n.
