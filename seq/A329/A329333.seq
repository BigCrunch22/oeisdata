%N A329333 There is exactly one odd prime among the pairwise sums of any three consecutive terms: Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct nonnegative integers with this property.
%C A329333 This is conjectured and designed to be a permutation of the nonnegative integers, therefore the offset is taken to be zero.
%C A329333 Restricted to positive indices, this is a sequence of positive integers having the same property, then conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers. (The word "odd" can be omitted in this case.)
%C A329333 If the word "odd" is dropped from the original definition, the sequence starts (0, 1, 3, 6, 2, 7), and then continues from a(6) = 4 onward as the present sequence. This is again conjectured to be a permutation of the nonnegative integers, and a permutation of the positive integers when restricted to the domain [1..oo). The latter however no longer has the property of lexicographic minimality.

%e A329333 For the first two terms there is no restriction regarding primality, so a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1. (If only positive values and indices are considered, then a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 2.)
%e A329333 Then a(2) must be such that among { 0+1, 0+a(2), 1+a(2) } there is exactly one odd prime, and 2 works.
%e A329333 Then a(3) must be such that among { 1+2, 1+a(3), 2+a(3) } there is only one (odd) prime. Since 1+2 = 3, the other two sums must both yield a composite. This excludes 3, 4, 5 and 6 and the smallest possibility is a(3) = 7.
%e A329333 And so on.
