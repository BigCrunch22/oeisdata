%N A329232 The number of counterclockwise steps during the grasshopper procedure.
%C A329232 The grasshopper procedure: n positions are evenly spaced around a circle, a grasshopper hops randomly to any position, after the k-th hop, the grasshopper looks clockwise and counterclockwise k positions. If one of the positions has been visited less often then the other, it hops there; if both positions have been visited an equal number of times, it hops k steps in the clockwise position. (See Mathematics Stack Exchange link for more details.)
%C A329232 Conjecture: a(n)=0 if and only if n = 2^k.
