%N A329574 For every n >= 0, exactly 10 sums are prime among a(n+i) + a(n+j), 0 <= i < j < 7; lexicographically earliest such sequence of distinct nonnegative numbers.
%C A329574 That is, there are 10 primes, counted with multiplicity, among the 21 pairwise sums of any 7 consecutive terms.
%C A329574 Conjectured to be a permutation of the nonnegative integers.
%C A329574 If it is, then the restriction to [1..oo) is a permutation of the positive integers, but maybe not the lexicographically earliest one with this property.
%C A329574 This is the first example of a sequence of this type for which the greedy choice of a(n) is frequently incorrect beyond the initial terms, see Examples.

%e A329574 At the beginning of the sequence, we must avoid the choice of 6 or 7 for a(6): both appear to be possible at first sight, giving exactly 10 prime sums with n = 0 in the definition, but then make it impossible to find a successor term a(7) for which the definition is satisfied with n = 1.
%e A329574 The same happens again for a(37) and a(58), where the apparently possible value 19 resp. 46 must be avoided.
