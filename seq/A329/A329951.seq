%N A329951 a(n) is the least prime k such that 2*n-1+k = 2*p*q for odd primes p,q (not necessarily distinct).
%C A329951 Dickson's conjecture implies that for every prime p that does not divide 2*n-1, there exist infinitely many q such that q and 2*p*q-(2*n-1) are prime. Thus a(n) always exists.

%e A329951 a(3)=13 because 2*3-1+13 = 18 = 2*3*3 with 13, 3, 3 all primes, and 13 is the least prime for which this works.
