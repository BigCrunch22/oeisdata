%N A329233 The time of the first counterclockwise step during the grasshopper procedure, or 0 if no counterclockwise steps occur.
%C A329233 The grasshopper procedure: n positions are evenly spaced around a circle, a grasshopper hops randomly to any position, after the k-th hop, the grasshopper looks clockwise and counterclockwise k positions. If one of the positions has been visited less often then the other, it hops there; if both positions have been visited an equal number of times, it hops k steps in the clockwise position. (See Mathematics Stack Exchange link for more details.)
%C A329233 Either a(n) = 0 or a(n) >= A003056(n).
%C A329233 Conjecture: a(3^n) = A087503(n-1) + 1 for n > 0. (Checked up to 3^12.) - _Peter Kagey_, Nov 28 2019
