%N A329504 Array read by upward antidiagonals: row n = coordination sequence for cylinder formed by rolling up a strip of width n squares cut from the square grid by cuts at 45 degrees to grid lines.
%C A329504 By the "width" of the strip is meant the number of squares in a corner-to-corner ring around the cylinder.
%C A329504 For the case when the cuts are parallel to grid lines, see A329501.
%C A329504 See A329508 ... for coordination sequences for cylinders formed by rolling up the hexagonal grid ("carbon nanotubes").
%H A329504 N. J. A. Sloane, <a href="/A329504/a329504_1.pdf">Illustration for rows 1 through 5</a>, showing vertices of cylinder labeled with distance from base point (c = n is the width (or circumference)). The cylinders are formed by identifying the black lines.

%F A329504 Let theta = (1+x)/(1-x). The g.f. for the coordination sequence for row n is theta*(1+2x+2x^2+...+2x^(n-1)-(n-1)*x^n).
