%N A329313 Length of the Lyndon factorization of the reversed binary expansion of n.
%C A329313 We define the Lyndon product of two or more finite sequences to be the lexicographically maximal sequence obtainable by shuffling the sequences together. For example, the Lyndon product of (231) with (213) is (232131), the product of (221) with (213) is (222131), and the product of (122) with (2121) is (2122121). A Lyndon word is a finite sequence that is prime with respect to the Lyndon product. Every finite sequence has a unique (orderless) factorization into Lyndon words, and if these factors are arranged in lexicographically decreasing order, their concatenation is equal to their Lyndon product. For example, (1001) has sorted Lyndon factorization (001)(1).
