%N A329326 Length of the co-Lyndon factorization of the reversed binary expansion of n.
%C A329326 First differs from A211100 at a(77) = 3, A211100(77) = 2. The reversed binary expansion of 77 is (1011001), with co-Lyndon factorization (10)(1100)(1), while the binary expansion is (1001101), with Lyndon factorization of (1)(001101).
%C A329326 The co-Lyndon product of two or more finite sequences is defined to be the lexicographically minimal sequence obtainable by shuffling the sequences together. For example, the co-Lyndon product of (231) and (213) is (212313), the product of (221) and (213) is (212213), and the product of (122) and (2121) is (1212122). A co-Lyndon word is a finite sequence that is prime with respect to the co-Lyndon product. Equivalently, a co-Lyndon word is a finite sequence that is lexicographically strictly greater than all of its cyclic rotations. Every finite sequence has a unique (orderless) factorization into co-Lyndon words, and if these factors are arranged in certain order, their concatenation is equal to their co-Lyndon product. For example, (1001) has sorted co-Lyndon factorization (1)(100).
