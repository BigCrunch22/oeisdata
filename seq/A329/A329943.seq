%N A329943 Square array read by antidiagonals: T(n,k) is the number of right total relations between set A with n elements and set B with k elements.
%C A329943 A relation R between set A with n elements and set B with k elements is a subset of the Cartesian product A x B.  A relation R is right total if for each b in B there exists an a in A such that (a,b) in R.  T(n,k) is the number of right total relations and T(k,n) is the number of left total relations: relation R is left total if for each a in A there exists a b in B such that (a,b) in R.

%C A329943 T(n,k) is the number of k X n binary matrices with no 0 rows.
%C A329943 T(n,k) is the number of coverings of [k] by tuples (A_1,...,A_n) in P([k])^n, with P(.) denoting the power set.
%C A329943 Swapping n,k gives A092477 (with k<=n).
