%N A329452 There are exactly two primes in {a(n+i) + a(n+j), 0 <= i < j <= 3} for any n: lexicographically earliest such sequence of distinct nonnegative integers.
%C A329452 That is, there are exactly two primes among the 6 pairwise sums of any four consecutive terms.
%C A329452 Conjectured to be a permutation of the nonnegative numbers.
%C A329452 a(100) = 97, a(1000) = 1001, a(10^4) = 9997, a(10^5) = 10^5, a(10^6) = 999984 and all numbers below 999963 have appeared at that point.
%C A329452 See the wiki page for considerations about existence and surjectivity of the sequence and variants thereof.

%e A329452 We start with a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, the smallest possibilities which do not lead to a contradiction.
%e A329452 Now there are already 2 primes, 0 + 2 and 1 + 2, among the pairwise sums, so the next term must not generate any further prime. Given 0 and 1, primes and (primes - 1) are excluded, and a(3) = 8 is the smallest possible choice.
%e A329452 Now there is only one prime, 1 + 2 = 3, among the pairwise sums using {1, 2, 8}; the next term must produce exactly one additional prime as sum with these. We see that 3 is not possible (2 + 3 = 5 and 8 + 3 = 11), but a(4) = 4 is possible.
%e A329452 Now using {2, 8, 4} we have no prime as a pairwise sum, so the next term must produce two primes among the sums with these terms. Again, 3 would give three primes, but 5 yields exactly two primes, 2 + 5 = 7 and 8 + 5 = 13.
