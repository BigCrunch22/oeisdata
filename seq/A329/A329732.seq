%N A329732 a(n) is the smallest m for which there is a sequence n = b_1 < b_2 < ... < b_t = m such that b_1*b_2*...*b_t is a perfect cube.
%C A329732 For each k there exists a sufficiently large N such that for all primes p > N, a(k*p) = (k+2)*p. [We can prove the proposition is true for N = 64*(t*k)^2, where t = k*(k+1)*(k+2): there is a positive integer x such that t^2*x^3 < k*p < t^2*(x+1)^3 < t^2*x^3*(k+1)/k < (k+1)*p for p > N. So one increasing sequence starting with k*p, ending with (k+2)*p, and having a product which is a perfect cube is (k*p) * (t^2*(x+1)^3) * ((k+1)*p) * ((k+2)*p) = (t*p*(x+1))^3. Noticed that a(k*p) >= (k+2)*p (because b_1*b_2*...*b_t is divisible by p^3) for p > N, so a(k*p) = (k+2)*p. - _Jinyuan Wang_, Dec 22 2021]

%e A329732 For n = 22, one increasing sequence starting with 22, ending with a(22) = 44, and having a product which is a perfect cube is 22 * 24 * 25 * 30 * 32 * 33 * 44 = 2640^3.
