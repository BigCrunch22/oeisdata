%N A329197 Length of the n-th nontrivial cycle of the "ghost iteration" A329200.
%C A329197 A329200 consists in adding or subtracting the number A040115(n) whose digits are the differences of adjacent digits of n, depending on its parity.
%C A329197 Repdigits A010785 are fixed points of this map, but some numbers enter nontrivial cycles. This sequence gives the length of these cycles, ordered by their smallest member, as they are listed in the table A329196. See there for more information.
%e A329197 The first cycle of A329200 is row 1 of A329196, (8290, 8969, 9102), of length 3 = a(1).
%e A329197 The second cycle of A329200 is row 2 of A329196, (17998, 24199, 21819, 20041, 22084, 21800, 20020), of length 7 = a(2).
