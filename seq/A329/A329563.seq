%N A329563 For all n >= 1, exactly five sums are prime among a(n+i) + a(n+j), 0 <= i < j < 5; lexicographically earliest such sequence of distinct positive numbers.
%C A329563 That is, there are 5 primes, counted with multiplicity, among the 10 pairwise sums of any 5 consecutive terms.
%C A329563 Conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A329563 This sequence is quite different from the restriction of the "nonnegative" variant A329564 to positive indices: it seems that the two have no common terms beyond a(6) = 8, except for the accidental a(22) = 15 and maybe some later coincidences of this type. There also appears to be no other simple relation between the terms of these sequences, in contrast to, e.g., A055265 vs. A128280.

%e A329563 For n = 1, we consider pairwise sums among the first 5 terms chosen as small as possible, a(1..5) = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). We see that we have indeed 5 primes among the sums 1+2, 1+3, 1+4, 1+5, 2+3, 2+4, 2+5, 3+4, 3+5, 4+5.
%e A329563 Then, to get a(6), consider first the pairwise sums among terms a(2..5), (2+3, 2+4, 2+5; 3+4, 3+5; 4+5), among which there are 3 primes, counted with multiplicity (i.e., the prime 7 is there two times). So the new term a(6) must give exactly two more prime sums with the terms a(2..5). We find that 6 or 7 would give just one more (5+6 resp. 4+7), but a(6) = 8 gives exactly two more, 3+8 and 5+8.
