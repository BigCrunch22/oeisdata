%N A329407 Among the pairwise sums of any five consecutive terms there is exactly one prime sum; lexicographically earliest such sequence of distinct positive numbers.

%e A329407 a(1) = 1 by minimality.
%e A329407 a(2) = 2 as 2 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction. Note that as 1 + 2 = 3 we already have our prime sum.
%e A329407 a(3) = 7 as a(3) = 3, 4, 5 or 6 would produce at least one prime sum too many.
%e A329407 a(4) = 8 as a(4) = 3, 4, 5 or 6 would again produce at least one prime sum too many.
%e A329407 a(5) = 13 as a(5) = 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 or 12 would also produce at least one prime sum too many.
%e A329407 a(6) = 12 and we have the single prime sum we need among the last 5 integers {2,7,8,13,12}, which is 19 = 12 + 7.
%e A329407 And so on.
%Y A329407 Cf. A329333 (3 consecutive terms, exactly 1 prime sum).
%Y A329407 Cf. A329405: no prime among the pairwise sums of 3 consecutive terms.
%Y A329407 Cf. A329406 .. A329410: exactly 1 prime sum using 4, ..., 10 consecutive terms.
%Y A329407 Cf. A329411 .. A329416: exactly 2 prime sums using 3, ..., 10 consecutive terms.
