%N A329416 Among the pairwise sums of any ten consecutive terms there are exactly two prime sums: lexicographically earliest such sequence of distinct positive numbers.
%C A329416 Conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers: a(10^6) = 10^6 + 2 and all numbers up to 10^6 - 7 have appeared at that point. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 15 2019

%e A329416 a(1) = 1 is the smallest possible choice, there's no restriction on the first term.
%e A329416 a(2) = 2 as 2 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction. Note that as 1 + 2 = 3 we already have one prime sum (on the required two) with the 10-set {1,2,a(3),a(4),a(5),a(6),a(7),a(8),a(9),a(10)}.
%e A329416 a(3) = 3 as 3 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction. Note that as 2 + 3 = 5 we now have the two prime sums required with the 10-set {1,2,a(3),a(4),a(5),a(6),a(7),a(8),a(9),a(10)}.
%e A329416 a(4) = 7 as a(4) = 4, 5 or 6 would lead to a contradiction: indeed, the 10-sets {1,2,3,4,a(5),a(6),a(7),a(8),a(9),a(10)}, {1,2,3,5,a(5),a(6),a(7),a(8),a(9),a(10)} and {1,2,3,6,a(5),a(6),a(7),a(8),a(9),a(10)} will produce more than the two required prime sums. With a(4) = 7 we have no contradiction as the 10-set {1,2,3,7,a(5),a(6),a(7),a(8),a(9),a(10)} has now two prime sums so far: 1 + 2 = 3 and 2 + 3 = 5.
%e A329416 a(5) = 13 as a(5) = 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 would again lead to a contradiction (more than 2 prime sums with the 10-set); in combination with any other term before it, a(5) = 13 will produce only composite sums.
%e A329416 a(6) = 19 as 19 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction: indeed, the 10-set {1,2,3,7,13,19,a(7),a(8),a(9),a(10)} shows two prime sums so far: 1 + 2 = 3 and 2 + 3 = 5.
%e A329416 a(7) = 23 as 23 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction; indeed, the 10-set {1,2,3,7,13,19,23,a(8),a(9),a(10)} shows only two prime sums so far, which are 1 + 2 = 3 and 2 + 3 = 5.
%e A329416 a(8) = 25 as 25 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction and producing two prime sums so far with the 10-set {1,2,3,7,13,19,23,25,a(9),a(10)}; etc.
