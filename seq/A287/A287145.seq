%N A287145 Smallest k such that both of the consecutive Woodall numbers A003261(k) and A003261(k+1) are divisible by A014662(n), the n-th prime p with even order of 2 mod p.
%C A287145 Keller proved that the occurrence of 2 consecutive Woodall numbers that are divisible by the same prime is restricted to primes p with even h(p), the order of 2 mod p, and that there are an infinity of such pairs.

%F A287145 a(n) = (h(p)/2 + 1)*p - 2, where p=A014662(n), and h(p) is the order of 2 modulo p (A014664).
%e A287145 11 is the 3rd prime p with even order of 2 mod p. A003261(k)=k*2^k-1 is divisible by 11 for k = 16,48,61,64,65,73,79,100,... The first occurrence of 2 consecutive numbers is 64 and 65, thus a(3) = 64.
