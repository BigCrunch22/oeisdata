%N A287611 Numbers which are twice an Ulam number but not the sum of two distinct Ulam numbers.
%C A287611 The sequence could also be described as numbers that have no representation as a sum of two distinct Ulam numbers, but have a "pseudo-representation" u + u, where u is an Ulam number.
%C A287611 a(10), if it exists, is larger than 5*10^7. - _Giovanni Resta_, May 31 2017
%F A287611 a(n) = A285882(n)/2. - _Giovanni Resta_, May 31 2017
%e A287611 204 is in the sequence since it can't be written as the sum of two distinct Ulam numbers, but 204 = 102 + 102, where 102 is an Ulam number.
