%N A287877 Start with n and repeatedly apply the powertrain map x -> A133500(x); a(n) is the fixed point that is eventually reached, or -1 if the trajectory never reaches a fixed point.
%C A287877 It is conjectured that a fixed point is always reached.
%C A287877 It is also conjectured that the only fixed points are the numbers 0 through 9, 2592, and 24547284284866560000000000 (see A135385).
