%N A287007 Number of simple (not necessarily connected) graphs on n vertices whose fractional chromatic number equals its (integer) chromatic number.
%C A287007 First differs from A198634 (weakly perfect graphs) at a(8).  The three 8-node graphs that have equal chromatic and fractional chromatic numbers but are not weakly perfect are the 4-antiprism graph and 50- and 84-Johnson solid skeleton graphs, all of which have clique number 3 but chromatic and fractional chromatic number 4.
