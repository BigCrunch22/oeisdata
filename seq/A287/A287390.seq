%N A287390 Nonprimes k that are a totative of only one primorial P in A002110.
%C A287390 From _Michael De Vlieger_, May 24 2017: (Start)
%C A287390 Let p_n# = A002110(n). Composite numbers p_n# < k < p_(n+1)# such that gcd(k,p_(n+1)) = 1 and whose minimum prime divisor is p_(n+2).
%C A287390 Subsequence of A285784.
%C A287390 The sequence can be thought of as an irregular triangle T(n,k) with the first terms appearing for n = 3. Row lengths of T(n,k) < A048863(n).
%C A287390 Many of the terms are semiprimes p_(n+2)*q with p_(n+2) < q < p_pi(p_(n+1)#), where pi(x) = A000720(x).
%C A287390 The smallest square in a(n) is 121 = 11^2. The smallest p^m for m = {2, 3, 4, 5} is {121, 2197, 130321, 643343}, which are {11^2, 13^3, 19^4, 23^5} respectively.

%e A287390 The numbers 121, 143, 187, and 209 are in the sequence because these are nonprimes greater than p_3# = 30 but less than p_4# = 210 with minimum prime divisor p_5 = 11.
%e A287390 The number 169 is not in the sequence because, although it falls between 30 and 210, it is coprime to 210 and to 2310 and thus is a totative of both these primorials.
