%N A287205 Starting with a(1)=1 and excluding the digit 0 in any term in the sequence, a(n)=smallest nonnegative integer not yet in the sequence such that a(n-1) and a(n) altogether have exactly one consecutive digit for at most one digit.
%C A287205 Note that upon removing commas, strings such as 111 and 1122 are not allowed. That is why 111 is not in the sequence and 99 is not followed by 112. The digit 0 is also not allowed as defined in the name.
