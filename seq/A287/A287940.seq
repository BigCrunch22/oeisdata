%N A287940 a(n) is the first odd prime greater than a(n-1) such that (a(1), ..., a(n)) forms a prime vector. a(1)=3, a(2)=5.
%C A287940 A prime vector of order n is an array of n distinct primes P = (p_1, p_2, ..., p_n) such that every sum of an odd number of consecutive elements is also prime. The weight of the prime vector is the sum of its elements. For full details see the Kamenetsky paper.
