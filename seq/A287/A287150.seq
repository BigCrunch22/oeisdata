%N A287150 Fairest turn sequence for 3 players where the probability of a win for a player on his turn approaches 0.
%C A287150 0, 1, and 2 are three archers of equal skill, but which have infinitesimally low chances of hitting a target. Still, they try: taking turns until one of them hits: 0 goes first, if 0 misses then 1 will try (these are the first two terms). Subsequent terms are found by giving a turn to the player who has the lowest probability of winning so far.
%C A287150 Joshua Cooper and Aaron Dutle showed that for two players this is the Thue-Morse sequence (A010060).
%C A287150 The following observations are made and verified to be true for the first 5000 terms:
%C A287150 - Every 3 terms completes a new round with each player going once per round.
%C A287150 - Every other round is the same as the last but in reverse order.
%C A287150 - The 48th-101st terms form a block of 54 terms which are repeated from then on.
