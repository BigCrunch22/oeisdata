%N A287372 0-limiting word of the mapping 00->1000, 10->000, starting with 00.
%C A287372 Iterates of the mapping, starting with 00:
%C A287372 00
%C A287372 1000
%C A287372 0001000
%C A287372 100000001000

%C A287372 10000000100000010000001000100000001000
%C A287372 The 0-limiting word is the limit of the n-th iterates even n.
%C A287372 Conjecture: the number of letters (0's and 1's) in the n-th iterate is given by A287439(n), for n >= 0.
%C A287372 From _Michel Dekking_, Mar 18 2018: (Start)
%C A287372 Here is a proof of the conjecture. We note first that the mapping SR: 00->1000, 10->000, is an algorithmic procedure given by StringReplace in Mathematica. This makes it hard to describe iterates of it. However, in this particular case there is a way to deal with this. Let
%C A287372        w1:=00, w2:=1000, w3:=0001000.
%C A287372 Then
%C A287372        SR(00) = w2, SR^2(00) = SR(w2) = w3, SR^3(00)=SR(w3) = w2w1w1w2.
%C A287372 Moreover, the 'isolated' 1's  do not occur at any border of w1, w2 or w3. It follows from this that SR acts context free on the semigroup generated by {w1,w2,w3}.
%C A287372 Let sigma be the morphism on the alphabet {1,2,3} given by
%C A287372     sigma(1) = 2,   sigma(2) = 3,   sigma(3) = 2112.
%C A287372 Then it is not hard to see that
%C A287372      delta(sigma^n(1)) = SR^n(00)   for n=0,1,2,...,
%C A287372 where delta is the 'decoration' morphism defined by
%C A287372     delta(1) = 00,  delta(2) =  1000,  delta(3) = 0001000.
%C A287372 From this it follows that
%C A287372       (a(n)) = delta(x),
%C A287372 where x = (x(n)) is the infinite word  with x(1)=3 fixed by sigma^2, i.e., sigma^2(x)=x.
%C A287372 Note that we also proved that the number of letters (0's and 1's) in the n-th iterate of SR is equal to the vector/matrix/vector product
%C A287372     (2,4,7) M^n (1,0,0)^T,
%C A287372 where (1,0,0)^T is the transpose of (1,0,0), and M is the incidence matrix of the morphism sigma, i.e., M equals
%C A287372     |0 0 2|
%C A287372     |1 0 2|
%C A287372     |0 1 0|.
%C A287372 The characteristic polynomial of M is equal to chi(u) = u^3-2u-2.
%C A287372 Thus the conjecture is proved by an application of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem:
%C A287372 M^3 = 2M + 2Id.
