%N A119464 Consider the standard game of Nim with 3 heaps and make a list of the losing positions (x,y,z) with x <= y <= z sorted by sum, ties broken by putting smallest value of x first, then y, then z; sequence gives x values.
%C A119464 Thanks to _Ray Chandler_ for help in clarifying the relation between this sorted list and the one in A080593.
%e A119464 The triples with sum <= 20 (this sequence is the first column) are:
%e A119464 0 0 0
