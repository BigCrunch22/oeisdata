%N A119495 Number of bi-secondary structures of size N.
%C A119495 A BiSecondary Structure(BSS) is a RNA graph that can be drawn without crossings using at most two halfplanes. The numbers displayed here were obtained by first generating all secondary structures of a given size and then by carefully counting possible completions on the second halfplane. Keep in mind that the simple shuffling of two secondary structures would yield many isomorphic RNA graphs.
%e A119495 Encoding the secondary structure on the first halfplane with '()', on the 2nd with '[]' and unpaired bases with '-'. For n=4, bss(n)=5:
%e A119495 .... (.). (..) .(.) ([)]
%e A119495 Notice that '[(])' must not be counted, as it is isomorphic to '([)]'.
