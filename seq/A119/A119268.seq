%N A119268 Number of infinite-dimensional partitions of n up to conjugacy.
%C A119268 Partitions are considered as generalized Ferrers diagrams; any permutation of the axes produces a conjugate. An infinite-dimensional partition thus has infinitely many conjugates. However, an infinite-dimensional partition of n always has a conjugate of dimension at most n-2, so this sequence is always finite.
%Y A119268 Cf. A119338, A118364, A118365.
