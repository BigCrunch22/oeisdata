%N A119870 Number of vertices of the root-n Waterman polyhedron.
%C A119870 The root-n Waterman polyhedron is the convex hull of the intersection of a closed ball of radius sqrt(2*n) with the lattice of sphere-center points of a cubic close packing. [Probably the f.c.c. lattice is intended here. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 09 2006]
%C A119870 The basic sphere center series of Waterman polyhedra is obtained by choosing a sphere center as the center of the closed ball. Other choices are possible. An example is given in A119874 ... A119878. For n in A055039 no lattice points are hit; the corresponding polyhedra are the same as for n-1.
%Y A119870 Cf. A119870, A119875 [vertices of void-centered Waterman polyhedron].
