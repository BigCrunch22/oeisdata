%N A119588 Numbers n such that the number of divisors of Fibonacci(n), tau(Fibonacci(n)), is not a perfect power of 2.
%C A119588 Has many terms in common with A023172 (41 below 1000), but neither is a subsequence of the other since 125 is not in this sequence.
%H A119588 Blair Kelly, <a href="http://mersennus.net/fibonacci/">Fibonacci and Lucas Factorizations</a>.
%F A119588 a(n) = {k: tau(Fibonacci(k)) != 2^i for all i}.
%e A119588 F(12) = 144 has 15 divisors: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 144}. Since 15 is not a power of 2, 12 is in the sequence.
%e A119588 F(24) = 46368 has 72 divisors. Since 72 is not a power of 2, 24 is in the sequence.
