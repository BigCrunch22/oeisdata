%N A119585 Triangle where n-th row is (1,2,3,...n) arranged first by number of divisors and then numerically (among those integers with the same number of divisors).
%e A119585 Looking at the 9th row, we want to arrange (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9). 1 has 1 divisor.
%e A119585 (2,3,5,7) each have 2 divisors. (4,9) each have 3 divisors. (6,8) each have 4 divisors. So the 9th row is (1)(2,3,5,7)(4,9)(6,8).
