%N A119451 Let S_n be the infinite sequence formed by starting with n and repeatedly reversing the digits and adding 16 to get the next term. Sequence gives number of steps for S_n to reach a cycle, or -1 if no cycle is ever reached.
%C A119451 It is conjectured that S_n always reaches a cycle.
%C A119451 There is one cycle of length 54 (least component is 34, all components have at most four digits, cf. A119454), 19 different cycles of length 90 with 4-digit components (least components are 1027 + 2*k for k = 0, ..., 18, cf. A119455), 444 different cycles of length 450 with 6-digit components, 3 different cycles of length 810 with 6-digit components (least components are 101007, 101011, 101015), 19 different cycles of length 1890 with 6-digit components (least components are 100027 + 2*k for k = 0, ..., 18) and at least 19 different cycles of length 19890 with 8-digit components (least components are 10000027 + 2*k for k = 0, ..., 18).

%Y A119451 S_1 is given in A118533. Records: A119452; where records occur: A119453. Cycles of length 54 and 90 are in A119454 and A119455.
