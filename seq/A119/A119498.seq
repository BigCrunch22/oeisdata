%N A119498 Consider the sign of A067276: determinant of n X n matrix containing the first n^2 primes in increasing order; then a(n) = 0 if negative and 1 if positive.
%C A119498 The determinant of A can never be 0 since there is an even prime in the mix.
%C A119498 Conjecture: This sequence never cycles.
%C A119498 Positions where the race between the zeros and the ones is tied: 2,4,16,34,36,38,40,42,46,66,78,80,82,84, ...,.
