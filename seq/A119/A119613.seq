%N A119613 Numbers n such that the difference between the largest distinct prime divisor and the smallest distinct prime divisor is a prime.
%C A119613 Obviously all terms are composite, because for primes the difference is zero. - _R. J. Mathar_, Feb 01 2023

%e A119613 If n = 10 then the prime divisors are 2 and 5 and the difference between these two is 3 which is also a prime. So 10 is in the sequence.
%e A119613 If n = 70 then the prime divisors are 2, 5 and 7 and the difference between the largest and the smallest distinct prime divisors is 5 which is also a prime. So 70 is in the sequence.
