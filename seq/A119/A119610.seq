%N A119610 Number of cases in which the first player is killed in a Russian roulette game where 5 players use a gun with n chambers and the number of bullets can be from 1 to n. Players do not rotate the cylinder after the game starts.
%C A119610 Denote by U(p,n,m) the number of the cases in which the first player is killed in a Russian roulette game where p players use a gun with n chambers and m bullets. They never rotate the cylinder after the game starts. The chambers can be represented by the list {1,2,...,n}.
%C A119610 Here we let p = 5 to produce the above sequence, but p can be an arbitrary positive integer. By letting p = 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 we can produce sequences A000975, A033138, A083593, A195904 and A117302, respectively.
%C A119610 The number of cases for each of the situations identified below by (0), (1), ..., (t), where t = floor((n-m)/p), can be calculated separately:
%C A119610 (0) The first player is killed when one bullet is in the first chamber and the remaining m-1 bullets are in chambers {2,3,...,n}. There are binomial(n-1,m-1) cases for this situation.
%C A119610 (1) The first player is killed when one bullet is in the (p+1)-th chamber and the rest of the bullets are in chambers {p+2,...,n}. There are binomial(n-p-1,m-1) cases for this situation.
%C A119610 ...
%C A119610 (t) The first player is killed when one bullet is in the (p*t+1)-th chamber and the remaining bullets are in chambers {p*t+2,...,n}. There are binomial(n-p*t-1,m-1) cases for this situation.
%C A119610 Therefore U(p,n,m) = Sum_{z=0..t} binomial(n-p*z-1,m-1), where t = floor((n-m)/p). Let A(p,n) be the number of the cases in which the first player is killed when p players use a gun with n chambers and the number of bullets can be from 1 to n. Then A(p,n) = Sum_{m=1..n} U(p,n,m).

%F A119610 a(n) = floor(2^(n+4)/31), which is obtained by letting p=5 in a_p(n) = (2^(n + p-1) - 2^((n-1) mod p))/(2^p - 1).

%e A119610 If the number of chambers is 3, then the number of the bullets can be 1, 2, or 3. The first player is killed when one bullet is in the first chamber, and the remaining bullets are in the second and third chambers. The only cases are {{1, 0, 0}, {1, 1, 0}, {1, 0, 1}, {1, 1, 1}}, where we denote by 1 a chamber that contains a bullet. Therefore a(3) = 4.
