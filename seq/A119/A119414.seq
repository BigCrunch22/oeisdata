%N A119414 Number of triangle-free graphs g on n nodes for which the chromatic number chi(g) equals r(g) = ceiling((Delta(g) + 1 + omega(g))/2).
%C A119414 Here Delta(g) is the maximum node degree of g and omega(g) is the clique number of g (=2 for triangle-free graphs). r(g) is conjectured by Reed to be an upper bound for chi(g) for all graphs.
%C A119414 The sequence is of interest as a measure of how frequently the bound is attained. For example, for n=14 there are 467871369 triangle-free graphs.
