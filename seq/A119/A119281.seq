%N A119281 Number of counting rods to represent n in the ancient Chinese rod numeral system.
%C A119281 Contrast with A092196, the number of letters to represent n in ancient Roman numerals. Negative numbers were represented by the same number of rods but usually of a different color (usually black rods with red rods for positive numbers). It's unclear to me whether 0 itself was ever formally considered represented by the absence of all counting rods, but it does seem reasonable that a(0)=0 from the example below.

%F A119281 a(n) = a(-n) = A007953(n) - 4*A102677(n) = A092196(n) + 4*(number of 5s in n).
%e A119281 a(105) = 6 because 105 was represented on a counting board by placing one counting rod in the compartment for hundreds, no rods where those representing tens were normally placed and five rods in the units compartment.
