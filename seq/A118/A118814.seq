%N A118814 Number of 'tree-like curves' with n intersection points.
%C A118814 The objects being enumerated are a subset of those enumerated by A008983. The restriction involved is that the Gauss diagram (or chord diagram) has no intersecting chords. The first 3 entries are the same as A008983 because, for less than 3 intersection points, all curves are tree-like. For 3 intersection points there are only 2 curves that are not tree-like. They appear as the 4th and 15th entries in the table for n=3, on page 14 of Arnold's book. (For all I know, this sequence may be equal to one of the others already in the database with the same initial terms.)
