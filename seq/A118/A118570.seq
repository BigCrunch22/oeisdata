%N A118570 Very lucky numbers : apply the sieve to obtain the lucky numbers (A000959) on the lucky numbers themselves.
%C A118570 Start with the lucky numbers (A000959). After the initial 1, the first number is 3. So delete every 3rd number, leaving 1 3 9 13 ...; the next number remaining is 9, so delete every 9nd number, leaving 1 3 9 13 21 25 33 ...; now delete every 13th number, then delete every 21st number; etc. It would be interesting to know the density of those numbers.
%Y A118570 Cf. A000959.
