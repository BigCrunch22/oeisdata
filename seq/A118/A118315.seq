%N A118315 a(1) = 1. a(2n) = smallest positive integer not occurring among the earlier terms of the sequence. a(2n+1) = the a(n)th positive integer among those positive integers not occurring earlier in the sequence.
%C A118315 Sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.
%H A118315 Ivan Neretin, <a href="/A118315/b118315.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..10000</a>
%e A118315 For a(9) we want the a(4)th = 4th positive integer among those not equal to any of the first 8 terms of the sequence (those positive integers not equal to 1,2,3,4,6,5,9, or 7). Among those positive integers not equal to any the first 8 terms (which is the sequence 8,10,11,12,13...), 12 is the 4th. So a(9) = 12.
%e A118315 Now for a(10) we want the smallest positive integer that does not occur among the first 9 terms of the sequence. So a(10) = 8.
