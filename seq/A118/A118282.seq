%N A118282 Conjectured largest number that is not the sum of three generalized n-gonal numbers, or -1 if there is no largest number.
%C A118282 Extensive calculations show that if a(n)>=0, then every number greater than a(n) can be represented as the sum of three generalized n-gonal numbers. a(n)=0 for n=3 and 6 because generalized triangular and generalized hexagonal numbers are the same a triangular numbers and every number can be written as the sum of three triangular numbers. When n is a multiple of 4, there is an infinite set of numbers not representable. For n=14, there appears to be a sparse, but infinite, set of numbers not representable. See A118283 for the number of numbers not representable.
