%N A118877 Determinant of n-th continuous block of 4 consecutive composites.
%C A118877 Composites analog of A117301 Determinants of 2 X 2 matrices of continuous blocks of 4 consecutive primes. See also: A118780 Determinants of 2 X 2 matrices of continuous blocks of 4 consecutive semiprimes. The terminology "continuous" is used to distinguish from "discrete" which would be (in this composites case) block 1: 4, 6, 8, 9; block 2: 10, 12, 14, 15 and so forth. It is not until a(12) that we break the pattern of a(2n)=a(2n-1); there seem to be strangely many such pairs of two identical values. a(12) is also the first odd value in the sequence and the first prime.
