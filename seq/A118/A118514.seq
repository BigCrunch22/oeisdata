%N A118514 Define sequence S_n by: initial term = n, reverse digits and add 2 to get next term. It is conjectured that S_n always reaches a cycle. Sequence gives number of steps for S_n to reach a cycle.
%C A118514 Initial cycles have length 81 or 90.
%C A118514 There is one cycle of length 81 (least component is 3, all components have at most three digits, cf. A117521), 22 cycles of length 90 with 4-digit components (least components are 1013 + 2*k for k = 0, ..., 21, cf. A120214) and one cycle of length 45 with 4-digit components (least component is 1057, cf. A120215). Furthermore there are 22 cycles of length 1890 (least components are 100013 + 2*k for k = 0, ..., 21, cf. A120216), one cycle of length 945 (least component is 100057, cf. A120217) and 225 cycles of length 900 (least components are 100103 + 2*k for k = 0, ..., 224, cf. A120218), all having 6-digit components. It is conjectured that there are also cycles of increasing length with 8-, 10-, 12-, ... digit components. - _Klaus Brockhaus_, Jun 10 2006
