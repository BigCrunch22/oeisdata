%N A118514 Define sequence S_n by: initial term = n, reverse digits and add 2 to get next term. It is conjectured that S_n always reaches a cycle. Sequence gives number of steps for S_n to reach a cycle.
%C A118514 Initial cycles have length 81 or 90.
%C A118514 There is one cycle of length 81 (least component is 3, all components have at most three digits, cf. A117521), 22 cycles of length 90 with 4-digit components (least components are 1013 + 2*k for k = 0, ..., 21, cf. A120214) and one cycle of length 45 with 4-digit components (least component is 1057, cf. A120215). Furthermore there are 22 cycles of length 1890 (least components are 100013 + 2*k for k = 0, ..., 21, cf. A120216), one cycle of length 945 (least component is 100057, cf. A120217) and 225 cycles of length 900 (least components are 100103 + 2*k for k = 0, ..., 224, cf. A120218), all having 6-digit components. It is conjectured that there are also cycles of increasing length with 8-, 10-, 12-, ... digit components. - _Klaus Brockhaus_, Jun 10 2006
%C A118514 From _Michael S. Branicky_, May 11 2023: (Start)
%C A118514 There are 22 cycles of length 19890 (least components are 10000013 + 2*k for k = 0, ..., 21), one cycle of length 9945 (least component 10000057), 225 cycles of length 18900 (least components are 10000103 + 2*k for k = 0, ..., 224) and 2250 cycles of length 9000 (least components are 10001003 + 2*k for k = 0, ..., 2249), all having 8-digit components.
%C A118514 These patterns continue.  Specifically, there is one cycle of length 10^(n/2) - 55 (least component 10^(n-1) + 57), and there are 22 cycles of length 2*(10^(n/2) - 55) (least components 10^(n-1) + 13 + 2*k for k = 0, ..., 21), each for n = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16. (End)
