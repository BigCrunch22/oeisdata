%N A118317 a(2n-1)= smallest positive integer not occurring among the earlier terms of the sequence. a(2n) = the a(n)th positive integer among those positive integers not occurring earlier in the sequence.
%C A118317 Sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A118317 For a(8) we want the a(4)th = 5th positive integer among those not equal to any of the first 7 terms of the sequence (those positive integers not equal to 1,2,3,5,4,8, or 6). Among those positive integers not equal to any the first 7 terms (which is the sequence 7,9,10,11,12,13...), 12 is the 5th. So a(8) = 12.
%e A118317 Now for a(9) we want the smallest positive integer that does not occur among the first 8 terms of the sequence. So a(9) = 7.
