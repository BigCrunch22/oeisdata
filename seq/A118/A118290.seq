%N A118290 a(1) = 1. a(n) = number of terms among the sequence's first (n-1) terms which are divisible by the smallest prime dividing a(n-1), or which are divisible by 1 if a(n-1)= 1.
%C A118290 If a(n-1) = 1, then a(n) = n-1, obviously.

%e A118290 a(13)= 12. So a(14) = the number of terms among the first 13 terms which are divisible by the lowest prime dividing 12 (which is 2).
%e A118290 a(3)=2, a(5)=4, a(6)=2, a(9)=8, a(10)=4 and a(13) = 12 are the six terms each divisible by 2, so a(14) = 6.
