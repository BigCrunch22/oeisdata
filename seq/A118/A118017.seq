%N A118017 Largest denominators in even Egyptian fraction representation of 1.
%C A118017 An Egyptian Fraction representation of a rational number a/b is a list of distinct unit fractions with sum a/b. We will call it an even Egyptian Fraction representation if only even integers are used as denominators. The n-th term of this sequence gives the largest denominators that appear in an Egyptian Fraction Representation of one with length n+3. For instance, 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/12 gives a 4-term even representation of one, which is the shortest possible Egyptian even fraction representation of one.
%C A118017 This sequence can be derived from the Sylvester sequence (A000058). If s(n) represents the Sylvester sequence, s(n)-1 is the largest denominator appearing in an n term Egyptian fraction representation of 1. There is a one-to-one correspondence between k-term representations and (k+1)-term even representation for k<12. An even representation has to have at least 4 terms, thus a(1) is related to s(3). a(1) = 2*(s(3) - 1), etc.
%C A118017 Excluding the first two terms of the Pythagorean spiral sequence (A053631) yields this sequence.

%F A118017 a(n+1) = 1/2*a(n)^2 + a(n).
%e A118017 a(2) = 1/2*12^2 + 12 so a(2) = 84.
