%N A118522 Define sequence S_n by: initial term = n, reverse digits and add 3 to get next term. It is conjectured that S_n always reaches a cycle. Sequence gives number of steps for S_n to reach a cycle.
%C A118522 Initial cycles have length 3 or 6.
%C A118522 From _Lars Blomberg_, Jan 15 2018: (Start)
%C A118522 For n < 10^8, the only cycles found are the following:
%C A118522   [4,7,10]
%C A118522   [18,84,51]
%C A118522   [29,95,62]
%C A118522   [11,14,44,47,77,80]
%C A118522   [12,24,45,57,78,90]
%C A118522   [15,54,48,87,81,21]
%C A118522   [16,64,49,97,82,31]
%C A118522   [19,94,52,28,85,61]
%C A118522   [22,25,55,58,88,91]
%C A118522   [26,65,59,98,92,32]
%C A118522 The union of all of them has 51 terms (= 3*3 + 7*6): [4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 31, 32, 44, 45, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 54, 55, 57, 58, 59, 61, 62, 64, 65, 77, 78, 80, 81, 82, 84, 85, 87, 88, 90, 91, 92, 94, 95, 97, 98] (End)
