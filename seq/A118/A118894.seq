%N A118894 Numbers m such that the Pell equation x^2-m*y^2=1 has fundamental solution with x even.
%C A118894 Numbers m such that A002350(m) is even. These m can be used to generate consecutive odd powerful numbers, as in A076445. As shown by Lang, the solution of Pell's equation is greatly simplified by Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind T(n,x), which is illustrated in A001075 for the case m=3. In that case, the solutions are x=T(n,2), for integer n>0. For any m in this sequence, let E(k)=T(m+2mk,A002350(m)). Then E(k)-1 and E(k)+1 are consecutive odd powerful numbers for k=0,1,2,...
