%N A118878 Let T(S,Q) be the sequence obtaining by starting with S and repeatedly reversing the digits and adding Q to get the next term. a(n) is the number of steps for T(n,5) to reach a cycle, or -1 if no cycle is ever reached.
%C A118878 Is a(n) ever -1? If so then n > 10000.
%C A118878 The cycle has length 207 for S <= 1015, but for S = 1016 it has length 36 (see A118879).
