%N A118198 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of partitions of n having k parts equal to the size of the Durfee square (0<=k<=n).
%C A118198 Row sums yield the partition numbers (A000041). T(n,0)=A118199(n)
%F A118198 G.f.=G(t,x)=1+sum(x^(k^2)*P(k-1)sum(t^(k-j)*x^j*P(j), j=0..k)/(1-tx^k), k=1..infinity), where P(m)=1/product(1-x^i,i=1..m).
%e A118198 T(4,0)=1 because [4] has Durfee square of size 1 and there is no part equal to 1; T(4,1)=1 because [3,1] has Durfee square of size 1 and there is 1 part equal to 1; T(4,2)=2 because [2,2] has Durfee square of size 2 and there are 2 parts equal to 2 and [2,1,1] has Durfee square of size 1 and there are 2 parts equal to 1; T(4,3)=0 because obviously no partition of 4 can have exactly 3 parts of the same size; T(4,4)=1 because [1,1,1,1] has Durfee square of size 1 and there are 4 parts equal to 1.
