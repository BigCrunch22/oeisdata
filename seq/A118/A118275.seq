%N A118275 a(0) = 1. a(n) is the number of times the binary representation of a(n-1) appears in the concatenated string of the terms a(0) through a(n-1) written in binary. (The concatenated string is written from left to right and each binary integer is written so the most significant 1 is on the left.)
%C A118275 Sequence A118274 is the string of terms of this sequence written in binary and concatenated.

%e A118275 The string of concatenated binary representations of a(0) through a(7) is
%e A118275 11101100111011. Now a(7)= 3, which is 11 in binary. '11' occurs 6 times in the string (with, in this case, some binary digits in the string being used more than once). (The six '11's occur at {with position 1 on the left} positions 1, 2, 5, 9, 10 and 13.) So a(8) = 6. (And '1,1,0' is appended to the end of sequence A118274.)
