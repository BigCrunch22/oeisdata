%N A118268 a(0)= A118269(0) = 1. Place A118269(n) written in binary to end of sequence A118268 (with each binary digit entered separately and where '0' is appended to sequence if A118269(n) = 0). A118269(n) is number of times n written in binary occurs among the earlier terms (before A118269(n) in binary is added) of this sequence concatenated.

%e A118268 21 in binary is 10101. This sequence up to just before the binary A118269(21) is appended is (after concatenation) 110101100011110101001. 10101 occurs twice in this concatenated string. So A118269(21) is 2 and {1,0} (representing a binary 2) is appended to the end of this sequence.
