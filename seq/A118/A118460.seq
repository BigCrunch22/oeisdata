%N A118460 a(n) is the smallest positive integer which does not occur earlier in the sequence such that gcd(n(n+1)/2, a(n)) = 1.
%C A118460 Sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.
%H A118460 Diana Mecum, <a href="/A118460/b118460.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..500</a>
%e A118460 Of the positive integers (6,7,8,...) not occurring among the first 5 terms of the sequence, 8 is the lowest coprime to 6*7/2 = 21. So a(6) = 8. a(6) is not 6 or 7 because gcd(6,21) > 1 and gcd(7,21) > 1.
