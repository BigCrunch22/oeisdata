%N A118641 Number of nonisomorphic finite non-associative, invertible loops of order n.
%C A118641 These are non-associative loops in which every element has a unique inverse and it includes IP, Moufang and Bol loops [Cawagas]. The data were generated and checked by a supercomputer of 48 Pentium II 400 processors, specially built for automated reasoning, in about three days. In general, a loop is a quasigroup with an identity element e such that xe = x and ex = x for any x in the quasigroup. All groups are loops. A quasigroup is a groupoid G such that for all a and b in G, there exist unique c and d in G such that ac = b and da = b. Hence a quasigroup is not required to have an identity element, nor be associative. Equivalently, one can state that quasigroups are precisely groupoids whose multiplication tables are Latin squares (possibly empty).
