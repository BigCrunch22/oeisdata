%N A234923 Array w(n,h), in which row n shows the weights, as defined in Comments, of the distinct-parts partitions of n, arranged in Mathematica order.
%C A234923 The weight of a partition P = x (1)+ x(2)+...+x(k) of n is given at A234094 as k*x(1) + (k-1)*x(2) + ... + x(k), which is the number of steps needed to make P from the sum 1+1+...+1 = n by moving dividers into the sum; see the Example section.
%F A234923 w(n,h) = dot product of (partition # h of n) and (k, k-1, ..., 1), where k = length of (partition # h of n).
%e A234923 Represent 1+1+1+1+1 as _1_1_1_1_1_. The partition 3+2+1 matches the placement of dividers d indicated by _1 _1_1d1_1_d_1_d. To place the 1st d takes 3 steps (starting at the 1st '_'); to place the 2nd d takes 3+2 steps (starting at the 1st '_'); to place the 3rd d takes 3+2+1 steps. The total number of steps is 3+5+6 = 14, the 4th number in row 4 because 3+2+1 is the 4th distinct-parts partition of 6 in Mathematica ordering. The first 9 rows:
