%N A234503 Number of ways to write n = k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that 3^(phi(k)/2 + phi(m)/12) + 2 is prime, where phi(.) is Euler's totient function.
%C A234503 It might seem that a(n) > 0 for all n > 14, but a(43905) = 0. If a(n) > 0 infinitely often, then there are infinitely many primes of the form 3^m + 2.
%C A234503 Similarly, it might seem that for n > 26 there is a positive integer k < n such that m = phi(k)/2 + phi(n-k)/12 is an integer with 3^m - 2 prime, but n = 41213 is a counterexample.

%e A234503 a(15) = 1 since 15 = 1 + 14 with 3^(phi(1)/2 + phi(14)/12) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5 prime.
%e A234503 a(23) = 1 since 23 = 10 + 13 with 3^(phi(10)/2 + phi(13)/12) + 2 = 3^3 + 2 = 29 prime.
%e A234503 a(24) = 1 since 24 = 3 + 21 with 3^(phi(3)/2 + phi(21)/12) + 2 = 3^2 + 2 = 11 prime.
%e A234503 a(37) = 1 since 37 = 9 + 28 with 3^(phi(9)/2 + phi(28)/12) + 2 = 3^4 + 2 = 83 prime.
