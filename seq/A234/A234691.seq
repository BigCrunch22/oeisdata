%N A234691 Decimal value of the bitmap of active segments in 7-segment display of the number n, variant 1: bits 0-6 refer to segments from top to bottom, left to right.
%C A234691 The bits 0-6 are assigned to the segments as follows: top (bit 0), upper left, upper right, middle, lower left, lower right, bottom (bit 6). Other conventions are common in engineering (as well for the segment-to-bit correspondence as for the glyphs), see sequence A234692 (the so-called ABCDEF coding), Wikipedia and the Example for a(7).
%C A234691 For n > 9, the decimal representation of n is encoded using a group of 7 bits for each digit, e.g., a(10) = a(1)*2^7 + a(0).
%C A234691 The sequence could have been extended differently to indices > 9, for example, by coding 7-segment representations of upper- and/or lowercase letters, as used for hexadecimal and base-64 representation.
%C A234691 The Hamming weight A000120 of the terms of this sequence yields the count of lit segments, A010371(n) = A000120(A234691(n)) = A000120(A234692(n)). For that sequence, 4 other variants are in the OEIS, depending on the number of segments used to represent digits 6, 7 and 9: A063720 (6', 7', 9'), A277116 (7', 9'), A074458 (9') and A006942 (7'), where x' means that the "sans serif" variant (one segment less than here) is used for digit x. - _M.

%F A234691 a(n) = a(n mod 10) + a(floor(n/10))*2^7 for n > 9. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jun 17 2020
%e A234691 The digits are assumed to be rendered as follows:
%e A234691    _     _  _       _   _   _   _   _
%e A234691   | | |  _| _| |_| |_  |_  | | |_| |_|
%e A234691   |_| | |_  _|   |  _| |_|   | |_|  _|
%e A234691 For example, a(7) = 39 = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + 2^5, because the nonzero bits are
%e A234691    _  : bit 0,
%e A234691   | | : bits 1+2,
%e A234691     | : bit 5,
%e A234691 while bits 3 (central '-'), 4 (lower left '|') and 6 (bottom '_') remain 0.
%e A234691 For the digit '7', the "sans serif" representation (without the upper left '|') is also very common; it would correspond to a(7) = 37. Similarly, digits 6 and 9 are sometimes represented without the top resp. bottom bar, see comments.
