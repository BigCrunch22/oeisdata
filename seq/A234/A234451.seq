%N A234451 Number of ways to write n = k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that 2^(phi(k)/2 + phi(m)/6) + 3 is prime, where phi(.) is Euler's totient function.
%C A234451 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 9. Also, any integer n > 13 can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that 2^(phi(k)/2 + phi(m)/6) - 3 is prime.
%C A234451 (ii) Each integer n > 25 can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that 3*2^(phi(k)/2 + phi(m)/8) + 1 (or 3*2^(phi(k)/2 + phi(m)/12) + 1 when n > 38) is prime. Also, any integer n > 14 can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that 3*2^(phi(k)/2 + phi(m)/12) - 1 is prime.
%C A234451 This conjecture implies that there are infinitely many primes in any of the four forms 2^n + 3, 2^n - 3, 3*2^n + 1, 3*2^n - 1.
%C A234451 We have verified the conjecture for n up to 50000.
