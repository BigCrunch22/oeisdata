%N A234954 Number of totally symmetric 6-dimensional partitions of n.
%C A234954 We can think of the points of a totally symmetric partition of n, say p, as occurring in classes, where two points are in the same class iff one point is a given by a permutation of the coordinates of the other.  Call the number of distinct points in a class the size of that class.
%C A234954 The only classes of points in a 6-dimensional totally symmetric partition, p, of n, which do not have class size divisible by 3 are composed of points of the form (x,x,x,x,x,x) or (x,x,x,y,y,y) (or any permutation of these coordinates).  The former has class size 1, the latter, class size 20.
%C A234954 For n=2 mod 3, a(n)=0 for the first 232 terms.  Indeed, suppose n<233 and n=2 mod 3 and p partitions n in 6 dimensions.  If j is the number of points of the form (x,x,x,x,x,x) in p, and k is the number of points of the form (x,x,x,y,y,y) in p, then we must have j+2k = 2 mod 3.  Now j>0 because (1,1,1,1,1,1) must be a point of p.  If j=1, we have k=2 mod 3, so that k>=2.  In this case, the minimum size of n occurs when k=2 and the two points of the form (x,x,x,y,y,y) are (2,2,2,1,1,1) and (3,3,3,1,1,1). In this case, n=233.  If j=2, we have k=0 mod 3.  But since j=2,(2,2,2,2,2,2) is a point of p.  Thus, so is(2,2,2,1,1,1). Hence, k>0, whence k>=4. In particular, k>=2 so that n>233.  If j>=3, then (3,3,3,3,3,3) is a point of p, in which case n>729=3^6.
%C A234954 In fact the first term of the sequence with n=2 mod 3, and which is nonzero is a(233) = 1
