%e A234593 Here is the sequence with the multiples of 5 set off by asterisks:
%e A234593 1, *5*, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, *50*, 8, 51, *10*, 52, 9, 11, *500*, 12, 13, 53, 14, *20*, 16, 54, 17, 18, 19, 21, *30*, 22, 23, ...
%e A234593 The numbers of terms between the multiples of 5 is 1, 5, 2, 3, 4, ..., which gives the sequence.
%e A234593 Here is the sequence with the 5's digits set off by asterisks:
%e A234593 1, *5*, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, *5*0, 8, *5*1, 10, *5*2, 9, 11, *5*00, 12, 13, *5*3, 14, 20, 16, *5*4, 17, 18, 19, 21, 30, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 40, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 1*5*1, 44, ...
%e A234593 The numbers of digits between the 5's is again the sequence.
