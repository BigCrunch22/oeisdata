%N A234346 Primes of the form 3^k + 3^m - 1, where k and m are positive integers.
%C A234346 Clearly, all terms are congruent to 5 modulo 6.
%C A234346 By a conjecture in A234337 or A234347, this sequence should have infinitely many terms.
%C A234346 Conjecture: For any integer a > 1, there are infinitely many primes of the form a^k + a^m - 1, where k and m are positive integers.
