%N A234337 a(n) = |{0 < k < n - 2: 4^k + 2^{phi(n-k)} - 1 is prime}|, where phi(.) is Euler's totient function.
%C A234337 Conjecture: Let a be 2 or 3 or 4. If n > 3, then a^k + a^{phi(n-k)/2} - 1 is prime for some 0 < k < n - 2.
%C A234337 This conjecture for a = 4 implies that there are infinitely many terms of the sequence A234310. The conjecture for a = 3 implies that there are infinitely many primes of the form 3^k + 3^m - 1 (cf. A234346), where k and m are positive integers.

%e A234337 a(4) = 1 since 4^1 + 2^{phi(3)} - 1 = 7 is prime.
%e A234337 a(5) = 2 since 4^1 + 2^{phi(4)} - 1 = 7 and 4^2 + 2^{phi(3)} - 1 = 19 are both prime.
