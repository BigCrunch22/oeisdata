%N A234534 Terms of the cycles reached after iterations of numerator(sigma(n)/n) = A017665(n).
%C A234534 If all integers were in A014567, then this sequence would not exist and we would be looking at A216200; but some are in A069059, allowing the trajectories of A017665 to go down.
%C A234534 The term of the sequence correspond to the 5 cycles: [1], [15, 8], [448, 127, 128, 255, 144, 403], [1023, 512], [47360, 29127].
%C A234534 Are there some starting x's whose fate will remain unknown, like 276 for A098007?
%C A234534 Are there other cycles to be found?
%C A234534 No other cycles found with largest member less than 10^9.
%C A234534 There are no other cycles with the smallest member < 10^11. All numbers < 10^11 reach one of the five known cycles. - _Donovan Johnson_, Jan 07 2014
%e A234534 Obviously 1 is a fixed point for A017665, so 1 is in the sequence.
%e A234534 A017665(8) = 15 and A017665(15) = 8, so both 8 and 15 are in the sequence.
%o A234534 (PARI) iscycle(v, nextn) = {for (i=1, #v, if (v[i] == nextn, return (1););); return (0);}
%o A234534 fcycle(n, known) = {v = vector(1); v[1] = n; first = n; while ((nextn = numerator(sigma(n)/n)) <= first, if (vecsearch(known, nextn), return([])); if (iscycle(v, nextn), return (v)); v = concat(v, nextn); n = nextn;); return ([]);}
%o A234534 fcycles(na, nb) = {known = []; known = [1, 8, 127, 512, 29127]; for (n = na, nb, v = fcycle(n, known); if (#v, print(v, ", "); return();););} \\ use empty vector for known to search for cycles from start; when a new cycle is found, insert its smallest term to vector known.
