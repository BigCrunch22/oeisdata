%N A234309 a(n) = |{2 < k <= n/2: 2^{phi(k)} + 2^{phi(n-k)} - 1 is prime}|, where phi(.) is Euler's totient function.
%C A234309 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 5.
%C A234309 (ii) For any integer n > 1, 2^k +2^{phi(n-k)} - 1 is prime for some 0 < k < n, and 2^{sigma(j)} + 2^{phi(n-j)} - 1 is prime for some 0 < j < n, where sigma(j) is the sum of all positive divisors of j.
%C A234309 As phi(k) is even for any k > 2, part (i) of the conjecture implies that there are infinitely many primes of the form 4^a + 4^b - 1 with a and b positive integers (cf. A234310). Note that any Mersenne prime greater than 3 has the form 2^{2a+1} - 1 = 4^a + 4^a - 1.

%e A234309 a(6) = 1 since 2^{phi(3)} + 2^{phi(3)} - 1 = 2^2 + 2^2 - 1 = 7 is prime.
%e A234309 a(7) = 1 since 2^{phi(3)} + 2^{phi(4)} - 1 = 2^2 + 2^2 - 1 = 7 is prime.
%e A234309 a(8) = 2 since 2^{phi(3)} + 2^{phi(5)} - 1 = 2^2 + 2^4 - 1 = 19 and 2^{phi(4)} + 2^{phi(4)} - 1 = 2^2 + 2^2 - 1 = 7 are both prime.
