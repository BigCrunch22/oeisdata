%N A234968 Number of totally symmetric partitions of n of any dimension.
%C A234968 a(n) is the sum over d from 1 to infinity of the number of totally symmetric d-dimensional Ferrers diagrams with n nodes.
%C A234968 A d-dimensional Ferrers diagram is totally symmetric if and only if whenever X=(x1,x2,...,xd) is a node, then so are all nodes which can be specified by permuting the coordinates of X.
%C A234968 Since a(1)=oo, the sequence above begins on n=2. All other terms are finite.

%e A234968 a(1)=oo because for each dimension, d, the trivial Ferrers diagram given by the single node (1,1,1,...,1) is a totally symmetric d-dimensional partition of 1.
%e A234968 For n > 2, a(n) < oo. This means that for n > 2, there are at most a finite number of dimensions, d, for which the number of totally symmetric d-dimensional partitions of n is nonzero (and that for any dimension, d, there are at most a finite number of totally symmetric d-dimensional partitions of n).
%e A234968 a(2)=1. Indeed the only totally symmetric partition of 2 occurs in dimension 1. The corresponding 1-dimensional totally symmetric Ferrers diagram (TS FD) is given by the following two nodes (specified by the 1-dimensional coordinates): (2) and (1).
%e A234968 a(8)=5.
%e A234968 There is one 1-dimensional TS FD of 8:
%e A234968   {(8),(7),(6),(5),(4),(3),(2),(1)}
%e A234968 There are two 2-dimensional TS FD of 8:
%e A234968   {(3,2),(2,3),(3,1),(2,2),(1,3),(2,1),(1,2),(1,1)} and
%e A234968   {(4,1),(1,4),(3,1),(2,2),(1,3),(2,1),(1,2),(1,1)}
%e A234968 There is one 3-dimensional TS FD of 8:
%e A234968   {(2,2,2),(2,2,1),(2,1,2),(1,2,2),(2,1,1),(1,2,1),(1,1,2),(1,1,1)}
%e A234968 There is one 7-dimensional TS FD of 8:
%e A234968   {(2,1,1,1,1,1,1),(1,2,1,1,1,1,1),(1,1,2,1,1,1,1),(1,1,1,2,1,1,1),(1,1,1,1,2,1,1),(1,1,1,1,1,2,1),(1,1,1,1,1,1,2),(1,1,1,1,1,1,1)}
%e A234968 There are no TS FD of 8 of any other dimension. Hence a(8)=1+2+1+1=5.
%e A234968 a(72)=573
%e A234968 The TS FD of 72 are:
%e A234968   Dim 1: 1
%e A234968   Dim 2: 471
%e A234968   Dim 3: 85
%e A234968   Dim 4: 11
%e A234968   Dim 5: 3
%e A234968   Dim 6: 1
%e A234968   Dim 71: 1
%e A234968 (For n > 1) there is always exactly 1 TS FD of dimension 1 and 1 TS FD of dimension n-1. If n > 2, these two dimensions are not equal, so there must be at least two TS FD. Hence a(n) >= 2 for n > 2.
%Y A234968 The number of TS FD of dimensions 2, 3, and 4 are given by sequences A000700, A048141, and A097516 respectively.
