%N A234514 Number of ways to write n = k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that p = k + phi(m)/2 and q(p) + 1 are both prime, where phi(.) is Euler's totient function, and q(.) is the strict partition function (A000009).
%C A234514 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 12.
%C A234514 (ii) For any integer n > 4, there is a prime p < n - 2 such that q(p + phi(n-p)/2) + 1 is prime.
%C A234514 Clearly, part (i) of the conjecture implies that there are infinitely many primes p with q(p) + 1 prime (cf. A234530).
%C A234514 We have verified part (i) for n up to 10^5.
