%N A234974 Expected lengths of random walks along the edges of a Platonic solid (in the order cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron) from one vertex to an opposing one.
%C A234974 For all Platonic solids (excluding the tetrahedron), the expected number of steps of a random walk from one vertex to its opposite vertex is indeed an integer.
