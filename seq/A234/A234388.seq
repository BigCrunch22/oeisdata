%N A234388 Primes of the form 2^k*(2^{phi(m)} - 1) + 1, where k and m are positive integers, and phi(.) is Euler's totient function.
%C A234388 Conjecture: (i) Any integer n > 1 can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that 2^k*(2^{phi(m)} - 1) + 1 is prime.
%C A234388 (ii) Each integer n > 2 can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that 2^k*(2^{phi(m)} - 1) - 1 is prime.
%C A234388 Part (i) of the conjecture implies that this sequence has infinitely many terms. See also A234399.
%C A234388 Note that the sequence contains all Fermat primes and Mersenne primes since 2^k + 1 = 2^k*(2^{phi(1)} - 1) + 1 and 2^p - 1 = 2*(2^{phi(p)} - 1) + 1, where k is a positive integer and p is a prime.

%e A234388 a(1) = 3 since 2*(2^{phi(1)} - 1) + 1 = 3 is prime.
%e A234388 a(2) = 5 since 2^2*(2^{phi(1)} - 1) + 1 = 5 is prime.
%e A234388 a(3) = 7 since 2*(2^{phi(3)} - 1) + 1 = 7 is prime.
