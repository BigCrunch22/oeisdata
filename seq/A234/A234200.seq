%N A234200 a(n) = |{0 < k < n/2: k*phi(n-k) - 1 and k*phi(n-k) + 1 are both prime}|, where phi(.) is Euler's totient function.
%C A234200 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 4.
%C A234200 (ii) If n > 3 is different from 9 and 29, then k*sigma(n-k) - 1 and k*sigma(n-k) + 1 are both prime for some 0 < k < n.
%C A234200 Obviously, either of the two parts implies the twin prime conjecture. We have verified part (i) for n up to 10^8.
