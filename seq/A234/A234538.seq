%N A234538 (Number of positive digits of n written in base 3) modulo 3.
%C A234538 Since A000120 is the number of positive digits of n written in binary, this sequence is a formal ternary analog of the Thue-Morse sequence A010060. However, one cannot name it a "ternary version of A010060" like the known versions A053838, A071858, A036577-A036586, since it is not "cubefree"; i.e., it contains the same 3 consecutive terms, and there is not a known morphism for which it is a fixed point.
