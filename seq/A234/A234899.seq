%N A234899 Record holders for lengths of ever-decreasing aliquot sequences.
%C A234899 If one looks at the lengths of uninterrupted decreasing aliquot sequences, the converse of A081705, one gets a sequence similar to A098008, except for perfect or abundant numbers, but also for numbers that encounter a perfect or abundant numbers in this process.
%C A234899 The current sequence lists the deficient numbers yielding uninterrupted decreasing aliquot sequences that are longer than any previous ones (compare with A081699).
%C A234899 Note that, so far, the lengths of the corresponding sequences are contiguous. Does it remain so for next terms?

%e A234899 The aliquot sequence starting at 2 decreases as follows 2->1->0 and is longer than the sequence starting at 1. Hence 2 is in the sequence.
