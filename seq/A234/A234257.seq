%N A234257 Integers n such that the smallest x with sigma(x) == -1 mod n is n - 2.
%C A234257 See examples section for an analysis of first few terms, using A233929(n), the smallest x satisfying sigma(x) == n - 1 modulo n.
%C A234257 Thus many terms will be a prime+2: 4, 5, 7, 9, 15, 21, 31, 39, 45, ... So far, 20 is the only term that is not a prime +2.
%C A234257 But not all primes are represented; the first instance is 13, a prime+2, that is not in the sequence. This is because, for n=13, A233929(13) would have been 11 if one did not have 6 before with sigma(6) = sigma(11) = 12 so also congruent to 13-1.

%e A234257 Take n=4, A233929(4) is 2, since sigma(2)=3 == 3 modulo 4, and we have 4 - 2 = 2.
%e A234257 Take n=5, A233929(5) is 3, since sigma(3)=4 == 4 modulo 5, and we have 5 - 3 = 2.
%e A234257 The same happens for n=7, 9, and 15, A233929(n) being the primes equal to n-2: 5, 7 and 13.
%e A234257 For n=20, A233929(20) is 18, since sigma(18) = 39 == 19 modulo 20, but 20 is not a prime+2.
