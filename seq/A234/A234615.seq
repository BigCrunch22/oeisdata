%N A234615 Number of ways to write n = k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that p = prime(k) + phi(m) and q(p) - 1 are both prime, where phi(.) is Euler's totient function and q(.) is the strict partition function (A000009).
%C A234615 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 7.
%C A234615 (ii) Any integer n > 7 not equal to 15 can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that p = prime(k) + phi(m) and q(p) + 1 are both prime.
%C A234615 (iii) Any integer n > 83 can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that prime(k) + phi(m)/2 is a square. Also, each integer n > 45 can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that prime(k) + phi(m)/2 is a triangular number.
%C A234615 Clearly, part (i) of this conjecture implies that there are infinitely many primes p with q(p) - 1 also prime (cf. A234644).
