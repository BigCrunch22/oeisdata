%N A221211 Numbers n such that n and n + 4 are prime and there is a power of two in the interval (n,n+4).
%C A221211 It is a conjecture that this is a finite sequence. These may be the only known cousin primes with this property.
%C A221211 The Cf.s list similar sequences, of the form -- numbers n such that n and n+m are prime and contain a power of two in the interval (n,n+m). The case where m=2, the twin prime case -- not listed, has only one member n=3. Another member would have to be a twin where n+2 was a Fermat type prime and n a Mersenne prime.
