%N A221642 Square array read by antidiagonals: T(n,k) in which if k = j^2 then column k lists j interleaved with j-1 zeros. Otherwise if k = j^2 + j then column k lists the positive integers, starting with j+1, interleaved with j-1 zeros. Otherwise column k lists only zeros. n>=1, j>=1, k>=1.
%C A221642 The number of positive terms in the n-th antidiagonal equals the number of divisors of n.
%C A221642 The sum of the elements of n-th antidiagonal equals the sum of divisors of n.
%C A221642 All terms of column k are zeros iff k is not a quarter-square A002620.
%C A221642 If only the first two elements are positive integers in the n-th antidiagonal then n is prime.
