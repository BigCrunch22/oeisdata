%N A221914 Array of products of the list entries of the nonempty combinations of n, ordered in a standard way.
%C A221914 The sequence of the row lengths is 2^n-1 = A000225(n), n >= 1.
%C A221914 The combination choose(n,0) is the empty list [], appearing first in the list of combinations of n each taken as a list, called choose(n). The empty combination is not considered in this array. The list of lists choose(n) is ordered according to increasing m from choose(n,m), m = 0, ..., n, and for each m from 1, ..., n the lists are ordered lexicographically. E.g., choose(3) = [[], [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]. The corresponding list of the products of these list entries is then (without the empty list) the row n=3 of the present array [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 6, 6].
%C A221914 The row sums are (n+1)! - 1 = A033312(n+1).
%C A221914 One could add a column k=0 (for the empty combination) and a row n=0 by defining a(n,0) = 1, n >= 0. This enlarged array produces then after summation of the entries deriving from the choose(n,m) list the triangle T(n,m), n >= m >= 0, which coincides with the unsigned Stirling1 triangle if the rows are read backwards: T(n,m) = |S1(n+1,n+1-m)|. See A130534 for |Strirling1(n+1,m+1)|. Proof by showing the recurrence.
%F A221914 a(n,k) = product(choose(n,m,j)[l],l=1..m) if the k-th entry of the choose(n) list (without the leading empty set and ordered as explained in a comment above), is choose(n,m,j), the j-th list member of the list choose(n,m), for n >= 1, 1 <= m <= n, 1 <= j <=  binomial(n,m).

%e A221914 a(3,4) = 2 is the product of the entries of the combination list choose(3,1,1) = [1, 2], the first combination from choose(3,1).
