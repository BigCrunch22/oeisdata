%N A221282 Numbers n such that lambda(n) = lambda(n+1) = lambda(n+2) = lambda(n+3), where lambda(n) = A008836(n) is the Liouville function.
%C A221282 Hildebrand proved that each of the 8 possible 3-tuples of values +1 and -1 occur infinitely often as values of the Liouville function at consecutive arguments. It seems difficult to extend Hildebrand's result to patterns of length larger than 3. However, for results in this direction see Buttkewitz & Elsholtz.

%e A221282 a(1) = 17 because 17, 18, 19, 20 each have an odd number of prime factors (counted with repetition, 1, 3, 1, 3, respectively) and this is the first integer for which this is true.
