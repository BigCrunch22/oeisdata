%N A221641 Square array read by antidiagonals T(n,k) in which column k lists 1 interleaved with j-1 zeros, if k = j^2 or k = j^2 + j, otherwise column k lists only zeros, with n>=1, j>=1, k>=1.
%C A221641 The number of ones in the n-th antidiagonal equals the number of divisors of n.
%C A221641 All terms of column k are zeros iff k is not a quarter-square A002620.
%C A221641 If only the first two elements are ones in the n-th antidiagonal then n is prime.
