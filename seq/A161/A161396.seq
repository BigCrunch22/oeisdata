%N A161396 a(n) = the smallest positive integer that contains the same number of 1's as n when a(n) and n are written in binary, is not coprime to n, and is not a divisor of n.

%e A161396 6_10 (6 in decimal) is 110_2 (110 in binary). 9_10 = 1001_2, which contains the same number of ones in the binary expansion. 9 isn't coprime to 6; they share prime factor 3 and 9 isn't a divisor of 6. No positive integer less than 9 has these properties. Therefore, a(6) = 9.
