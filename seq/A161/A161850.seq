%N A161850 Subsequence of A161986 consisting of all terms that are prime.
%C A161850 A161986(n) = k+r where k is n-th composite and r is remainder of (largest prime divisor of k) divided by (smallest prime divisor k).
%e A161850 A161986(1) to A161986(27) are 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 16, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 25, 27, 27, 29, 31, 32, 35, 35, 37, 37, 39, 40, 41. Hence a(1) to a(11) are the prime terms among them, namely 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31 ,37, 37, 41.
