%N A161435 Number of reduced words of length n in the Weyl group A_3 (or D_3).
%C A161435 a(n) is also the number of vertices of a truncated octahedron (the Voronoi cell for the lattice A_3*) at edge distance n from a given vertex. See also row 4 of the triangle in A008302. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Oct 12 2015, corrected Aug 26 2016.
%C A161435 If the zeros are omitted, this is the coordination sequence for the truncated octahedron (see Karzes link). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 08 2020
%C A161435 Computed with Magma using commands similar to those used to compute A161409.
