%N A161994 Composites with an even remainder if divided by the sum of their prime factors.
%C A161994 The composites A002808(k) have prime factor sums A046343(k). The sequence of remainders, A002808(k) mod A046343(k) = 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 0, ... is scanned for the even terms, occurring at positions k = 1, 3, 9, 10, 11, ..., and the associated A002808(k) are put into the sequence.

%e A161994 The first composite is 4=2*2 and 4 mod (2+2) = 0 is even, so 4 is in the sequence.
%e A161994 The second composite is 6=2*3 and 6 mod (2+3) = 1 is odd, so 6 is not a term.
%e A161994 The third composite is 8=2*2*2 and 8 mod (2+2+2) = 2 is even, so 8 is a term.
