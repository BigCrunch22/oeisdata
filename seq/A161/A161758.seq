%N A161758 a(n)=n-p+1 where p is the maximal prime less than n-2.
%C A161758 By a theorem of Jordan from 1873, a permutation group of degree n is alternating or symmetric if it is a(n)-transitive. For example, a permutation group of degree 100 is alternating or symmetric if it is 4-transitive, since a(100)=100-97+1=4.
