%N A161123 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of fixed-point-free involutions of {1,2,...,2n} having k inversions (0 <= k <= n(2n-1)).
%C A161123 Sum of entries in row n is (2n-1)!! = A001147(n).
%C A161123 Row n has 1 + 2n(n-1) entries.
%C A161123 Sum_{k>=0} k*T(n,k) = (2n-1)!!*n^2 = A161124(n).
%C A161123 A128080 is the same triangle with the 0's deleted.
%F A161123 Generating polynomial of row n is P_n(q) = (q/(1-q^2))^n*Product_{j=1..n}(1-q^(4j-2)).
