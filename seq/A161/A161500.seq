%N A161500 Primes dividing some member of A073833.
%C A161500 Primes that divide A073833(n) will divide A073834(m) for any m > n, and this is all the prime divisors of A073834(m).
%C A161500 Iterating f(x) = x + 1/x modulo p will eventually either produce a zero (in which case p is in this sequence), or it will loop to an earlier term (in which case it is not). Since f(-x) = -f(x), encountering the negation of an earlier term means that the iteration is looping.
%C A161500 Note that A073833(6) = 969581 = 521 * 1861 is the first composite member of that sequence.
