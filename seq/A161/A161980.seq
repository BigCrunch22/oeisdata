%N A161980 a(n) = the smallest positive multiple of n containing {the string made by reversing the order of the binary digits of n, and removing leading 0's} as a substring when a(n) is written in binary.
%e A161980 13 in binary is 1101, which reversed is 1011. a(13) = the positive multiple of 13 that contains the string 1011 as a substring in its binary representation. a(13) therefore equals 91 = 7*13, which is 1011011 in binary. (Binary 91 actually contains the substring 1011 twice.)
