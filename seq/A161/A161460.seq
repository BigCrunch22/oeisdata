%N A161460 Positive integers k such that there is no m different from k where both d(k) = d(m) and d(k+1) = d(m+1), where d(k) is the number of positive divisors of k.
%C A161460 Are these values known to be correct, or are they just conjectures? - _Leroy Quet_, Jun 20 2009 [Answer: all the numbers listed in the Data are known to be correct with the exception of 50175 and 59049, which remain conjectural at this time; see the Mathar link. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Feb 08 2021]
%C A161460 Numbers k that are uniquely identified by the values of the ordered pair (d(k), d(k+1)). - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Aug 11 2019
%C A161460 Conjecture: 2 is the only term that is neither a square nor 1 less than a square. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Aug 12 2019

%e A161460 d(15) = 4, and d(15+1) = 5. Any positive integer m+1 with exactly 5 divisors must be of the form p^4, where p is prime. So m = p^4 - 1 = (p^2+1)*(p+1)*(p-1). Now, in order for d(m) to have exactly 4 divisors, m must either be of the form q^3 or q*r, where q and r are distinct primes. But no p is such that (p^2+1)*(p+1)*(p-1) = q^3. And the only p where (p^2+1)*(p+1)*(p-1) = q*r is p=2 (and so q=5, r=3). So there is only one m where both d(m) = 4 and d(m+1) = 5, which is m=15. Therefore 15 is in this sequence.
