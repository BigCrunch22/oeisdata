%N A161172 a(n) is the order (or period) of the "Yummie" permutation applied to a set of n objects.
%C A161172 The Yummie permutation is done as follows. Start with a packet of n cards (numbered 1 to n from top to bottom), and deal them into two piles, first to a spectator (pile A), and then to yourself (pile B), saying "You, me," silently to yourself over and over. Then, pick up pile B and deal again, first to the spectator, thereby adding to the existing pile A, and then to yourself, forming a new pile B. Repeat, picking up the diminished pile B, and dealing "You, me" as before. Eventually, just one card remains in pile B; place it on top of pile A. The sequence of cards in pile A determines the Yummie permutation ("You, me" said fast sounds like "Yummie").

%e A161172 a(9) = 15, because when the Yummie permutation is applied to {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} we get {6,2,4,8,9,7,5,3,1}, which corresponds to the product of a disjoint five cycle and a three cycle, and hence has order 15.
