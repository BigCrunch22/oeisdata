%N A161769 A positive integer n is included if the greatest common divisor of (the sum of the distinct primes dividing n) and (the sum of the exponents in the prime-factorization of n) is > 1.
%C A161769 n is included if A161606(n) is >= 2.
%e A161769 The prime factorization of 28 is 2^2 * 7^1. The sum of the distinct prime divisors of 28 is 2+7 = 9. The sum of the prime-factorization exponents of 28 is 2+1 = 3. Since gcd(9,3) = 3 is > 1, then 28 is included in this sequence.
