%N A161180 Sum of primes between n^2 and n^2+n, n^2+n and (n+1)^2. The only intervals for which n^2+n is prime are [1,2], [2,4] and the endpoint 2 is included in the sum. One might have written 0,3,5,7,..., etc.
%e A161180 On [1,2] the sum of primes is 2. For [2,4] the sum is 5. [4,6]: 5, [6,9]: 7, [9,12]: 11, [12,16]: 13, [16,20]: 17+19 = 36.
