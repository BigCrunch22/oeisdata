%N A161826 Number of maximal vertex-independent sets in the hypergraph with nodes V = {1, 2, ..., n} and "edges" consisting of the triples (X,Y,Z) with X<Y<Z and X+Y=Z.
%C A161826 A subset S of V is vertex-independent if there is no edge (X,Y,Z) with X, Y, Z all in S.
%F A161826 a(2k)=1, a(2k+1)=4 for k >= 5.
