%N A161575 a(n) = the smallest positive integer with exactly n divisors and that, when represented in binary, contains the binary representation of n as a substring.
%C A161575 If n is prime, then a(n) = p^(n-1) for some prime p (if a(n) exists) as all numbers with n divisors are of this form. - _Chai Wah Wu_, Dec 04 2014

%e A161575 The positive integers with exactly 5 divisors are 16 (10000 in binary), 81 (1010001 in binary), etc. 81 is the smallest of these which contains the binary representation of 5 (101) as a substring. (Like this: {101}0001.) So a(5) = 81.
