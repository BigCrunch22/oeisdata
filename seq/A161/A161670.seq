%N A161670 Sum of largest prime factor of composite(k) for k from smallest prime factor of composite(n) to largest prime factor of composite(n).
%C A161670 "composite(n)" stands for "n-th composite number", so composite(1) to composite(8) are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15.
%e A161670 composite(1) = 4; (smallest prime factor of 4) = (largest prime factor of 4) = 2. composite(2) = 6, (largest prime factor of 6) = 3. Hence a(1) = 3.
%e A161670 composite(5) = 10; (smallest prime factor of 10) = 2, (largest prime factor of 10) = 5. composite(2) to composite(5) are 6, 8, 9, 10, largest prime factors are 3, 2, 3, 5. Hence a(5) = 3+2+3+5 = 13.
%e A161670 composite(7) = 14; (smallest prime factor of 14) = 2, (largest prime factor of 14) = 7. composite(2) to composite(7) are 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, largest prime factors are 3, 2, 3, 5, 3, 7. Hence a(5) = 3+2+3+5+3+7 = 23.
