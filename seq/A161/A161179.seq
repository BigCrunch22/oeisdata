%N A161179 A double interspersion, R(n,k), by antidiagonals.
%C A161179 (1) Every positive integer occurs exactly once; thus as a sequence, A161179
%C A161179 is a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A161179 (2) The double interspersion property for every pair of rows
%C A161179 s=(s(1),s(2),s(3),...) and t=(t(1),t(2),t(3),...) can be stated for
%C A161179 s(1)<t(1) as follows: there exist indices i and j such that
%C A161179 s(i)<s(i+1)<t(j)<t(j+1)<s(i+2)<s(i+3)<t(j+2)<t(j+3)<...
%C A161179 (For a [single] interspersion, see A035513, the Wythoff array.)
%F A161179 If k is odd and n=1: R(n,k)=(1/2)(k^2+2k-1)
%F A161179 if k is odd and n>1: R(n,k)=(1/2)(n^2+(2k-1)n+k^2-2k-1)
%F A161179 if k is even and n=1: R(n,k)=(1/2)(k^2+2k)
%F A161179 if k is even and n>1: R(n,k)=(1/2)(n^2+(2k-3)n+k^2-2k)
%F A161179 To derive the above, use the easily discerned patterns of
%F A161179 the difference array of R. Quite a different construction
%F A161179 of R takes place in two steps: first, form an array U from the
%F A161179 golden mean, tau, and the Fibonacci numbers A000045, as follows:
%F A161179 if n=1 then U(n,k)=F(k+1)
%F A161179 if n>1, then U(n,k)=F(n+k-1)+F(k+2)-tau*F(k+1).
%F A161179 Then replace each U(n,k) by its rank when all the numbers U(n,k)
%F A161179 are arranged in increasing order. The resulting array is R. (The
%F A161179 rows of U are doubly interspersed and satisfy the Fibonacci
%F A161179 recurrence; no array of rational integers has both of those properties.)
