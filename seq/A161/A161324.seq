%N A161324 Let b(m,k) be the k-th binary digit (starting at k=1, reading right to left) in the base-2 representation of m. (So: n = Sum_{k>=0} b(k+1)*2^k.) A positive integer m is included in this sequence if and only if m = Product_{k>=1} k^b(m,k).
%C A161324 Hans Havermann found term a(5).
%C A161324 Jack Brennen says that there are no other terms < 2^32.
%C A161324 a(6) > 2^80 if it exists. - _Bert Dobbelaere_, Apr 19 2019
%e A161324 12 = 1100_2. And 12 = 4^1 * 3^1 * 2^0 * 1^0. So 12 is in the sequence.
