%N A161979 a(1)=1. a(n) = the smallest integer > a(n-1) containing {the string made by reversing the order of the binary digits of n, and removing leading 0's} as a substring when a(n) is written in binary.

%e A161979 13 in binary is 1101, which reversed is 1011. a(13) = the smallest integer > a(12)=14 that contains the string 1011 as a substring in its binary representation. a(13) therefore equals 22, which is 10110 in binary.
