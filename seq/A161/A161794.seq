%N A161794 Largest prime gap for primes less than (n+1)^2.
%e A161794 For n = 1, the primes less than (n+1)^2 = 4 are 2,3. The only prime gap is 3 - 2 = 1, and this is the first element in the sequence.
%e A161794 For n = 2, the primes less than 9 are 2,3,5,7. The prime gaps are {1, 2,2}, of which the largest is 2. This is the second element in the sequence.
