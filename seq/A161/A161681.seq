%N A161681 Primes that are the difference between a cube and a square (conjectured values).
%C A161681 The primes found among the differences are sorted in ascending order and unique primes are then extracted. I call this a "conjectured" sequence since I cannot prove that somewhere on the road to infinity there will never exist an integer pair x,y such that x^3-y^2 = 3,5,17,..., missing prime. For example, testing x^3-y^2 for x,y up to 10000, the count of some duplicates are:
%C A161681 duplicate,count
%C A161681 7,2
%C A161681 11,2
%C A161681 47,3
%C A161681 431,7
%C A161681 503,7
%C A161681 1999,5
%C A161681 28279,11
%C A161681 Yet for 3,5,17,29,... I did not find even one.
%C A161681 [Comment from _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Nov 03 2009: 587 = 783^3 - 21910^2, 769 = 1025^3 - 32816^2, and 971 = 1295^3 - 46602^2 were skipped in the original.]
%C A161681 Conjecture: The number of primes in x^3-y*2 is infinite.
%C A161681 Conjecture: The number of duplicates for a given prime is finite. Then there is the other side - the primes that are not in the sequence 3, 5, 17, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 59, 73, 97, 101, 103, ... Looks like a lot of twin components here. Do these have an analytical form? Is there such a thing as a undecidable sequence?
