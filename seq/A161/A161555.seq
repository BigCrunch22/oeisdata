%N A161555 Numerators of sequence of fractions of primes that minimize absolute value of difference between the fractions and 1/4.
%C A161555 For n = 2, there are two primes available for use in numerator or denominator: 2,3. The best approximation to 1/4 is 2/3. Sequence begins at n = 2.
%e A161555 For n=2, there are two primes available to approximate 1/4. The closest fraction in absolute value is 2/3. The first few approximating fractions are: 2/3, 2/5, 2/7, 3/11, 3/13,...
