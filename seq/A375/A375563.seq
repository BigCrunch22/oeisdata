%N A375563 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number that shares a factor with a(n-1) if a(n-1) is prime, otherwise a(n) is coprime to a(n-1).
%C A375563 The terms are all concentrated along three lines with the central line, consisting entirely of all the odd terms, along the line a(n) = n. Surprisingly however there are no fixed points in the first 100000 terms. In the same range the primes appear in their natural order. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A375563 a(6) = 5 as a(5) = 6 is a composite number, and 5 is the smallest unused number that is coprime to 6.
