%N A375407 Numbers k such that the k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) matches both of the dashed patterns 23-1 and 1-32.
%C A375407 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%C A375407 These are also numbers k such that:
%C A375407 (1) the maximal weakly increasing runs in the reverse of the k-th composition in standard order do not have weakly decreasing leaders, and
%C A375407 (2) the maximal weakly increasing runs in the k-th composition in standard order do not have weakly decreasing leaders.
