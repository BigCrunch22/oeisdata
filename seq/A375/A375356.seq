%N A375356 T(m, n) is the number of m X n toroidal knot/link mosaics read by rows, with 1 <= n <= m.
%C A375356 An m X n mosaic is an m X n array of the 11 tiles given by Lomonaco and Kauffman. A period m X n mosaic is an m X n mosaic whose opposite edges are identified. A toroidal m X n mosaic is an equivalence class of period m X n mosaics up to finite sequences of cyclic rotations of rows and columns. A toroidal mosaic depicts the projection of a knot or link on the surface of a torus iff the connection points of each tile coincide with those of the contiguous tiles and with those of the tiles on identified edges.
%C A375356 The first five rows of the triangle are from Table 2 of Oh, Hong, Lee, Lee, and Yeon.
%C A375356 Clearly, T(m,n) <= A375355(m,n) for all m,n, with equality iff m = n = 1.

%e A375356 The only period 1 X 1 link mosaics are given by the tiles T_0 and T_5 through T_10 of Lomonaco and Kauffman. None of these mosaics are cyclic rotations of rows and columns of the others (since there are no rows or columns to permute in the first place). Therefore, T(1,1) = 7.
