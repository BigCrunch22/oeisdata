%N A375890 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number such that a(n) is coprime to a(n-1) and (a(n) AND a(n-1)) = min(a(n), a(n-1)), where AND is the binary AND operation.
%C A375890 The fixed points begin 1, 8, 9, 7453, 9338, although there are likely more.
%C A375890 The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
