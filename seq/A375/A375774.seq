%N A375774 The number of n-digit integers that can be written as the product of n single-digit integers. The single-digit integers need not be distinct.
%C A375774 a(21)=1 (9^21 has 21 digits). For all n>21, a(n)=0.

%e A375774 a(2) is 27 because 27 2-digit integers can be written as the product of 2 single-digit integers. Those 27 integers are: 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 32, 35, 36, 40, 42, 45, 48, 49, 54, 56, 63, 64, 72 and 81. Note that each of the 2-digit integers 12, 16, 18, 24 and 36 can be expressed as a product of 2 single-digit integers in more than 1 way. However, each of those 2-digit integers is only counted once.
