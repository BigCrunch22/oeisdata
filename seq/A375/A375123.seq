%N A375123 Weakly increasing run-leader transformation for standard compositions.
%C A375123 The a(n)-th composition in standard order lists the leaders of weakly increasing runs of the n-th composition in standard order.
%C A375123 The leaders of weakly increasing runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal weakly increasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.
%C A375123 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
