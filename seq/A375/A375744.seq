%N A375744 Numbers that are the sum of 4 but no fewer nonzero squares and admit a representation with 4 distinct squares.
%C A375744 Intersection of A004215 and A004433.
%e A375744 39 is a term, since it requires 4 squares to be represented and admits the representation 39 = 5^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2.
%e A375744 30 is not a term, although it can be represented as a sum of 4 different squares 30 = 4^2+ 3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 also admits a representation as a sum of 3 squares: 30 = 5^2 + 2^2 + 1^2.
%e A375744 7 is not a term, since although it requires 4 squares to be represented as follows 7 = 2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2, it is noted that 1 is used on more than one occasion.
%Y A375744 Cf. A004215, A004433.
