%N A375889 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 3; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number such that a(n) shares a factor with a(n-1) and (a(n) AND a(n-1)) = min(a(n), a(n-1)), where AND is the binary AND operation.
%C A375889 The fixed points begin 1, 12, 284, 50726, 50764, 50770, 50772, 50811, although there are likely more.
%C A375889 The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A375889 a(4) = 5 as 5 shares a factor with a(3) = 15 and min(15,5) = 5 and (5 AND 15) = 101_2 AND 1111_2 = 101_2 = 5.
