%N A375088 Mountain Sequence: Sequence that when expressed as non-overlapping mountains, the n-th term is the height and base of the n-th mountain.
%C A375088 A mountain with base b and height h is a segment starting with b, then climbs to b+h, and goes back to b. So as an example, (1, 2, 3, 2, 1) is a mountain with base of 1 and height of 2.
%C A375088 All positive integers appear in the sequence infinitely many times.

%F A375088 |a(n+1) - a(n)| = 1.
%e A375088 a(1) = 1, so the first non-overlapping mountain is 1, 2, 1 with h = b = 1.
%e A375088 Now, a(2) = 2, so the mountain 2, 3, 4, 3, 2 with b = h = 2 is appended to the sequence, and so on.
