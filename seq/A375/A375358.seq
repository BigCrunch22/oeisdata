%N A375358 a(n) is the greatest difference between m and k, with m, k both prime such that k + m = p + q, where (p, q) is the n-th twin prime pair.
%C A375358 If p and q are twin primes and x is their average, then among all pairs of primes (k, m) such that |x - k| = |x - m|, it is observed that p and q are at the smallest distance from x, which is 1. Our interest lies in finding the pair (m, k) such that the distance to x is maximum and then determining |k - m|.
%e A375358 Since the 3rd pair of twin primes is (11, 13), whose sum is 24, and the other pairs of primes that sum to 24 are (5, 19) and (7, 17), the greatest difference is 19 - 5 = 14. Therefore, a(3) = 14.
