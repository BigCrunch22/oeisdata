%N A375710 Numbers k such that A013929(k+1) - A013929(k) = 2. In other words, the k-th nonsquarefree number is 2 less than the next nonsquarefree number.
%C A375710 The difference of consecutive nonsquarefree numbers is at least 1 and at most 4, so there are four disjoint sequences of this type:
%C A375710 - A375709 (difference 1)
%C A375710 - A375710 (difference 2)
%C A375710 - A375711 (difference 3)
%C A375710 - A375712 (difference 4)
%F A375710 Complement of A375709 U A375711 U A375712.
%e A375710 The initial nonsquarefree numbers are 4, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24, 25, which first increase by 2 after the fifth and sixth terms.
%t A375710 Join@@Position[Differences[Select[Range[1000], !SquareFreeQ[#]&]],2]
%Y A375710 Positions of 2's in A078147.
%Y A375710 For prime numbers we have A029707.
%Y A375710 For nonprime numbers we appear to have A014689.
%Y A375710 A005117 lists the squarefree numbers, first differences A076259.
%Y A375710 A013929 lists the nonsquarefree numbers, first differences A078147.
%Y A375710 A053797 gives lengths of runs of nonsquarefree numbers, firsts A373199.
%Y A375710 A375707 counts squarefree numbers between consecutive nonsquarefree numbers.
