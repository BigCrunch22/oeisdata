%N A375626 Irregular table read by rows: row n is the integers of the form d_1 - d_2 + d_3 - d_4 + ... + (-1)^k d_k, where n = d_1 > d_2 > ... > d_k = 1, d_{i+1} divides d_i for 1 <= i <= k-1.
%C A375626 Note that the numbers in row n > 1 are at least d_1 - d_2 >= n - n/lpf(n), and the inequality is strict unless n is prime, where lpf(n) = A020639(n) is the smallest prime divisor of n.
%C A375626 For n != 2, we can always suppose that d_i != 2: 2 can only be the penultimate member of (d_1,...,d_k), but (d_1,...,d_{k-2},2,1) and (d_1,...,d_{k-2},1) give the same alternating sum.
%C A375626 Let S(n) = {Sum_{i=1..k} (-1)^i d_i : n = d_1 > d_2 > ... > d_k = 1, d_{i+1} | d_i}, then by enumerating d_2, we have S(n) = U_{d|n,d<n} (n - S(d)) = n - U_{d|n,d<n} S(d), where n - S = {n - a : a in S}. As an example, this implies that S(2^m) is the set of odd numbers in the range [2^(m-1),2^m] for m >= 2.
%C A375626 If we define T(n) = {Sum_{i=1..k} (-1)^i d_i : d_1 > d_2 > ... > d_k = 1, d_1 | n, d_{i+1} | d_i}, then T(n) = U_{d|n} S(d) by definition. By considering the cases d_1 = n and d_1 < n, we have T(n) = S(n) U (n - S(n)). Note that this union is a disjoint union for n > 2, as S(n) contains only numbers > n/2 and hence n - S(n) contains only numbers < n/2.
%C A375626 Note that m in S(n) does not imply k*m in S(k*n) for k > 1, for example 97 = 100 - 4 + 1 is in S(100), but 388 = 4*97 is not in S(400).
