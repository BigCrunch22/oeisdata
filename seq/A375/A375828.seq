%N A375828 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number such that (a(n-1) AND a(n)) = a(n-1) if a(n-1) is prime, otherwise (a(n-1) AND a(n)) = 0, where AND is the binary AND operation.
%C A375828 The terms form a pattern similar to that in A109812. In the first 250000 terms the fixed points are 1, 2, 3, 8, 3650, 50624, 203074. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
