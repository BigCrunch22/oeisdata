%N A375564 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number that is coprime to a(n-1) if a(n-1) is prime, otherwise a(n) shares a factor with a(n-1).
%C A375564 The sequence contains groups of consecutive primes separated by groups of composite terms, each group containing more terms as n increases. See the attached image of the first 100000 terms. In this same range the primes appear in their natural order.
%C A375564 The fixed points being 1, 2, 3, 4, 15, 51, 63, 363, 437; there are thirty-two in the first 100000 terms although it is likely there are arbitrarily more. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A375564 a(8) = 7 as a(7) = 5 is a prime number, and 7 is the smallest unused number that is coprime to 5.
