%N A375399 Numbers k such that the minima of maximal anti-runs in the weakly increasing sequence of prime factors of k (with multiplicity) are not distinct.
%C A375399 An anti-run is a sequence with no adjacent equal terms.
%C A375399 The minima of maximal anti-runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal anti-run subsequences and taking the least term of each.
%C A375399 Note the prime factors can alternatively be taken in weakly decreasing order.

%e A375399 The prime factors of 300 are {2,2,3,5,5}, with maximal anti-runs ((2),(2,3,5),(5)), with minima (2,2,5), so 300 is in the sequence.
%e A375399 The prime factors of 450 are {2,3,3,5,5}, with maximal anti-runs ((2,3),(3,5),(5)), with minima (2,3,5), so 450 is not in the sequence.
