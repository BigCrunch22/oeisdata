%N A375805 Decimal expansion of Sum_{n >= 1} 1/A171397(n).
%C A375805 A variation on the harmonic series, in which the denominators are treated as base 11 numbers. Equivalently: sum of reciprocals of positive integers whose base-11 representation contains no digit A (no "10" digit).
%C A375805 Values were calculated using Mathematica code from Baillie & Schmelzer (see link). Note that the code in the Wolfram Library Archive, as it stands, does not support digits > 9 in bases > 10 (and doing the "obvious" thing will be interpreted as asking a different question with a different answer); the code was modified to support this.
%C A375805 A proof that the series converges is given by John D. Cook (see link). (The proof is very easy. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 31 2024)
%C A375805 There is a slight ambiguity when we get to 1/10. This is to be regarded as 1/(1*11 + 0*1) = (1/11)-in-base-10 and not as 1/A =  1/(10*1) = (1/10)-in-base-10. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 30 2024
