%N A375805 Decimal expansion of Sum_{n >= 1} 1/A171397(n).
%C A375805 The value 23.220327131143629469843263809820... is wrong.  It uses base 11 numbers that avoid 10, NOT those that avoid A. Thanks to _Amiram Eldar_ for this correction.  The value of this constant is presently unknown.  - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 02 2024
%C A375805 A variation on the harmonic series, in which the denominators are treated as base 11 numbers.
%C A375805 A proof that the series converges is given by John D. Cook (see link). (The proof is very easy. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 31 2024)
%C A375805 There is a slight ambiguity when we get to 1/10. This is to be regarded as 1/(1*11 + 0*1) = (1/11)-in-base-10 and not as 1/A =  1/(10*1) = (1/10)-in-base-10. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 30 2024
