%C A375142 Subsequence of A013929 and first differs from it at n = 27: A013929(27) = 72 = 2^3 * 3^2 is not a term of this sequence.
%C A375142 Numbers whose prime factorization has one distinct exponent that does not equal 1.
%C A375142 Numbers that are a product of a squarefree number (A005117) and a power of a different squarefree number that is not squarefree.
%C A375142 The asymptotic density of this sequence is Sum_{k>=2} (d(k)-1)/zeta(2) = 0.36113984820338109927..., where d(k) = zeta(k) * Product_{p prime} (1 + Sum_{i=k+1..2*k-1} (-1)^i/p^i), if k is even, and d(k) = (zeta(2*k)/zeta(k)) * Product_{p prime} (1 + 2/p^k + Sum_{i=k+1..2*k-1} (-1)^(i+1)/p^i) if k is odd > 1.
