%N A375244 List of triples {w;x;y} where «w» is the w-th «pyramid», "x" = the number of elements in the «pyramid» that are not erased (before the end-level erasure); "y" is the number of steps in the pyramid until the iteration stops. See the Comments section for more details.
%C A375244 Start the top of a "pyramid" with an integer w.
%C A375244 Form the lower level by adding w to each digit of w.
%C A375244 Erase any term having one or more duplicates, as well as its duplicates.
%C A375244 Iterate.
%C A375244 All "pyramids" will be blocked at some point, because their lowest level will end up completely erased.

%e A375244 .
%e A375244 The iteration stops there. w = 1, x = 13 as 13 terms were not erased in the blocked pyramid, y = 12 as the now blocked-pyramid has 12 levels.
%e A375244 Those numbers form the first triple of the sequence {1;13;12}.
