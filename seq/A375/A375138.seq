%N A375138 Numbers k such that the k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) matches the dashed pattern 23-1.
%C A375138 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%C A375138 These are also numbers k such that the maximal weakly increasing runs in the reverse of the k-th composition in standard order do not have weakly decreasing leaders, where the leaders of weakly increasing runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal weakly increasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.
%C A375138 The reverse version (A375137) ranks compositions matching the dashed pattern 1-32.
