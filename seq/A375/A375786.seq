%N A375786 a(n) is the minimum volume of an integer-sided cuboid having the same surface as a cube with edge length n.
%C A375786 Conjecture: From the integer-sided cuboids with same surface 6*n^2 always the one with the smallest edge length has the minimum volume. If there are several integer-sided cuboids having the smallest edge length, then the one with the smallest second smallest edge length has the minimum volume (checked up to a(1000)).
%C A375786 The maximum volume is always A000578(n) = n^3.

%e A375786 a(6) = 104: because from the five integer-sided cuboids (2, 2, 26), (2, 5, 14), (2, 6, 12), (3, 6, 10), (6, 6, 6) having the same surface as a cube with edge length 6 (see example in A375785) has (2, 2, 26) with 2*2*26 = 104 the smallest volume.
