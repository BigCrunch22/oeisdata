%N A375361 Odd numbers with at least two prime divisors of the form 4*k + 1 counted with multiplicity.
%C A375361 Odd numbers k such that k^2 can be expressed as the arithmetic mean of two distinct perfect squares in more than one way. For example, 25^2 = (5^2 + 35^2)/2 = (17^2 + 31^2)/2.
%C A375361 Let x be a squared integer which is the central element of a 3 X 3 magic square in which seven (or more) of the entries are squared integers. If the greatest common divisor of all nine entries is 1, then the square root of x is a composite number that is divisible only by primes congruent to 1 mod 4. For example, sqrt(A221669(5)) = 425 is both in A004613 and in this sequence.
%e A375361 65 is in this sequence because 65 has two prime factors of the form 4*k + 1, namely 5 = 4*1 + 1 and 13 = 4*3 + 1.
