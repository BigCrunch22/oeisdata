%N A375995 Least integer x such that every set of the length-n subwords of some binary word y is achievable by taking the subwords of some word of length <= x.
%C A375995 Another way to say this is that a(n) is the least integer x such that every subset of vertices encountered by some walk on the de Bruijn graph of order n is achievable by a walk of length <= x-n.   (Length = number of edges)
%e A375995 For n = 1,2,3,4 examples of a longest word (whose set of length-n subwords did not appear as the subwords of any shorter word) are 01, 00110, 0001011100, 000010010101100101101111.
