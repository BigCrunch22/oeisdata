%N A375217 Primes p such that p^64 + 2^64 is prime.
%C A375217 It is conjectured that solutions for p1^n + p2^n = p3 (where p1, p2, and p3 are all primes and n is a natural number) exist only when n is itself a power of two (when n is a number in A000079); and would have infinitely many solutions.
%C A375217 But it's proven that either p1 or p2 must be a 2.
