%N A375923 Number of permutations of size n which are both two-clumped and co-two-clumped.
%C A375923 Two-clumped permutations are (3-51-2-4, 3-51-4-2, 2-4-51-3, 4-2-51-3)-avoiding permutations. Co-two-clumped permutations are (3-15-2-4, 3-15-4-2, 2-4-15-3, 4-2-15-3)-avoiding permutations. Thus, this sequence enumerates permutations that avoid all these eight patterns.
%C A375923 a(n) is also the number of strong (=generic) rectangulations of size n whose strong poset is totally ordered.
