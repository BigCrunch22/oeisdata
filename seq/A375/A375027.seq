%N A375027 Number of occurrences of Easter Sunday on March 22, March 23, ..., April 25 during a 532-year Julian Easter cycle.
%C A375027 During any 532-year range of the Julian Calendar, each of the 35 possible dates for Easter Sunday occurs either 4, 8, 12, 16, or 20 times. This cycle is much simpler than the Gregorian Easter cycle (A224110).
%F A375027 Use the Julian Easter algorithm in A348924 for years 1 to 532 (or any range of 532 years), and tally the occurrence of each Easter date between March 22 and April 25.
%Y A375027 Cf. A224110 (frequencies for Gregorian Easter Sunday dates).
