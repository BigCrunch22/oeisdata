%N A375504 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of crystallized linear chord diagrams on n chords with k short chords.
%C A375504 In a linear chord diagram a "bubble" is defined as a set of consecutive vertices such that no two adjacent vertices are joined by a chord, i.e., "short" chords are not allowed. A bubble is therefore bounded externally either by short chords, or by the ends of the diagram. In a crystallized diagram, all chords are either short, or "bridge" two distinct bubbles, i.e., they have one vertex in one bubble, and the other vertex in a separate bubble. T(n,k) is the number of such crystallized diagrams built from n > 0 chords, exactly k > 0 of which are short.

%e A375504 For n = 3, let the vertices of the linear chord diagram be A,B,C,D,E,F. There are two diagrams with a single short chord: (AF)(BE)(CD) and (AE)(BF)(CD), and so T(3,1) = 2. There are three diagrams with two short chords: (AB)(CF)(DE), (AD)(BC)(EF), and (AF)(BC)(DE), and so T(3,2) = 3. Finally, there is one diagram with all three chords short: (AB)(CD)(EF), and so T(3,3)=1.
