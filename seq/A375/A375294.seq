%N A375294 Number of winning combinations in the game Icosahedron Bingo after n rolls.
%C A375294 In the game "Icosahedron Bingo" each player picks 9 numbers between 1 and 20 and places them in a 3 X 3 grid. Then an icosahedron showing the numbers from 1 to 20 is rolled and the players cross out the rolled number if this number appears in their grid. The player who first crosses out a row, a column or a diagonal has won, just like in the normal Bingo game.
%e A375294 a(3) = 48: There are 3 rows, 3 columns and 2 diagonals, which gives 8 alignments to achieve Bingo. If the numbers in one alignment are called a, b and c then there are 6 possible permutations: abc, acb, bac, bca, cab and cba. 8 alignments times 6 permutations equals 48.
