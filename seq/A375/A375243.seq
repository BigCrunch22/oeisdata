%N A375243 Infinite variant of A375232.
%C A375243 Instead of stopping the sequence when no integer is available, we extend it with 0 and go on (0 being the only term allowed to be repeated whenever nothing else works). This method seems to work ad infinitum.
%C A375243 Around 90% of the terms are not equal to 0.
%C A375243 For the first 1000 terms, the largest chunk between two successive 0 is the 24-integer long serie [101101, 2630, 8015, 40044, 10122, 333330, 1907, 200222, 10456, 10200, 80008, 101110, 3204, 5107, 6660, 9012, 1400, 202000, 8051, 10276, 40400, 101111, 20223, 5109].
%e A375243 The finite sequence A375232 ends with 80, 109, 230, 10457. If we extend it with a(23) = 0, we can compute a(24) = 120, a(25) = 306 then 110, 204, 1058, 303 and 10279. No more integers are available at that stage. But, again, we can extend the sequence with a(31) = 0, then a(32) = 1046 and 302, 501, 0, 201, 3048, 170, etc.
%e A375243 A repeated single 0 is counted as a term of the sequence.
%Y A375243 Cf. A284516, A375232.
