%N A375140 Number of integer compositions of n whose leaders of weakly increasing runs are not strictly decreasing.
%C A375140 The leaders of weakly increasing runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal weakly increasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.
%C A375140 Also the number of integer compositions of n matching the dashed patterns 1-32 or 1-21.
