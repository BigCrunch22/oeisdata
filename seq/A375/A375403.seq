%N A375403 Numbers whose maximal anti-runs of weakly increasing prime factors (with multiplicity) do not have distinct maxima.
%C A375403 First differs from A299117 in having 150.
%C A375403 An anti-run is a sequence with no adjacent equal terms. The maxima of maximal anti-runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal anti-run subsequences and taking the greatest term of each.
%C A375403 The partitions with these Heinz numbers are those with (1) some part appearing more than twice or (2) the greatest part appearing more than once.
%C A375403 Note the prime factors can alternatively be written in weakly decreasing order.
%e A375403 The maximal anti-runs of prime factors of 150 are ((2,3,5),(5)), with maxima (5,5), so 150 is in the sequence.
%e A375403 The maximal anti-runs of prime factors of 180 are ((2),(2,3),(3,5)), with maxima (2,3,5), so 180 is not in the sequence.
%e A375403 The maximal anti-runs of prime factors of 300 are ((2),(2,3,5),(5)), with maxima (2,5,5), so 300 is in the sequence.
