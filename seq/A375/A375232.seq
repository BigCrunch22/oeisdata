%N A375232 Two terms that contain the digit "d" are always separated by "d" terms that do not contain the digit "d". This is the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct nonnegative integers with this property.
%C A375232 The sequence is finite, there is no 23rd term.

%e A375232 As we start the sequence with a(1) = 0, the digit 0 must be present in every term of the sequence.
%e A375232 We extend it now with a(2) = 10 as 10 is the smallest integer not present that contains the digit 0.
%e A375232 The next term will be a(3) = 20 as 20 is the smallest integer not present that contains the digit 0.
%e A375232 The next term will be a(4) = 100 as 100 is the smallest integer not present that contains both the digits 0 and 1.
%e A375232 The next term will be a(5) = 30 as 30 is the smallest integer not present that contains the digit 0.
%e A375232 The next term will be a(6) = 102 as 102 is the smallest integer not present that contains the digits 0, 1 and 2.
%e A375232 The next term will be a(7) = 40 as 40 is the smallest integer not present that contains the digit 0.
%e A375232 The next term will be a(8) = 101 as 101 is the smallest integer not present that contains both the digits 0 and 1.
