%N A375494 a(n) = minimum number of operations chosen from f(x) = 3x+1 and g(x) = floor(x/2) needed to reach n when starting from 1.
%C A375494 The Collatz problems (related problems known by various names, see references) involve iterating the Collatz Mapping (A006370) which applies either 3n+1 or n/2 iteratively when n is odd or even respectively. Considering f(x)=3x+1 and g(x)=x/2 as integer operations of interest, we ask what is the shortest sequence of these operation that produces the nonnegative integers starting with x_0=1. One is chosen as the starting value since producing the number one is the stopping condition for the Hailstone sequences (A006577). The number of distinct shortest sequences of operations (A375495) and the numbers with unique, shortest constructions (A375496) are also of interest.
%C A375494 Seems likely there is a sequence of f and g starting from 1 to reach each nonnegative integer, but a proof has not been proposed.
