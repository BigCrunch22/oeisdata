%N A375746 The alternating sum of sequentially decreasing moduli for every positive integer.
%C A375746 It is expected that this sequence will contain all integers, however in the first 25000 terms, there are only 14907 distinct integers, with -39 and 54 being the two 2 digit numbers not appearing in the first 25000 terms. This sequence, while generated in a different manner, appears to be A154585 shifted over one term and without the absolute value taken.

%F A375746 a(n) = Sum_{k=1..n} (-1)^(n-k) * (n mod k).
%e A375746 For n=6, a(6) = (6 mod 6)-(6 mod 5)+(6 mod 4)-(6 mod 3)+(6 mod 2)-(6 mod 1) = 0-1+2-0+0-0 = 1.
