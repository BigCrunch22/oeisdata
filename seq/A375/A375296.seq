%N A375296 Numbers k such that the leaders of maximal weakly increasing runs in the reverse of the k-th composition in standard order (row k of A228351) are not strictly decreasing.
%C A375296 The leaders of maximal weakly increasing runs in a sequence are obtained by splitting it into maximal weakly increasing subsequences and taking the first term of each.
%C A375296 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%C A375296 Also numbers k such that the k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) matches the dashed patterns 23-1 or 12-1.
