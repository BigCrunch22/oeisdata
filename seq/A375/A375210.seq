%N A375210 a(n) is the smallest k >= 1 such that i^2 + k is not divisible by any of the first n odd primes, for any integer i.
%C A375210 Only odd primes are considered since the conditions could not be satisfied for prime 2; i.e., cannot find a k which avoids i^2 + k divisible by 2 over all integers i.
%C A375210 The conditions are that -k is not a quadratic residue mod any of the first n odd primes.
%C A375210 Each odd prime has one or more quadratic non-residues and the Chinese Remainder Theorem can assemble combinations of them to find candidate k values, of which a(n) is the smallest.
%C A375210 The sequence is weakly increasing a(n+1) >= a(n) since each additonal odd prime adds a residue class condition.
%C A375210 Equality a(n) = a(n+1) = k occurs when k already satisfies the additional condition at n+1; i.e., -k is already a non-residue mod prime(n+1).
%C A375210 a(n) can be estimated by (Product_{i=2..n} prime(i)) / (Product_{i=2..n} (prime(i)-1)/2).
%C A375210 This formula works because (prime(i) - 1) / 2 is the number of quadratic residues modulo prime(i), so total possible residue combinations over the acceptable combinations.
%C A375210 As an observation, most values of k tend to be odd. This might be because the absence of factors in a number tends to favor the properties that k must satisfy. Since this seems to be the case, odd numbers can utilize the full list of primes among their potential values for k, while even numbers will always have at least 2 as a factor, thus contributing to the generally undesired compositeness of k.
%e A375210 For n=1, the first 1 odd prime is 3 and a(1) = k = 1 has i^2 + 1 never divisible by 3.
%e A375210 For n=3, the first 3 odd primes are {3,5,7} and a(3) = k = 22 has i^2 + 22 never divisible by any of 3,5,7.
%e A375210 As we progress further along the sequence, the values of k tend to grow significantly, such as a(43) = 1065437749777.
%e A375210 For n=4, the estimate formula is (3*5*7*11) / (1*2*3*5) = 38.5 as compared to the actual a(4) = 37.
