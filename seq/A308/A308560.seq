%N A308560 Numbers divisible by the LCM of all sums of any two digits (at distinct positions).
%C A308560 The sequence trivially includes the single-digit numbers, their multiples of 10, and more generally any near-repdigit number having all digits equal and nonzero, except for a trailing 0, i.e., of the form d*(10^n-10)/9, 1 <= d <= 9, n > 1.
%C A308560 If a number has more than one digit 0, the relevant LCM is zero and will never divide such a number.
%C A308560 Between 84 and 10^4 there are only 13 terms without digit 0: (252, 1212, 1512, 2112, 2424, 2772, 3636, 4224, 4848, 6216, 6336, 8316, 8448), cf. A308561.
%e A308560 For single-digit numbers 1, 2, ..., 9, there is no sum of two digits, and since the LCM of an empty set is taken to be 1, it divides the number.
%e A308560 Two-digit terms are in the sequence iff they are divisible by the sum of their digits. This includes multiples of ten: 10, 20, ..., 90, but also less trivial examples as 12, 18, 21, ...
%e A308560 The first 3-digit term having no digit 0 is 252, divisible by both, 2 + 5 = 7 and  2 + 2 = 4.
%o A308560 (PARI) is(n,d=digits(n))={n<10||vecsort(d)[2]&&0==n%lcm(concat(vector(-1+n=#d,i,t=d[1+n-i];vector(n-i,j,t+d[j]))))}
