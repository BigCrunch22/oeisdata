%N A308393 "Autotomy numbers" have two properties: (1) they have distinct decimal digits, and (2) subtracting their last digit from the remaining part produces another autotomy number (the numbers 1 to 9 are considered to be part of the sequence).
%C A308393 There are exactly 41943 autotomy numbers. For autotomy numbers with 10 distinct decimal digits, see the Crossref section.

%e A308393 a(56) = 243 is in the sequence because 24-3 = 21 and 21 is already in the sequence. The same is true for a(57) = 254 as 25-4 = 21 too.
%Y A308393 Cf. A308377 (autotomy numbers with 10 distinct decimal digits).
