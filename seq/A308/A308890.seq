%N A308890 Follow along the squares in the square spiral (as in A274640); in each square write the smallest positive number that a knight placed at that square cannot see.
%C A308890 Similar to A274640, except that here we consider the mex of squares that are a knight's moves rather than queen's moves.
%C A308890 Since there are at most 4 earlier cells in the spiral at a knight's move from any square, a(n) <= 5.
%C A308890 This is obtained by adding 1 to the terms of A308884. "Mex" here means minimal positive excluded value.
%Y A308890 Cf. A247640, A274641, A308885-A308895.
