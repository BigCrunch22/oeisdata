%N A308961 Numbers k not divisible by 10 such that k^2 and 2*k are in A046030.
%C A308961 10^j - 3 are terms. Most of the terms so far are of the form 10^j - 3. Are there other terms not of this form besides 2, 20247, and 2224745247?
%C A308961 If k is a term, then primes of the form k*10^j + 1 for j >= A055642(2*k) are in A308917 and primes of the form 10^j + k for j >= A055642(k^2) are in A308917.
