%N A308660 For any Gaussian integer z, let d(z) be the distance from z to the nearest Gaussian prime distinct from z; we build an undirected graph G on top of the Gaussian prime numbers as follows: two Gaussian prime numbers p and q are connected iff at least one of d(p) or d(q) equals the distance from p to q; a(n) is the number of elements in the connected component of G containing A002145(n).
%C A308660 A002145 corresponds to the natural numbers that are also Gaussian prime numbers.
%C A308660 This sequence generalizes to Gaussian integers an idea developed in A308261.
%C A308660 Visually, the connected components of G appear like constellations (see representation in Links section).

%e A308660 For n=3:
%e A308660 - A002145(3) = 11,
%e A308660 - the nearest Gaussian primes to 11 (at equal distance) are 10+i and 10-i,
%e A308660 - the other Gaussian primes around 11, 10+i and 10-i are nearer from other Gaussian primes,
%e A308660 - so the connected component containing 11 contains: 11, 10+i and 10-i,
%e A308660 - and a(3) = 3.
