%N A308590 Langton's ant on a Penrose rhomb tiling: number of black cells after n moves of the ant.
%C A308590 The ant lives on a centrally symmetric Penrose rhomb tiling with a "Sun" patch (S configuration, cf. A242935) at the center and starts on one of the thick rhombs of that patch, looking towards one of the outward edges of that tile. On a white rhomb, turn to the next edge of that cell in clockwise direction, flip the color of the rhomb, then move forward one unit. On a black rhomb, turn to the next edge of that cell in counterclockwise direction, flip the color of the rhomb, then move forward one unit.
%C A308590 In contrast to the corresponding sequences for Langton's ant on periodic tilings, like the square tiling (A255938) or a hexagonal tiling (A269757), this sequence is most likely not unique. A Penrose tiling lacks translational symmetry, meaning any two finite regions in the tiling that are identical are surrounded by different patches of tiles when examining a large enough region of the surrounding tiles. Therefore I suspect that, unless the trajectory of the ant is bounded to stay inside a finite region of the tiling, the trajectories of any two ants placed at different starting points on the tiling will diverge at some point.
