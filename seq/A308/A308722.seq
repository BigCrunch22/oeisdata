%N A308722 Number of edges in the smallest possible regular graceful graph of valence n.
%C A308722 A graceful graph with e edges is one that allows a labeling of its vertices with distinct integers between 0 and e, inclusive, such that when each edge is labeled with the absolute difference of the labels of its endpoints, these edge labels will be exactly the integers between 1 and e, inclusive.
%C A308722 This sequence counts the minimal number edges possible, in a regular graceful graph of valence n.
%C A308722 The concept was introduced by Ed Pegg in a post on Mathematics Stack Exchange; all the data here is from that post.
%C A308722 Pegg conjectures that the sequence continues (from n = 13): 130, 147, 180, 192, 221, 243, 285, 320, 336.
