%N A308722 Number of edges in the smallest possible regular graceful graph of valence n.
%C A308722 A graceful graph with e edges is one that allows a labeling of its vertices with distinct integers between 0 and e, inclusive, such that when each edge is labeled with the absolute difference of the labels of its endpoints, these edge labels will be exactly the integers between 1 and e, inclusive.
%C A308722 This sequence counts the minimal number edges possible, in a regular graceful graph of valence n.
%C A308722 The concept was introduced by _Ed Pegg Jr_ in a post on Mathematics Stack Exchange; all the data here is from that post.
%C A308722 Pegg conjectures that the sequence continues (from n = 13): 130, 147, 180, 192, 221, 243, 285.
%H A308722 Mathematics Stack Exchange, <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3246000/graceful-graphs-with-valence-k">Graceful graphs with Valence k</a>
%F A308722 Conjecture: a(2*n) = 3*n^2 = A033428(n). - _Ed Pegg Jr_, Dec 11 2024
