%N A308437 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = number of ways, summed over the free n-ominoes, that an n-omino with an assigned orientation can be maximally (partially) covered by k X 1 tiles.
%C A308437 Null tilings (no k X 1 tiles at all) are not counted. _Peter Munn_, May 30 2019
%C A308437 There are A000105(n) free n-ominoes. In a loop over all of them, first consider one fixed representative.
%C A308437 Consider the straight k-ominoes (in horizontal or vertical alignments commensurate with the grid of the n-omino), and let c(i,n,k) be the maximum number of straight k-ominoes in any mixture of vertical-horizontal alignments that can be placed inside the i-th n-omino such that no k-ominoes overlap and such that all cells of the k-ominoes are cells of the n-omino.
%C A308437 Obviously c(i,n,k) <= floor(n/k): The coverage by a set of fixed k-ominoes is always incomplete if k is not a divisor of n.
%C A308437 Count all configurations with the number of c(i,n,k) k-ominos in the representative. Configurations with distinct multisets of k-ominoes are considered distinct, even if rotations or flips of the (partially) covered n-omino may exist that map these onto others.
%C A308437 T(n,k) is the number of (partial) tilings of the free n-ominoes with c(i,n,k) straight k-ominoes.

%e A308437 From _M. F. Hasler_ and _R. J. Mathar_, May 27 2019: (Start)
%e A308437 We have T(n,1) = A000105(n) which is the number of different inequivalent n-ominoes, and each one can be maximally filled in exactly one (trivial) way with 1 X 1 monominoes.
%e A308437 We have T(n,n) = 1 because only the straight n X 1 polyomino can be filled in the required way, namely with only straight n-ominoes.
%e A308437 T(3,2) = 4 counts 2 ways of placing a domino into the straight tromino (the two ends of the tromino considered distinct) and 2 ways of placing a domino into the L-tromino (again the two variants obtained by flipping along the diagonal considered distinct). (End)
