%N A308172 a(0)=1; thereafter a(n) = smallest number missing from A081145 after A081145(n) has been calculated.
%C A308172 More than the usual number of terms are shown in order to emphasize the irregularities.
%C A308172 Usually the terms appear in groups of three, but there are many irregularities. To see them, take this sequence, apply the RUNS transform twice, and bisect the result. This produces a very irregular sequence, 12, 10, 1, 46, 2, 2, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7, 10, 9, 13, 25, 5, 24, 1, 42, ...  It would be nice to understand this better.
