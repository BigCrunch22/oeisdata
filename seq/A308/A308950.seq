%N A308950 Number of ways to write n as (p-1)/6 + 2^a*3^b, where p is a prime, and a and b are nonnegative integers.
%C A308950 Conjecture: Let r be 1 or -1. Then, any integer n > 1 can be written as (p-r)/6 + 2^a*3^b, where p is a prime, and a and b are nonnegative integers; in other words, 6*n+r can be written as p + 2^k*3^m, where p is a prime, and k and m are positive integers.
%C A308950 We have verified this for all n = 2..10^9.
%C A308950 Conjecture verified up to n = 10^11. - _Giovanni Resta_, Jul 03 2019

%e A308950 a(2) = 1 since 2 = (7-1)/6 + 2^0*3^0 with 7 prime.
%e A308950 a(3) = 2 since 3 = (13-1)/6 + 2^0*3^0 = (7-1)/6 + 2^1*3^0 with 13 and 7 prime.
