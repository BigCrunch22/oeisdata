%N A308764 Table read by antidiagonals: T(n,k) is the smallest prime that differs from its predecessor and successor by 2n and 2k, respectively.
%C A308764 If two consecutive primes p and q appear in the table, then the column number in which p appears is the row number in which q appears. E.g., 23 is in column 3 and 29 is in row 3, 29 is in column 1 and 31 is in row 1, 113 is in column 7 and 127 is in row 7, 3643 is in column 8 and 3659 is in row 8.
%C A308764 Nonzero terms on the main diagonal are the terms of A054342.
%H A308764 Jon E. Schoenfield, <a href="/A308764/b308764.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..5050</a> (first 100 antidiagonals, flattened)
%F A308764 T(n,k)=0 if n == k (mod 3) !== 0 (mod 3), with the exception of T(1,1)=5.
%e A308764 T(1,1)=5 because 5 is the only prime p whose predecessor and successor primes are p-2 and p+2, respectively (i.e., 3 and 7).
%e A308764 T(7,2)=127 because 127 is the smallest prime p whose predecessor and successor primes are p-14 and p+4, respectively (i.e., 113 and 131).
%e A308764 T(2,2)=0: the only set of three numbers {p-4, p, p+4} that are all prime is the set {3, 7, 11}, but these are not consecutive primes. (For every set of three integers {m-4, m, m+4}, exactly one of the three is divisible by 3.)
