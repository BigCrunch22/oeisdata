%N A308115 Rhythmic numbers: each number in this list is the least common multiple of some set of numbers S such that 1 is in S and every element of S except for 1 is a sum of two other elements of S.
%C A308115 ---------------------------Rhythmic structure example:---------------------------Enunciation: aababbccdbfe. Legend: a-a; b-aa; c-ba; d-bb; e-cc; f-db; g-fe. Unfolding: g (fe) (db)e db(cc) (bb)bcc bbb(ba)(ba) (aa)(aa)(aa)(aa)a(aa)a. "a" is a time unity. Each letter lasts the time of the sum of two others. The least common multiple of all letters is 12 (= a(6) in the sequence). This structure may represent alternated musical measures of 3/4 6/8.
%C A308115 Equivalently, this sequence corresponds to numbers that are the least common multiple of the terms of some addition chain. - _Rémy Sigrist_, May 23 2019

%Y A308115 The present sequence is a subset of A174973 and the first 22 terms are equal. With divisors of 88 (= A174973(23)) we can't make any of 11, 22, 44, 88 adding two of 1, 2, 4, 8.
