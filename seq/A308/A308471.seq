%N A308471 Lowest outliers for A057660.
%C A308471 A057660(n) is a multiplicative function bounded above by n*(n-1)+1, which is reached whenever n is 1 or prime. These numbers are the n such that the ratio between A057660(n) and the upper bound reaches a record low.
%C A308471 Motivated by _Daniel Forgues_'s conjecture that this sequence consists of 4 and A051451.
%C A308471 A subsequence of A025487.
