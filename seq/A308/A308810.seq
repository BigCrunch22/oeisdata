%N A308810 Odd positive integers k such that the repetend of the binary representation of 1/k contains more 1's than 0's.
%C A308810 The first prime in the sequence is 937. If a prime number p occurs in the sequence, then the repetend of the binary representation of 1/p is necessarily of odd length.
%e A308810 For example, 1/187 = 0.[0000000101011110011101011011101110001101]_2, where the bracketed repetend includes 21 ones and 19 zeros. Therefore, 187 is in the sequence.
