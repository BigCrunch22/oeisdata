%N A308478 a(n) = sum of the dimensions of the rational spans of all connected chord diagrams with n chords and any number m of link components, modulo all instances of the 4T-relation.
%C A308478 These numbers were generated as part of a proof of the dimensionality of the larger space of disconnected chord diagrams modulo 4T, and the code/combinatorics are provided in the paper.
%C A308478 At the time, computation was an issue but now it's likely the methods could be used to generate more terms. No generating function is known.
