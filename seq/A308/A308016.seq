%N A308016 The terms of A308007 appear to lie on two lines; set a(n) = 0 if A308007(n) is on the lower line (defined by A308009(n) <= n), a(n) = 1 if it is on the upper line (defined by a(n) >= n).
%C A308016 The first six terms of A308007 lie on both lines, so a(n) for n <= 6 is both 0 and 1.
%C A308016 More than the usual number of terms are given in order to show the irregularities.
%C A308016 It is only a (strong) conjecture that the terms of A308007 line on two lines. Certainly this is true for the first million terms.
