%e A308406 The "central digit" of 1 is 1, of course. The central digit of 100 is 0, the central digit of 123 is 2, etc. Reading the successive central digits of the successive terms produces 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, sequence, which are exactly the successive digits of the sequence itself.
%Y A308406 Cf. A308407 (the same idea, but with terms having an even number of digits).
