%N A308653 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct composite numbers such that for any n > 0, gcd(a(n), a(n+1)) > lpf(a(n)) (where lpf = A020639).
%C A308653 A more explicit (but longer) Name is:  a(1) = 4. For n > 1, a(n) is the composite determined as follows:  exclude smallest divisor > 1 of a(n-1), and of the remaining divisors > 1 select one such that a(n) is the smallest composite number not yet in the sequence that has this divisor in common with a(n-1).
%C A308653 By definition of the sequence, the divisors of a(n-1) used to determine a(n) are either primes or powers of primes.
%e A308653 The smallest divisor (greater than 1) of a(1) = 4 is 2, hence an allowed divisor is 4 and a(2) = 8.
%e A308653 The smallest divisor (greater than 1) of a(3) = 12 is 2, hence allowed divisors are 4 and 3.  If 4 is chosen a(4) = 16, and if 3 is chosen, a(4) = 6.  Hence 3 is chosen and a(4) = 6.
%e A308653 Of the allowed divisors of a(n-1), not always the smallest one is chosen to determine a(n).  For example, a(25) = 40, so the smallest divisor greater than 1 is 2, and allowed divisors are 4 and 5.  If 4 is chosen, a(26) = 48, and if 5 is chosen, a(26) = 35, so 5 is chosen and a(26) = 35.
