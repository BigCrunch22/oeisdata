%N A308561 Numbers with no 0 digit that are divisible by the sum of any two of their digits at distinct positions.
%C A308561 Without the constraint of having no digit 0, the terms would be much more dense, cf. A308560.
%e A308561 12 is divisible by 1 + 2 = 3, but 11 is not divisible by 1 + 1.
%e A308561 1512 is divisible by 1 + 5 = 6, 1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3 and 5 + 2 = 7.
%e A308561 For single-digit numbers there is no such sum and therefore no divisibility condition, so they are in the sequence.
%o A308561 (PARI) is(n,d=digits(n))={vecmin(d)&&n>9&&0==n%lcm(concat(vector(-1+n=#d,i,t=d[1+n-i];vector(n-i,j,t+d[j]))))}
%Y A308561 Cf. A308560, A308534.
