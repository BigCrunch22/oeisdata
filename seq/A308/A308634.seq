%N A308634 Number of triangle-free acyclic digraphs (or DAGs) up to isomorphism with n vertices, maximum indegree 2 and unique maximal element.
%e A308634 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 1 and a(3) = 2 coincide with the first three terms of A001190, as all connected triangle-free DAGs with at most three vertices are necessarily trees.
%e A308634 For n = 4, the a(4) = 5 solutions are the following three trees:
%e A308634 (((())))
%e A308634 ((), (()))
%e A308634 (((), ()))
%e A308634 together with two 4-cycles.
%Y A308634 Lower-bounded by A001190.
