%S A308657 3,10,178
%N A308657 Smallest number that is nontrivially palindromic in n consecutive number bases.
%C A308657 Nontrivially palindromic means having at least 2 digits in the palindromic base representation.

%e A308657 a(1) = 3 because it is the smallest nontrivial palindrome in some number base: 11 when written in binary.
%e A308657 a(2) = A279092(1) = 10 because it is the smallest nontrivial palindrome in two consecutive number bases, namely, bases 3 and 4: 101 and 22 when written in those number bases, respectively.
%e A308657 a(3) = A279093(1) = 178 since it can be written as a palindrome, in three consecutive number bases, and it is the smallest such number. Those bases are 6, 7, 8 and those representations are 454, 343, 262.
