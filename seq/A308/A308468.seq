%N A308468 "Trapezoidal numbers": numbers k such that the integers from 1 to k can be arranged in a trapezoid of H lines containing respectively L, L-1, L-2, ..., L-H+1 numbers from top to bottom. The rule is that from the second line, each integer is equal to the absolute value of the difference between the two numbers above it.
%C A308468 These numbers are called "nombres trapéziens" in French.
%C A308468 Some results from the article by "Diophante" (problème A352):
%C A308468 The powers of 2 are not trapezoidal.
%C A308468 Every odd number >= 3 is trapezoidal. In the case of k = 2m+1, a pattern can always be obtained with a trapezoid of height H = 2. The first line has the m+1 odd integers and the second the m even integers decreasing from 2m to 2, with this following arrangement:
%C A308468 1      2m+1        3        2m-1         5        ...
%C A308468    2m       2m-2      2m-4        2m-6      ...          2
%C A308468 If H = L, the trapezoid becomes a triangle (examples for 3, 6 and 10 that are triangular numbers but 28 is not in trapezoid).
%C A308468 When an integer is trapezoidal, the number of ways for this to happen varies greatly; up to 30, the number of distinct solutions is greater when k is multiple of 6. Two symmetric trapezoids are considered to be identical.
%C A308468 It is not known if this sequence has a finite number of even terms.
%C A308468 If 34 is trapezoidal then the only possible trapezoid is necessarily of the form L = 10 and H = 4, and,
%C A308468 if 36 is trapezoidal, there are only two possible trapezoid forms, the first has L = 8 and H = 8 (it is a triangle) and the second one has L = 13 and H = 3.
