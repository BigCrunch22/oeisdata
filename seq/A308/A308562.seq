%N A308562 Squares visited a knight moving on a board numbered by Hilbert's space-filling curve and moving to the lowest-numbered available unvisited square at each step.
%C A308562 Like the trapped knights problem (A316667 and A316588), but starting in the corner of a board numbered by Hilbert's space-filling curve.
%C A308562 The knight traps itself after only 22 moves (checked manually).
%Y A308562 A316667 and A316588 inspired the idea.
