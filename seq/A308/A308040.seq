%N A308040 Numbers k such that k - prevprime(k-1) is prime where prevprime(n) is the largest prime < n.
%C A308040 Contains all odd numbers k >= 5 such that k - 2 is prime.
%C A308040 If Goldbach's conjecture is true, the sequence contains an even number k iff there exists a Goldbach partition of k that includes the largest prime < k - 1. This sequence agrees with A014091 (numbers that are the sum of two primes) up to k = 96, but does not include 98 since the largest prime strictly below 97 is 89, which is paired with 9 (and thus, not a Goldbach partition).
