%N A308050 a(n) = n - prevprime(n - 1), where prevprime(n) is the largest prime < n.
%C A308050 a(n) is the smallest part appearing in the single partition of n into two parts whose largest prime part is < n - 1.

%F A308050 a(n) = n - A151799(n - 1).
%e A308050 a(11) = 4; 11 has 5 partitions into 2 parts: (10,1), (9,2), (8,3), (7,4) and (6,5). The single partition containing the largest prime part < 10 is (7,4) and 4 is the smallest part in this partition, so a(11) = 4.
