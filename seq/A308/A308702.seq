%N A308702 a(n) is the least integer k such that both k^2+2*n-1 and k^2+4*n are squares.
%C A308702 Motivated by the following original problem: the population of a city is a square number. With 100 more people, it would be a square plus one, with again 100 more people it would be a square. What is the initial population of the city? Answer: 2401. See Images des Mathématiques link.
%C A308702 One remarks that one can solve the problem when the population increase is even and greater than 1. So in the sequence definition, 2*n is the population increase and k^2 is the initial population.
%C A308702 One also notes that a(n) always exists with a(n) <= n-1.

%e A308702 For n=2, that is a population increase of 4, the population is 1 (a square), since we have 1+4-1 = 4 (a square) and 1+8 = 9 (a square).
%e A308702 For n=28, that is a population increase of 56, the population is 9 (a square), since we have 9+56-1 = 64 (a square) and 9+112 = 121 (a square).
