%N A308884 Follow along the squares in the square spiral (as in A274641); in each square write the smallest nonnegative number that a knight placed at that square cannot see.
%C A308884 Similar to A274641, except that here we consider the mex of squares that are a knight's moves rather than queen's moves.
%C A308884 Since there are at most 4 earlier cells in the spiral at a knight's move from any square, a(n) <= 4.

%e A308884 A knight at square 0 cannot see any numbers, so a(0)=0. Similarly a(1)=a(2)=a(3)=0.
%e A308884 A knight at square 4 in the spiral can see the 0 in square 1 (because square 1 is a knight's move from square 4), so a(4) = 1. Similarly a(5)=a(6)=1.
%e A308884 A knight at square 7 can see a(2)=0 and a(4)=1, so a(7) = mex{0,1} = 2.
%e A308884 And so on. See the illustration for the start of the spiral.
