%N A353322 A variant of Van Eck's sequence where we only consider powers of 2: for n >= 0, if a(n) = a(n-2^e) for some e, take the least such e and set a(n+1) = 2^e; otherwise a(n+1) = 0. Start with a(1) = 0.
%C A353322 The sequence is eventually 8-periodic.
%C A353322 The variant with powers of 4 is 3-periodic: (0 0 1)*.
%H A353322 <a href="/index/Rec#order_08">Index entries for linear recurrences with constant coefficients</a>, signature (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1).

%e A353322 a(1) = 0 by definition.
%e A353322 a(2) = 0 as there is only one occurrence of a(1) = 0 so far.
%e A353322 a(3) = 2^0 = 1 as a(2) = a(2-2^0).
