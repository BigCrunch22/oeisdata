%N A353773 Decimal expansion of the gravitational acceleration generated at a vertex by a unit-mass regular octahedron with edge length 2 in units where the gravitational constant is G = 1.
%C A353773 The absolute value of the gravitational attraction force between a homogeneous regular octahedron with mass M and edge length 2*s and a test particle with mass m located at the octahedron's vertex is c*G*M*m/s^2, where G is the gravitational constant (A070058) and c is this constant.
%C A353773 The vertices are the positions where the gravitational field that is generated by the octahedron on its surface attains its minimum absolute value.
