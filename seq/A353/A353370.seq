%N A353370 a(n) = 1 if the prime factorization of n contains as many even as odd prime indices, when counted with multiplicity, otherwise 0.
%C A353370 This is the characteristic function of A325698, see comments there.

%F A353370 a(p) = 0 for all primes p.
%F A353370 a(n) = a(A003961(n)) = a(A348717(n)), for all n >= 1.
%F A353370 If a(x)+a(y) > 0, then a(x*y) = a(x)*a(y).
%e A353370 For n = 84 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 7 the condition is satisfied, because it has two instances of odd-indexed primes (A031368), namely (2*2), and also two instances (3 and 7) of the even-indexed primes (A031215), therefore a(84) = 1.
