%N A353173 Dimension of space of invariants of n-th tensor power of the 26-dimensional fundamental (or "standard") irreducible representation of F_4.
%C A353173 It is known that a(n) satisfies a linear recurrence relation with polynomial coefficients. The limit of a(n+1)/a(n) is 26.
%H A353173 MathOverflow, <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/96149/invariants-for-the-exceptional-complex-simple-lie-algebra-f-4">Invariants for the exceptional complex simple Lie algebra F4</a>
%e A353173 a(1)=0 because there is no F_4-invariant linear form on the 26-dimensional representation; a(2)=1 because there is, up to scalars, precisely one invariant quadratic form.
%o A353173 (LiE) p_tensor(n,[0,0,0,1],F4)|[0,0,0,0] # Returns the value of a(n).
%Y A353173 The analogous sequence for the (52-dimensional) adjoint representation of F_4 is: A179685.
%Y A353173 A similar sequence for G_2 (for its 7-dimensional fundamental irreducible representation) is: A059710.
%Y A353173 A similar sequence for B_2 (for its standard 5-dimensional irreducible representation) is: A095922.
%Y A353173 For A_n the similar sequence (omitting some 0's) is given by the (n+1)-dimensional Catalan numbers, e.g., A005789 for A_2.
