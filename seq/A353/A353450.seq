%N A353450 T(n,m) is the number of non-congruent quadrilaterals with integer vertex coordinates (x1,1), (n,y2), (x3,m), (1,y4), 1 < x1, x3 < n, 1 < y2, y4 < m, m <= n, such that the 6 distances between the 4 vertices are distinct and (x3-x1)*(y4-y2) < 0, where T(n,m) is a triangle read by rows.
%C A353450 Property "(x3-x1)*(y4-y2) < 0" holds iff the diagonals (spokes) of the quadrilateral are concurrent, i.e., their slopes are both positive or both negative. In this case the spokes are tilted in a different sense: clockwise and counterclockwise (see example). The framed quadrilateral may be classified as "contrasense" iff (x3-x1)*(y4-y2) < 0.
%C A353450 All quadrilaterals of A353532 are classified according to the sign of the product (x3-x1)*(y4-y2) as "all" = "unisense" (> 0) + "contrasense" (< 0) + "static" (= 0). The distinction is invariant under symmetry.
