%N A353621 Side c of primitive integer-sided triangles (a, b, c) whose angle B = 3*C.
%C A353621 The triples (a, b, c) are displayed in increasing order of side b, and if sides b coincide then in increasing order of side c; hence, this sequence of sides c is not increasing.
%C A353621 In the case B = 3*C, the corresponding metric relation between sides is c*a^2 = (b-c)^2 * (b+c).
%C A353621 Equivalently, length of side opposite to the angle that is one-third of another one, for primitive integer-sided triangles.
%C A353621 All terms are cubes >= 8 (A000578). More generally, when c is the side of a primitive integer-sided triangles (a, b, c) whose angle B = m*C, then c = k^m, for some k >= 2.
%C A353621 Note that side c is never the largest side of the triangle.

%F A353621 a(n) = A353618(n, 3).
%e A353621 According to inequalities between a, b, c, there exist 3 types of such triangles:
%e A353621 a < c < b with the middle side c = 8 of the first triple (3, 10, 8).
%e A353621 c < a < b with the smallest side c = 27 of the 2nd triple (35, 48, 27).
%e A353621 c < b < a with the smallest side c = 216 of the 8th triple (539, 510, 216), the first of this type.
%e A353621 The smallest side c for which there exist two distinct triangles with B = 3*C is for a(4) = a(5) = 125, and these sides c belong respectively to triples (112, 195, 125) and (279, 280, 125).
