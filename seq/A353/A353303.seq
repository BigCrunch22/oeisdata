%e A353303 Divisors of 16 are [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]. When we apply A156552 to them, we obtain [0, 1, 3, 7, 15], of which only 0, 3 and 15 are multiples of three, therefore only factorizations 1*16 and 4*4 of 16 are counted, therefore a(16) = 2.
%e A353303 792 has 24 divisors in total, but only d = [1, 4, 9, 22, 36, 66, 88, 198, 264, 792] are such that A156552(d) is a multiple of 3. When using them, the following five factorizations are possible: 792 = 4*198 = 9*88 = 22*36 = 4*9*22, therefore a(792) = 5.
