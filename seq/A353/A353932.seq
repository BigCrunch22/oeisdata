%N A353932 Irregular triangle read by rows where row k lists the run-sums of the k-th composition in standard order.
%C A353932 Every sequence can be uniquely split into a sequence of non-overlapping runs. For example, the runs of (2,2,1,1,1,3,2,2) are ((2,2),(1,1,1),(3),(2,2)), with sums (4,3,3,4).
%C A353932 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
