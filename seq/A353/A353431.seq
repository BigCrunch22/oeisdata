%N A353431 Numbers k such that the k-th composition in standard order is empty, a singleton, or has its own run-lengths as a subsequence (not necessarily consecutive) that is already counted.
%C A353431 First differs from A353696 (the consecutive version) in having 22318, corresponding to the binary word 101011100101110 and standard composition (2,2,1,1,3,2,1,1,2), whose run-lengths (2,2,1,1,2,1) are subsequence but not a consecutive subsequence.
%C A353431 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
