%N A353090 Column -2 of the extended Trithoff (tribonacci) array.
%C A353090 This column is also called the pre-seed of the Trithoff array.
%C A353090 This is a nondecreasing sequence containing all nonnegative integers, with some of them doubled and some tripled. The doubled numbers are the positions of the letter "c" in the tribonacci word (A003146). Correspondingly, the tripled numbers are positions of letters "a" and "b" in the tribonacci word.
%C A353090 Suppose number n_1 has tribonacci representation t that ends in 1 (such numbers are in column 1 of the Trithoff array). Then its tribonacci successor n_2 has tribonacci representation t0 (such numbers are in column 2 of the Trithoff array), and the successor of the successor n_3 has tribonacci representation t00 (such numbers are in column 3 of the Trithoff array). The pre-seed in the same row as n_1, n_2, and n_3 is 2n_1-n_2.
