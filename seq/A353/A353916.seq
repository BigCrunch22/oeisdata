%N A353916 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2. Let j = a(n-1) and let m = omega(gcd(j, k)) with gcd(j, k) > 1. For n > 2, a(n) = least k such that min(omega(j), omega(k)) = m and m < max(omega(j), omega(k)).
%C A353916 Let P = the set of distinct prime divisors of j = a(n-1), and let Q = the set of distinct prime divisors of k = a(n). Let g = gcd(j, k) > 1 and let G = {P intersect Q}. Noncoprime j and k implies |G| > 0. This sequence is such that |G| > 0, |P| > |G|, and |Q| == |G|, or vice versa.
%C A353916 Coprimality and equality are forbidden, forcing primes into divisibility. Because of this, a(i) = mp -> a(i+1) = p -> a(i+2) = sp, with composite m and s not powers of p > 2. For n > i, multiples of p including powers may appear in the sequence. Consequently, odd primes enter the sequence late.
%C A353916 Numbers m that immediately precede and follow prime p have omega(m) > 1.
%C A353916 For any adjacent pair of terms with n > 1, if one is prime then the other cannot be a power of that prime, since such a pair would have the same number of distinct prime divisors.
%C A353916 This sequence requires an asymmetric version of the relation of j and k seen in A337687. In that sequence, we have P != Q, |P| > |G| and |Q| > |G|, therefore we have symmetry in that there is at least 1 prime p | j that does not divide k, and at least 1 prime q | k that does not divide j. That sequence occurs among composites m with omega(m) > 1, but this sequence admits primes, since, for |G| = 1, we must have |P| or |Q| equal to 1, and there is no prohibition for multiplicity to exceed 1.
%C A353916 A353917 is a version of this sequence that prohibits divisibility, hence primes do not appear, but composite prime powers do.
%C A353916 Open question: do the primes appear in order? (They do for n <= 2^16).
