%N A353011 Indices of "late birds" in A090395 (denominator of d(n)/n): indices n such that A090395(k) > A090395(n) for all k > n.
%C A353011 A090395(n) is the denominator of d(n)/n, where d = A000005 is the number of divisors.
%C A353011 The present sequence gives the indices of those terms of A090395 such that all subsequent terms are larger. This can be used to verify whether a number N is in A091896, which lists the numbers that don't occur in A090395.
%C A353011 It appears that a(n) is divisible by 12 for all n >= 2, by 5 for all n >= 18, by 24 (thus by 120) for all n > 23. Can somebody prove this?
%F A353011 a(n+1) > a(n).
