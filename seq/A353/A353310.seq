%N A353310 Number of terms encountered when iterating A353313, before reaching the first term that is a part of a finite cycle, or -1 if no finite cycle is ever reached.
%F A353310 a(n) = A353311(n) - A353312(n).
%e A353310 For n = 1, when iterating with A353313, we obtain 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 3 -> 1 -> etc, thus 1 itself is included in the closed cycle, and therefore a(1) = 0.
%e A353310 For n = 6, when iterating with A353313, we obtain 6 -> 2 -> 5 -> ..., and after 103 more iterations we obtain 5 again (see examples in A353311 and A353312), thus only the two initial numbers, 6 and 2 are outside of the final closed cycle, therefore a(6) = 2.
