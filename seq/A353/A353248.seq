%N A353248 Irregular table, read by rows, where row n is the concatenation of all prime signatures leading to n divisors, in reverse lexicographic order.
%C A353248 The number-of-divisors function d = A000005 is multiplicative with d(p^e) = e+1. Therefore, a prime signature (e1, e2, ..., eN) which yields a given number of divisors corresponds to a factorization (e1+1)*...*(eN+1) of that number. Following the usual convention, we only consider prime signatures with decreasing exponents (e1 >= e2 >= ... >= eN). Furthermore, we list them in reverse lexicographic order, i.e., largest e1 first, etc.
%C A353248 The sequence starts with row 1 which has length 0 (the only number having only 1 divisor is 1 which has the empty product as prime factorization), so the first term a(1) = 1 is the first element of row 2. Here and thereafter, the first element of row n is easily recognized as the first occurrence of n-1, which is the only element of the row (and therefore followed by n) iff n is prime.
