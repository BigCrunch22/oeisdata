%N A353193 The row numbers of the Trithoff (tribonacci) array that don't correspond to difference sequences of other rows of the Trithoff array.
%C A353193 All positive tribonacci-like sequences are in the Trithoff array.
%C A353193 Every tribonacci-like sequence s is a difference sequence of another tribonacci-like sequence t, where t is uniquely defined. If s is an integer sequence then, t doesn't have to be an integer sequence. If t is an integer sequence, then the row number corresponding to sequence s is not in this sequence.
%C A353193 These are the Trithoff array rows that repeat a pattern: even, even, odd, odd.
%e A353193 The first row of the Trithoff array is the sequence of tribonacci numbers A000073. Its differences form sequence A001590, which is the second row of the Trithoff array. Thus, 2 is not in this sequence.
%e A353193 The tribonacci sequence, the first row of the Trithoff array, is the difference sequence of the tribonacci-like sequence A000213 divided by 2. The result is not an integer sequence. Thus, 1 is in this sequence.
%Y A353193 Complement of A353178.
%Y A353193 Cf. A000073, A000213, A001590, A136175.
