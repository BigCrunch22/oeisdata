%N A353353 Number of ways to write n as a product of the terms of A332820 larger than 1; a(1) = 1 by convention (an empty product).
%C A353353 Number of factorizations of n into factors k > 1 for which A048675(k) is a multiple of three.

%F A353353 a(p) = 0 for all primes p.
%e A353353 Of the eight divisors of 36 larger than 1, [2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36], only 6 and 36 are in A332820, and because these allow two different factorizations as 36 = 6*6, we have a(36) = 2.
