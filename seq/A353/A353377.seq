%N A353377 Number of ways to write n as a product of the terms of A345452 larger than 1; a(1) = 1 by convention (an empty product).
%C A353377 Number of factorizations of n into factors k > 1 for which there is an even number of primes (when counted with multiplicity, A001222) in their prime factorization, and the 2-adic valuation of k (A007814) is also even.

%F A353377 For all n >= 1, a(n) <= A353337(n).
%e A353377 Of the 19 divisors of 240 larger than 1, the following: [4, 15, 16, 60, 240] are found in A345452. Using them, we can factor 240 in four possible ways, as 240 = 60*4 = 16*15 = 15*4*4, therefore a(240) = 4.
%e A353377 Of the 23 divisors of 540 larger than 1, the following: [4, 9, 15, 36, 60, 135, 540] are found in A345452. Using them, we can factor 540 in five possible ways, as 540 = 135*4 = 60*9 = 36*15 = 15*9*4, therefore a(540) = 5.
