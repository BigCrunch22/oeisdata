%N A353862 Greatest run-sum of the prime indices of n.
%C A353862 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798.
%C A353862 A run-sum of a sequence is the sum of any maximal consecutive constant subsequence.
%e A353862 The prime indices of 72 are {1,1,1,2,2}, with run-sums {3,4}, so a(72) = 4.
