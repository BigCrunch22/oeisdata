%N A353696 Numbers k such that the k-th composition in standard order (A066099) is empty, a singleton, or has run-lengths that are a consecutive subsequence that is already counted.
%C A353696 First differs from the non-consecutive version A353431 in lacking 22318, corresponding to the binary word 101011100101110 and standard composition (2,2,1,1,3,2,1,1,2), whose run-lengths (2,2,1,1,2,1) are a subsequence but not a consecutive subsequence.
%C A353696 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
