%N A353855 Last term of the trajectory of the composition run-sum transformation (condensation) of the n-th composition in standard order.
%C A353855 Every sequence can be uniquely split into a sequence of non-overlapping runs. For example, the runs of (2,2,1,1,1,3,2,2) are ((2,2),(1,1,1),(3),(2,2)), with sums (4,3,3,4). The run-sum trajectory is obtained by repeatedly taking the run-sum transformation (A353847) until the rank of an anti-run is reached. For example, the trajectory 11 -> 10 -> 8, corresponding to (2,1,1) -> (2,2) -> (4), has last term a(11) = 8.
%C A353855 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%e A353855 The trajectory 139 -> 138 -> 136 -> 128 ends with a(139) = 128.
