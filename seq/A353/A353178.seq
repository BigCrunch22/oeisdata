%N A353178 The row numbers of the Trithoff (tribonacci) array that correspond to difference sequences of other rows of the Trithoff array.
%C A353178 All positive tribonacci-like sequences are in the Trithoff array.
%C A353178 Every tribonacci-like sequence s is a difference sequence of another tribonacci-like sequence t, where t is uniquely defined. If s is an integer sequence then, t doesn't have to be an integer sequence. If t is an integer sequence, then the row number corresponding to sequence s is in this sequence.
%C A353178 These are the Trithoff array rows that are all odd, or all even, or alternate between even and odd.
%e A353178 The first row of the Trithoff array is the sequence of tribonacci numbers A000073. Its differences form sequence A001590, which is the second row of the Trithoff array. Thus, 2 is in this sequence.
%e A353178 The tribonacci sequence, the first row of the Trithoff array, is the difference sequence of the tribonacci-like sequence A000213 divided by 2. The result is not an integer sequence. Thus, 1 is not in this sequence.
%Y A353178 Complement of A353193.
%Y A353178 Cf. A000073, A000213, A001590, A136175.
