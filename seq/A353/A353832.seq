%N A353832 Heinz number of the multiset of run-sums of the prime indices of n.
%C A353832 The sequence of runs of a sequence consists of its maximal consecutive constant subsequences when read left-to-right. For example, the runs of (2,2,1,1,1,3,2,2) are (2,2), (1,1,1), (3), (2,2), with sums (4,3,3,4).
%C A353832 The Heinz number of a partition (y_1,...,y_k) is prime(y_1)*...*prime(y_k). This gives a bijective correspondence between positive integers and integer partitions.
%C A353832 This sequence represents the transformation f(P) described by Kimberling at A237685.
