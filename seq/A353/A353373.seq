%N A353373 Number of ways to write n as a product of the terms of A325698 larger than 1; a(1) = 1 by convention (an empty product).
%C A353373 Number of factorizations of n into factors k > 1 for which there are equal number of odd-indexed primes (A031368) as there are even-indexed primes (A031215) in their prime factorization.

%F A353373 a(p) = 0 for all primes p.
%F A353373 a(n) = a(A003961(n)) = a(A348717(n)), for all n >= 1.
%e A353373 Of the 23 divisors of 936 larger than 1, only [6, 26, 36, 156, 936] are in A325698. These can be combined to yield a product yielding 936 in four possible ways as 936 = 156*6 = 36*26 = 26*6*6, therefore a(936) = 4.
%e A353373 Of the 31 divisors of 2184 larger than 1, only [6, 14, 26, 84, 156, 364, 2184] are in A325698. These can be combined to yield a product yielding 2184 in five possible ways as 2184 = 364*6 = 156*14 = 84*26, therefore a(2184) = 5.
