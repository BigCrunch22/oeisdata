%N A353082 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not appeared that is a divisor of (a(n-1) + a(n-2))*|a(n-1) - a(n-2)|.
%C A353082 The sequence is finite, the final term being a(160)=143. See the examples. The maximum value is a(110)=35941 while the fixed points are 1, 2, 3, 8, 11, 67.
%e A353082 a(6) = 9 as (a(5)+a(4))*|a(5)-a(4)| = (4+5)*|4-5| = 9, and 9 is the smallest unused number that is a divisor of 9. This is the first term that differs from A353006.
%e A353082 a(159) = 144, a(160) = 143. Therefore a(161) would be the smallest unused number that divides (143+144)*|143-144| = 287. The divisors are 1, 7, 41, 287, all of which have already appeared, so the sequence terminates.
