%N A353848 Numbers k such that the k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) has all equal run-sums.
%C A353848 Every sequence can be uniquely split into non-overlapping runs, read left-to-right. For example, the runs of (2,2,1,1,1,3,2,2) are ((2,2),(1,1,1),(3),(2,2)), with sums (4,3,3,4).
%C A353848 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.

%e A353848 For example:
%e A353848 - The 59th composition in standard order is (1,1,2,1,1), with run-sums (2,2,2), so 59 is in the sequence.
%e A353848 - The 2298th composition in standard order is (4,1,1,1,1,2,2), with run-sums (4,4,4), so 2298 is in the sequence.
%e A353848 - The 2346th composition in standard order is (3,3,2,2,2), with run-sums (6,6), so 2346 is in the sequence.
