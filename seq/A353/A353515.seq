%N A353515 The length of the shortest path from n to 1 when using the transitions x -> A003415(x) and x -> A003961(x), or -1 if no 1 can ever be reached from n.
%C A353515 This is a variant of A327969 that seems to be less in need of an escape clause. Note that enough prime shifts with A003961 will eventually transform every term of A100716 (which is a subsequence of A099309) to a term of A048103, and that A051903(A003961(n)) = A051903(n). See also the array A344027.
%C A353515 Records 0, 1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, ... occur at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 128, 256, 768, 1024, 2048, 4096, ..., etc.

%F A353515 a(1) = 0, a(p^p) = 1 + a(A003961(p^p)) for primes p, and for other numbers, a(n) = 1 + min(a(A003415(n)), a(A003961(n))).
%F A353515 a(p) = 1 for all primes p.

%e A353515 From n = 4, we can reach 1 with just four steps as A003961(4) = 9, A003415(9) = 6, A003415(6) = 5 and A003415(5) = 1, and because there are no shorter paths we have a(4) = 4.
%e A353515 From n = 8, we can reach 1 with seven steps, as A003415(8) = 12, A003961(12) = 45, A003415(45) = 39, A003961(39) = 85, A003415(85) = 22, A003415(22) = 13, A003415(13) = 1, and because there are no shorter paths we have a(8) = 7.
%e A353515 For n = 15, as A003415(15) = 8, we know that a(15) is at most a(8)+1, i.e., 8. But we can do better, as A003961(15) = 35, A003961(35) = 77, A003415(77) = 18, A003415(18) = 21, A003415(21) = 10, A003415(10) = 7, A003415(7) = 1, and because there are no shorter paths we have a(15) = 7.
%e A353515 From n = 49, we can reach 1 in four steps, as A003961(49) = 121, A003415(121) = 22, A003415(22) = 13, A003415(13) = 1. Note that this is less than A099307(49)-1, as it would take 5 steps to reach 1 if using the arithmetic derivative only, 49 -> 14 -> 9 -> 6 -> 5 -> 1.
