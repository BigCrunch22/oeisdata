%N A353917 a(1) = 4. Let j = a(n-1) and let m = omega(gcd(j, k)) with gcd(j, k) > 1. For n > 1, a(n) = least k such that min(omega(j), omega(k)) = m and m < max(omega(j), omega(k)), but neither j | k nor k | j.
%C A353917 The sequence exhibits phases involving alternating composite prime powers and squarefree semiprimes. These manifest in log-log scatterplot in a caustic fashion, where the composite prime power is very much larger than the squarefree semiprime for sufficiently large n.
%C A353917 Let P = the set of distinct prime divisors of j = a(n-1), and let Q = the set of distinct prime divisors of k = a(n). Let g = gcd(j, k) > 1 and let G = {P intersect Q}. Noncoprime j and k implies |G| > 0. This sequence is such that |G| > 0, |P| > |G|, and |Q| == |G|, or vice versa, yet neither j | k nor k | j.
%C A353917 Theorem: primes are prohibited. Proof: since we have gcd(j, k) > 1 and do not allow divisibility, and since primes must either divide or be coprime to another number m, primes do not appear in this sequence.
%C A353917 Theorem: squarefree semiprimes j = pq are followed by k = p^2 or k = q^2. Proof: since omega(j) = |P| = 2 and is squarefree, we have 2 cases pertaining to successor k, both with gcd(j, k) > 1.
%C A353917 1.) |P| == |G| implies |Q| > |G| and |Q| > |P|.
%C A353917 2.) |Q| == |G| implies |P| > |G| and |P| > |Q|.
%C A353917 The first case implies some prime r | k yet gcd(j, r) = 1. But this would require j | k, which is prohibited. The second case suggests either p | k or q | k, but so as to satisfy non-divisibility axiom, we are forced into either k = p^e, e > 1, or k = q^m, m > 1.
%C A353917 Corollary: powers of the same prime appear in natural order in this sequence.
%C A353917 There is a weaker alternation between numbers in A120944 and A350352 as n is sufficiently large. This alternation exhibits prime power factor features akin to the composite prime power-squarefree semiprime alternation.
%C A353917 Conjecture: permutation of composite numbers.
