%N A353861 Number of distinct weak run-sums of the prime indices of n.
%C A353861 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798.
%C A353861 A weak run-sum of a sequence is the sum of any consecutive constant subsequence.
%e A353861 The prime indices of 72 are {1,1,1,2,2}, with weak runs {}, {1}, {1,1}, {1,1,1}, {2}, {2,2}, which have sums 0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 4, of which 5 are distinct, so a(72) = 5.
