%N A353323 A variant of Van Eck's sequence where we only consider powers of 3: for n >= 0, if a(n) = a(n-3^e) for some e, take the least such e and set a(n+1) = 3^e; otherwise a(n+1) = 0. Start with a(1) = 0.
%C A353323 Will every power of 3 appear in the sequence?
%e A353323 a(1) = 0 by definition.
%e A353323 a(2) = 0 as there is only one occurrence of a(1) = 0 so far.
%e A353323 a(3) = 3^0 = 1 as a(2) = a(2-3^0).
%e A353323 a(4) = 0 as there is only one occurrence of a(3) = 1 so far.
%e A353323 a(5) = 3^1 = 3 as a(4) = a(4-3^1).
%e A353323 a(6) = 0 as there is only one occurrence of a(5) = 3 so far.
%e A353323 a(7) = 0 as a(6) <> a(6-3^e) for any admissible e.
%e A353323 a(8) = 3^0 = 1 as a(7) = a(7-3^0).
%e A353323 a(9) = 0 as a(8) <> a(8-3^e) for any admissible e.
