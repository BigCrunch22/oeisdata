%C A353905 The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers. In the first 100000 terms the number 18869 holds the record for the greatest number of terms for which it is the lowest unseen number, 4769 terms in all. In the same range there are fifteen fixed points, the last being a(1204), and it is likely no more exist.
