%N A353062 Non-prime-powers k such that sigma(k^2) is divisible by d(k^2), where d = A000005, sigma = A000203; non-prime-powers k such that k^2 is in A003601.
%C A353062 Here prime powers means the numbers in A246655.
%C A353062 For p prime, p^(k-1) is a term in A003601 if and only if (p^k-1)/(p-1) is divisible by k. So this sequence is (A107924 U A107925) \ {p^((k-1)/2): p prime, k odd, k | (p^k-1)/(p-1)}.
%C A353062 It is standard that k does not divide 2^k-1 for k > 1, so no term > 1 in A003601 can be a power of 2, hence A107924 is a subsequence.
%C A353062 Since a,b in A003601 (resp. A107924 U A107925) and gcd(a,b) = 1 implies that a*b is in A003601 (resp. A107924 U A107925), this sequence is infinite. For example, all numbers of the form (p_1)*(p_2)*...*(p_k) are here, where p_i's are distinct primes congruent to 1 modulo 3, k >= 2.

%e A353062 91 is a term since sigma(91^2) = 10431 is divisible by d(91^2) = 9.
%e A353062 296 is a term since sigma(296^2) = 178689 is divisible by d(296^2) = 21. 296 is the smallest term that is not a product of coprime numbers > 1 in A107924 U A107925.
%e A353062 999 is a term since sigma(999^2) = 1537851 is divisible by d(999^2) = 21. 999 is the smallest odd term that is not a product of coprime numbers > 1 in A107924 U A107925.
