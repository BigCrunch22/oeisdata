%N A353936 a(n) is the n-th highly composite number (A002182) divided by the smallest highly composite number with at least half as many divisors, or 0 if the quotient is not an integer.
%C A353936 This sequence has infinitely many prime terms and infinitely many composite terms.
%e A353936 a(8) = 4 because A002182(8) = 48 has 10 divisors and the smallest highly composite number with at least 10/2 = 5 divisors is 12, and 48/12 = 4.
%e A353936 a(49) = 0 because A002182(49) = 14414400 has 504 divisors and the smallest highly composite number with at least 504/2 = 252 divisors is 1081080, and 14414400/1081080 equals 40/3, which is not an integer.
