%N A353201 a(n) = smallest m such that f(m,x) is divisible by g(n,x), where f(m,x) = U(m-1,x/2), and U(k,x) is the k-th Chebyshev polynomial of the second kind over the field GF(2); g(n,x) is the polynomial over GF(2) whose coefficients correspond to the binary digits of n.
%C A353201 g(n,x) divides f(m,x) if and only if m is a multiple of a(n).

%e A353201 For n=13, g(13,x) = 1*x^3 + 1*x^2 + 0*x + 1 because 13 is 1101 in binary. f(7,x) is the smallest that is divisible by g(13,x), so a(13) = 7.
