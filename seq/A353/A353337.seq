%N A353337 Number of ways to write n as a product of the terms of A028260 larger than 1; a(1) = 1 by convention (an empty product).
%C A353337 Number of factorizations of n into factors k > 1 for which there is an even number of primes (when counted with multiplicity, A001222) in their prime factorization.

%F A353337 a(n) = a(A046523(n)). [The sequence depends only on the prime signature of n].
%F A353337 For all n >= 1, a(n) >= A320655(n), and a(n) >= A353377(n).
%e A353337 Of the eleven divisors of 96 larger than one, the following: [4, 6, 16, 24, 96] are terms of A028260 because they have an even number of prime factors when counted with repetition. Using them, we can factor 96 in four possible ways, as 96 = 24*4 = 16*6 = 6*4*4, therefore a(96) = 4.
