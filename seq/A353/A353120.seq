%N A353120 (a) Write down all the natural integers on a single row S, starting with 1; (b) start reading S from the very beginning of S; (c) if a single digit d stands between two digits having the same parity, lift d and add it to the digit immediately to its right; (d) go back to (a). The sequence is the end result of this procedure.
