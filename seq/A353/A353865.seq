%N A353865 Number of complete rucksack partitions of n. Partitions whose weak run-sums are distinct and cover an initial interval of nonnegative integers.
%C A353865 Every sequence can be uniquely split into a sequence of non-overlapping runs. For example, the runs of (2,2,1,1,1,3,2,2) are ((2,2),(1,1,1),(3),(2,2)), with sums (4,3,3,4). A weak run-sum is the sum of any consecutive constant subsequence.
%C A353865 Do all positive integers appear only finitely many times in this sequence?
%e A353865 The a(n) compositions for n = 1, 3, 9, 15, 18:
%e A353865   (1)  (21)   (4311)       (54321)            (543321)
%e A353865        (111)  (51111)      (532221)           (654111)
%e A353865               (111111111)  (651111)           (7611111)
%e A353865                            (81111111)         (111111111111111111)
%e A353865                            (111111111111111)
%e A353865 For example, the weak runs of y = {7,5,4,4,3,3,3,1,1} are {}, {1}, {1,1}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {3,3}, {7}, {4,4}, {3,3,3}, with sums 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, which are all distinct and cover an initial interval, so y is counted under a(31).
