%N A353083 The second column of the Trithoff (tribonacci) array.
%C A353083 These are the numbers whose tribonacci representation ends in 10.
%C A353083 This is a subsequence of A003145: Numbers in this sequence indicate positions of letter b in the tribonacci word, but not all such positions.
%e A353083 The first few tribonacci numbers are 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24. The number 43 can be represented as 24+13+4+2. Thus, its tribonacci representation is 110110, and 43 is in this sequence.
%Y A353083 Cf. A000073, A003145, A003265, A136175, A353084, A353086, A353090.
