%C A353167 From _Kevin Ryde_, Jul 22 2022: (Start)
%C A353167 Integers with an even number of 1-bits at even positions, and an even number of 1-bits at odd positions, and so all k with A355487(k) = 0.
%C A353167 Among four integers 4*i ..4*i+3, exactly one is a term here so that a(n) can be calculated by appending two bits to n-1 to ensure the two 1-bit counts are even, so a(n) = 4*(n-1) + A355487(n-1).
