%N A353159 Integers k for which there exists some integer m such that the sum of the digits of m^k is equal to m + k.
%C A353159 Letting t = m^k, this sequence consists of the integers k for which there exists some integer m such that s(t) = m + k, where s(t) = A007953(t) represents the sum of digits of t. Rearranging gives m = t^(1/k) = s(t) - k; this allows you to find numbers which follow a common online trick like 64^(1/2) = (6 + 4) - 2 or 216^(1/3) = (2 + 1 + 6) - 3. This online trick was the original motivation for this sequence.

%F A353159 For any given k, the value of m is bounded by 0 < m < x, where x is the maximum solution to the equation x = 10^(1/k)*k*floor(9*log_10(x)-1).
%e A353159 s(62^9) = 62 + 9, so 9 is a term.
%e A353159 s(2157^156) = 2157 + 156, so 156 is a term.
%e A353159 s(18045^999) = 18045 + 999,  so 999 is a term.
