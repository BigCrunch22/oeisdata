%N A353838 Numbers whose prime indices have all distinct run-sums.
%C A353838 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798.
%C A353838 The sequence of runs of a sequence consists of its maximal consecutive constant subsequences when read left-to-right. For example, the runs of (2,2,1,1,1,3,2,2) are (2,2), (1,1,1), (3), (2,2), with sums (4,3,3,4).
%e A353838 The prime indices of 180 are {1,1,2,2,3}, with run-sums (2,4,3), so 180 is in the sequence.
%e A353838 The prime indices of 315 are {2,2,3,4}, with run-sums (4,3,4), so 315 is not in the sequence.
