%N A120776 Composite numbers k such that k+d+1 is prime for all divisors d of k greater than 1.
%C A120776 The sequence could begin with 1 by convention. The sequence in which d can be 1 is a subsequence. The elements are assumed composite so as to exclude the Sophie Germain primes (A005384) and (A045536). All terms except 8 and 9 are odd numbers in squarefree semiprimes (A006881) or 3-almost-primes (A014612). The only square is 9, the first few cubes are 8, 125, 357911=71^3, 6967871=191^3 and the first few 3-almost primes are 935=5*11*17, 1859=11*13^2, 11123=7^2*227, 305015=5*53*1151. The first 3-almost-prime divisible by 9 is 149049=3^2*16561. All elements not divisible by 3 are 5 or 11 mod 12. I have been unable to find an element with more than 3 prime factors. If one exists, it must be very large. One reason is that the number of divisors grows rapidly with the number of factors. For example, if n is squarefree with k factors, then tau(n)=2^k. The condition that the 2^k-1 numbers n+d+1 be prime is then quite strong. Another reason is that one or more of the numbers n+d+1 may always be composite. For example, if n=p^5, p prime, then both p^5+p^4+1 and p^5+p+1 are composite.
