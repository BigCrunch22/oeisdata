%N A120837 a(n) = the smallest positive integer which does not occur earlier in the sequence and which is coprime to the number of positive divisors of n.
%C A120837 Sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A120837 Scatterplot shows trajectories of odd numbers, even numbers that are not 3 smooth, 3 smooth numbers that are not 5 smooth, etc. - _Michael De Vlieger_, Oct 12 2024

%e A120837 6 has 4 positive divisors. Among those positive integers not occurring among the first 5 terms of the sequence, 9 is the smallest which is coprime to 4. So a(6) = 9. 4, 6 and 8 also do not occur among the first 5 terms of the sequence, but they are not coprime to 4.
