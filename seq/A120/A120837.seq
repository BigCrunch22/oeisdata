%N A120837 a(n) = the smallest positive integer which does not occur earlier in the sequence and which is coprime to the number of positive divisors of n.
%C A120837 Sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.
%e A120837 6 has 4 positive divisors. Among those positive integers not occurring among the first 5 terms of the sequence, 9 is the smallest which is coprime to 4. So a(6) = 9. 4, 6 and 8 also do not occur among the first 5 terms of the sequence, but they are not coprime to 4.
