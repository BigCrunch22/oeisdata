%N A120873 Fractal sequence of the Wythoff difference array (A080164).
%C A120873 A fractal sequence f contains itself as a proper subsequence; e.g., if you delete the first occurrence of each positive integer, the remaining sequence is f; thus f properly contains itself infinitely many times.
%C A120873 This is subsequence of A003603. - _Clark Kimberling_, Oct 26 2021
%C A120873 a(n) is the number of the row of the Wythoff array (A035513) that contains the n-th Wythoff pair; e.g., the 6th Wythoff pair is (floor(6*r), floor(6*r^2)), where r = golden ratio = A001622, which is in row 4 of the Wythoff array. - _Clark Kimberling_, Oct 26 2021

%e A120873 The fractal sequence f(n) of a dispersion D={d(g,h,)} is defined as follows.
%e A120873 For each positive integer n there is a unique (g,h) such that n=d(g,h) and f(n)=g. So f(7)=2 because the row of the WDA in which 7 occurs is row 2.
