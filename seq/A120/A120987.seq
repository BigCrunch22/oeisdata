%N A120987 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of ternary words of length n with k strictly increasing runs (0 <= k <= n; for example, the ternary word 2|01|12|02|1|1|012|2 has 8 strictly increasing runs).
%C A120987 Sum of entries in row n is 3^n (A000244).
%C A120987 Sum of entries in column k is A099464(k+1) (a trisection of the tribonacci numbers).
%C A120987 Row n contains 1 + floor(2n/3) nonzero terms.
%C A120987 T(n,n) = (n+1)*(n+2)/2 (the triangular numbers (A000217)).
%C A120987 Sum_{k=0..n} k*T(n,k) = (2n+1)*3^(n-1) = 3*A081038(n-1) for n >= 1.
%C A120987 T(n,k) = A120987(n,n-k).

%F A120987 T(n,k) = trinomial(n+1,3n-3k+2) = trinomial(n+1,3k-n) (conjecture).
%F A120987 G.f.: 1/(1-3tz-3t(1-t)z^2-t(1-t)^2*z^3).
%F A120987 Can anyone prove the conjecture (either from the g.f. or combinatorially from the definition)?
%F A120987 From _Giuliano Cabrele_, Mar 02 2008: (Start)
%F A120987 The conjecture is compatible with the g.f., which can be rewritten as (1-t)/(1-t(1+(1-t)z)^3) and expanded to give T(n,k) = Sum_{j=0..k} (-1)^(k-j)*C(3j, n)*C(n+1, k-j) = Sum_{j=0..k} (-1)^j*C(n+1,j)*C(3k-3j,n) = trinomial(n+1,3k-n) = A027907(n+1,3k-n).
%F A120987 Also (1-t)/(1-t(1+(1-t)z)^2) equals the g.f. for the case of binary words, A119900, where Sum_{j=0..k} (-1)^(k-j)*C(2j,n)*C(n+1,k-j) = C(n+1,2k-n). Changing the exponent to 1 gives 1/(1-zt), the g.f. for the case of unary words, the expansion coefficients of which can be written as Kronecker delta(k-n)^(n+1) = Sum_{j=0..k} (-1)^(k-j)*C(j, n)*C(n+1,k-j).
%F A120987 So the conjecture shifts to that the g.f. is (1-t)/(1-t(1+(1-t)z)^m) and coefficients T(m,n,k) = Sum_{j=0..k} (-1)^(k-j)*C(mj,n)*C(n+1, k-j) may apply to the general case of m-ary words. (End)
