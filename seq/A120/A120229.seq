%N A120229 Split-floor-multiplier sequence (SFMS) using multipliers 1/3 and 3. The SFMS using multipliers r and s is here introduced: for every positive integer n and positive real number r, let [rn] abbreviate floor(rn). Then SFMS(r, s), where max {r, s} > 1, is the sequence a defined by a(n)=[rn] if [rn] > 0 and is not already in a and a(n) = [sn] otherwise.
%C A120229 Self-inverse permutation of the natural numbers.

%F A120229 a(n) = [n/3] if this is positive and new, otherwise a(n)=3n.
%e A120229 a(1) = 1*3 because [1/3] is not positive.
%e A120229 a(2) = 2*3 because [2/3] is not positive.
%e A120229 a(3) = 1 = [3*(1/3)].
%e A120229 a(4) = 4*3 because [4/3] = a(3), not new.
