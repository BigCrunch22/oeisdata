%N A120094 Rows of Pascal's triangle which contain no terms numerically adjacent to odd primes (the 1's at either end are of course numerically adjacent to the even prime 2).
%C A120094 Apart from the (2^i-1)-th rows, there are no obvious divisibility properties that would explain the coincidence. '1' is the 0th row.
%e A120094 The 7th, 15th, 31st, ... (2^i-1)-th rows are all included as Pascal's triangle only contains odd terms, thus all numerically adjacent terms are even.
%o A120094 (PARI) for(n=2, 1000, for(k=1, n\2, ok=1; c=binomial(n, k); if(ispseudoprime(c+1)||ispseudoprime(c-1), ok=0; break; )); if(ok,print1(n, ", ")))
%Y A120094 Cf. A007318.
