%N A120063 Shortest side c of all integer-sided triangles with sides a<=b<=c and inradius n.
%C A120063 Terms a(11),..., a(100) computed by Thomas Mautsch (mautsch(AT)ethz.ch).
%C A120063 Empirically, 2*sqrt(3) < a(n)/n <= 5. The lower bound is provably tight, the upper bound seems to be achieved infinitely often, e.g, for prime n >= 5. It appears that a(p) = 5p for prime p != 3. - _David W. Wilson_, Jun 17 2006
%C A120063 Minimum of longest side occurring among all A120062(n) triangles having integer sides with integer inradius n.

%e A120063 a(1)=5 because the only triangle with integer sides and inradius 1 is {3,4,5}; its longest side is 5.
%e A120063 a(2)=10: The triangles with inradius 2 are {5,12,13}, {6,8,10}, {6,25,29}, {7,15,20}, {9,10,17}. The minimum of their longest sides is min(13,10,29,20,17)=10.
