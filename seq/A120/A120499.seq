%N A120499 Irregular triangle read by rows in which the n-th row consists of the positive integers which are <= n and divisible by exactly one prime dividing n (but are coprime to every other prime dividing n). (a(1) = 1).
%C A120499 n-th row of array has A116512(n) terms.
%H A120499 Michael De Vlieger, <a href="/A120499/b120499.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..10589</a> (rows 1 <= n <= 250)
%e A120499 12 is divisible by the primes 2 and 3. 2,3,4,8,9,10 are those positive integers which are <= 12, which are divisible by 2 or 3, but are not divisible by 2 and 3. So the 12th row of the array is {2,3,4,8,9,10}.
