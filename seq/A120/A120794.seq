%N A120794 Numerators of partial sums of Catalan numbers scaled by powers of -1/16.
%C A120794 From the expansion of sqrt(1+1/4) = 1+(1/8)*Sum_{k>=0} C(k)/(-16)^k one has, with the partial sums r(n) are defined below, r := lim_{n->oo} r(n) = 4*(sqrt(5)-2) = 4*(2*phi-3) = 0.944271909...
%C A120794 Denominators coincide with the listed numbers of A120785 but may differ for higher n values.
%C A120794 This is the first member (p=1) of the fourth family of scaled Catalan sums with limits in Q(sqrt(5)). See the W. Lang link under A120996.
