%N A120370 a(1) = 2. a(n) = a(n-1) + (maximum number of distinct primes dividing any earlier terms).
%e A120370 210 follows 207 in the sequence because the greatest number of distinct primes dividing any earlier terms of the sequence is 3.
%e A120370 210 in the sequence is followed by 214 because 4 distinct primes divide 210, the first term of the sequence divisible by 4 distinct primes.
