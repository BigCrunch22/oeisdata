%N A120386 Number of isomers of polyhex hydrocarbons with C_(2h) symmetry with nineteen hexagons.
%C A120386 See Table 4 column 3 on page 615 of the paper by Caporossi and Hansen. Also the sequence starts for the hydrocarbon C_54H_18. If the number of carbons is an odd number then the number of isomers with this symmetry is zero.

%e A120386 If the number of carbons is 56 then the number of isomers of polyhex hydrocarbons with C_(2h) symmetry with nineteen hexagons is 3 which is the third term in the sequence.
