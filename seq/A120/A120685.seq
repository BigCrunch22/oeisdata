%N A120685 Integers m such that the sequence defined by f(0)=m and f(n+1)=1+gpf(f(n)), with gpf(n) being the greatest prime factor of n (A006530), ends up in the repetitive cycle 4 -> 3 -> 4 -> ...
%C A120685 Let f(0)=m; f(n+1)=1+gpf(f(n)), where gpf(n) is the greatest prime factor of n (A006530). For any m, for sufficiently large n the sequence f(n) oscillates between 3 and 4. Given a sufficiently large n, this allows us to divide integers in two classes: C3 (m such that the sequence f(n) enters the cycle 3, 4, 3, ...) and C4 (m such that the sequence f(n) enters the cycle 4, 3, 4, ...). We present here C4 as the one that begin with 4. In A120684 we present C3 as the one that begin with 3.
%e A120685 Oscillation between 3 and 4: 1+gpf(3)=1+3=4; 1+gpf(4)=1+2=3.
%e A120685 Other value, e.g. 7: 1+gpf(7)=1+7=8; 1+gpf(8)=1+2=3 (7 belongs to C3).
%e A120685 Other value, e.g. 20: 1+gpf(20)=1+5=6; 1+gpf(6)=1+3=4 (20 belongs to C4).
