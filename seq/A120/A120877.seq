%N A120877 a(1) = 1. a(n) = number of earlier terms of the sequence that divide the sum of the earlier terms of the sequence.
%C A120877 Sum of first n terms of this sequence is A120878(n).

%e A120877 The sum of the first 9 terms of the sequence is 27. Among the first 9 terms of the sequence there are 4 terms (a(1)=1, a(2)=1, a(4)=3, a(6)=3) which divide 27.
%e A120877 So a(10) = 4.
