%N A120217 Start with 100057 and repeatedly reverse the digits and add 2 to get the next term.
%C A120217 Let T(S,Q) be the sequence obtained by starting with S and repeatedly reversing the digits and adding Q to get the next term. This is T(100057,2). 100057 is the first S for which T(S,2) reaches a cycle of length 945. The cycle is simply the first 945 terms, which then repeat. A full period is given in the table.
