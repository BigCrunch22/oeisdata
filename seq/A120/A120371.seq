%N A120371 Number of isomers of polyhex hydrocarbons with C_(2h) symmetry with eighteen hexagons.
%C A120371 See Table 3 column 3 on page 614 of the paper by Caporossi and Hansen. Also the sequence starts for the hydrocarbon C_52H_18. If the number of carbons is an odd number then the number of isomers with this symmetry is zero.

%e A120371 If the number of carbons is 54 then the number of isomers of polyhex hydrocarbons with C_(2h) symmetry with eighteen hexagons is 14 which is the third term in the sequence.
