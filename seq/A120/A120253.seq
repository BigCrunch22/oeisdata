%N A120253 Number of subsets of integers in the interval [n^2+1, (n+1)^2-1] whose product is twice a square.
%C A120253 Also the number of subsets in the same interval whose product is precisely a square, if 1 is included.

%F A120253 a(n) = 2^A120254(n).
%e A120253 a(5) = 2 because the interval [26,35] contains two sets of such integers: {32} and {27,28,30,35}.
%Y A120253 Cf. A120254. A099500 is the number of distinct products which are twice a square. A099501 is the smallest size of a subset which is twice a square.
