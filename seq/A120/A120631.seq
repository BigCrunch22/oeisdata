%N A120631 Decimal equivalent of A066329.
%C A120631 There is some ambiguity here: Should 1 be made as 10 or 01? Should 5 be made as 1000 or 0111? The terms here choose 01 and 1000 respectively. The original author did not give a term for 10, so I do not know if 1111 should be considered a valid string (using both 5s) or not. I assumed it was valid in extending the sequence.
%Y A120631 Cf. A066329 for the binary version and a fuller description of this sequence.
