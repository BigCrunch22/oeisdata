%N A120629 Numbers k with property that -k is not a perfect power and the squarefree part of -k is not congruent to 1 modulo 4.
%C A120629 According to a famous 1927 conjecture of Emil Artin, modified by Dick Lehmer, these negative numbers are primitive roots modulo each prime of a set whose density among primes equals Artin's constant (see A005596). The positive numbers with the same property are given by A085397.

%e A120629 -3 and -12 are not in the set because their squarefree parts are equal to -3, which is congruent to 1 modulo 4. -32 is not in the set because it is the fifth power of -2. -1 is excluded because it is an odd power of -1.
