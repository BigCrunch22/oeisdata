%N A120411 If A is a set of integers, the (2-fold) sumset consists of all the numbers which can be written as the sum of two (not necessarily distinct) elements in A. a(n) is the number of subsets of [1,2n] which are sumsets for some set of positive integers.
%C A120411 The relation a(n+1)-a(n) = A190820(n) seems to hold. - _Giovanni Resta_, Jan 15 2013
%e A120411 a(5)=30 because two of the 31 (nonempty) subsets of [1,5], namely {1,2,4,5} and {1,2,3,4,5} have the sumset {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10} and no two other subsets of [1,5] have the same sumset.
