%N A120402 a(1)=2; a(n)=first even number greater than a(n-1) such that 2*a(n)-1 is prime and a(i)+a(n)-1 is prime for all 1<=i<=n-1.
%C A120402 All elements after the first are 4 mod 6. In base 12 the sequence is 2, 4, X, 5X, 2EX, 244X, 420XX, 208E24, 38082X, 2798084, where X is 10 and E is eleven.
%F A120402 a(1)=2; a(n) = s where s is the first even number s>a(n-1) such that 2*s-1 is prime and s+a(i)-1 is prime, 1<=i<=n-1.
%e A120402 a(2)=4 since 4 is the first even number > a(1)=2 such that 2*4-1=7 is prime and 4+2-1=5 is prime.
