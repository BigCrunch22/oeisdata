%N A120988 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of binary trees with n edges and such that the first leaf in the preorder traversal is at level k (1<=k<=n). A binary tree is a rooted tree in which each vertex has at most two children and each child of a vertex is designated as its left or right child.
%C A120988 Row sums are the Catalan numbers (A000108). T(n,1)=A000108(n-1) for n>=2 (the Catalan numbers). T(n,n)=2^n. Sum(k*T(n,k),k=1..n)=A120989(n).
%F A120988 T(n,k)=Sum(j*binomial(k,j)*binomial(2n-2k+j,n-k)/(2n-2k+j), j=0..k). G.f.=1/[1-tz(1+C)], where C=[1-sqrt(1-4z)]/(2z) is the Catalan function.
