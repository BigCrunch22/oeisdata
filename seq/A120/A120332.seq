%N A120332 If n is among earlier terms of sequence, then replace each prime power in the prime-factorization of n with the next lower prime-power to get a(n). If n is not among earlier terms of sequence, then replace each prime power in the prime-factorization of n with the next higher prime-power to get a(n).
%C A120332 Sequence is a permutation of the positive integers and is its own inverse permutation.
%e A120332 6 (= 2*3) is not among the first 5 terms of the sequence. So for a(6) we want the prime powers closest to and larger than 2 and 3, which are 3 and 4. So a(6) = 3*4 = 12. Therefore 12 (=2^2 *3) does occur among the first 11 terms of the sequence. So for a(12) we want the product of the prime powers closest to and less than 2^2 and 3, which are 3 and 2. So a(12) = 3*2 = 6.
