%N A120335 CRF(13): consecutive refactorable numbers (rf, rf-1 are refactorable) such that 13 is the smallest prime divisor of rf.
%C A120335 The sequence has prime factorization (13*197)^12, (13*1093)^12, (13*1733)^12, (13*17*139)^12, (13*7877)^12, (13*16069)^12.
%F A120335 a(n) = is the n-th number rf such that both rf and rf-1 are refactorable and 13 is the smallest prime divisor of rf.
%e A120335 a(1)=(13*197)^12 is the first number rf such that rf refactorable, 13 is the smallest prime of rf and rf-1 is refactorable.
