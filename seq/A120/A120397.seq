%N A120397 Minimal number of steps needed to represent a prime >=5 as a sum of at most 3 primes such that all the previous odd primes are represented.
%C A120397 This sequence contains probably every natural number, though this should be checked further. Conjecture: Every prime >=5 can be represented as a sum of at most 3 primes, such that all the previous odd primes are represented.
