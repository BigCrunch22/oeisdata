%N A120436 Complete list of numbers that can be represented both as a product of 2 consecutive integers and as a product of 3 consecutive integers.
%C A120436 Mordell shows that the only integer points on the elliptic curve y*(y+1) = x*(x+1)*(x+2) have x = -2, -1, 0, 1, 5, corresponding to the products 0, 6, 210. However, there are infinitely many rational points generated from (x,y) = (0,0) by the chord-and-tangent process. - _Jonathan Sondow_, Oct 12 2013
