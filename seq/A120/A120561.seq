%N A120561 Numbers n such that Lucas(prime(n)) is prime, where Lucas = A000032.
%C A120561 All prime Lucas numbers A000032[n] have indices that are prime, zero or a power of 2. It is a conjecture that all indices of prime Lucas numbers are prime, except n = 0, 4, 8, 16.
%C A120561 Indices of prime Lucas numbers are listed in A001606[n] = {0,2,4,5,7,8,11,13,16,17,19,31,37,41,47,53,61,...}.
