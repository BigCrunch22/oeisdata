%N A120215 Start with 1057 and repeatedly reverse the digits and add 2 to get the next term.
%C A120215 Let T(S,Q) be the sequence obtained by starting with S and repeatedly reversing the digits and adding Q to get the next term. This is T(1057,2). 1057 is the first S for which T(S,2) reaches a cycle of length 45. The cycle is simply the first 45 terms, which then repeat. A full period is shown.
