%N A120401 Construct the sequence given by the floor of the imaginary part of zeros of the Riemann zeta function; take complement.
%C A120401 Complement to A013629. Similar to A002410 and A122526, which use "round" instead of "floor".
%e A120401 The first zero is 14.13472.. so 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 are part of the sequence.
%e A120401 The second zero is 21.02203.. so 15,16,17,18,19,20 are in the sequence too.
%e A120401 The third zero is 25.0108.. so we get 22,23,24, etc.
