%N A331218 a(n) is the numbers of ways to write n = u + v where the decimal representations of u and of v have the same number of digits d for d = 0..9.
%C A331218 In other words, a(n) is the number of ways to write n as the sum of two anagrams.
%C A331218 Leading zeros are ignored.

%e A331218 For n = 44:
%e A331218 - we have the following ways to write 44 as a sum of two anagrams:
%e A331218   u   v
%e A331218   --  --
%e A331218   13  31
%e A331218   22  22
%e A331218   31  13
%e A331218 - hence a(44) = 3.
