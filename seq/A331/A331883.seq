%N A331883 The number of permutations in the symmetric group S_n in which it is possible to find two disjoint increasing subsequences each with length equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence of the permutation.
%C A331883 Only permutations whose longest increasing subsequence is at most n/2 need to be considered.
%H A331883 Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_increasing_subsequence_problem">Longest increasing subsequence problem</a>
%e A331883 a(3) = 1 because the only permutation whose longest increasing subsequence is 1 is [3,2,1] and this contains two disjoint increasing subsequences of length 1.
%e A331883 The a(4) = 5 permutations are:
%e A331883   [2,1,4,3],
%e A331883   [2,4,1,3],
%e A331883   [3,1,4,2],
%e A331883   [3,4,1,2],
%e A331883   [4,3,2,1].
