%N A331592 a(n) is the smaller of the number of terms in the factorizations of n into (1) powers of distinct primes and (2) powers of squarefree numbers with distinct exponents that are powers of 2.
%C A331592 See A329332 for a description of the relationship between the two factorizations. From this relationship we get the formula a(n) = min(A001221(n), A001221(A225546(n))).
%C A331592 The result depends only on the prime signature of n.
%C A331592 k first appears at A191555(k).

%F A331592 a(n) = min(A001221(n), A331591(n)) = min(A001221(n), A001221(A293442(n))).
%F A331592 a(A225546(n)) = a(n).
%F A331592 a(A003961(n)) = a(n).
%F A331592 a(n^2) = a(n).
%e A331592 The factorization of 6 into powers of distinct primes is 6 = 2^1 * 3^1 = 2 * 3, which has 2 terms. Its factorization into powers of squarefree numbers with distinct exponents that are powers of 2 is 6 = 6^(2^0) = 6^1, which has 1 term. So a(6) is min(2,1) = 1.
%e A331592 The factorization of 40 into powers of distinct primes is 40 = 2^3 * 5^1 = 8 * 5, which has 2 terms. Its factorization into powers of squarefree numbers with distinct exponents that are powers of 2 is 40 = 10^(2^0) * 2^(2^1) = 10^1 * 2^2 = 10 * 4, which has 2 terms. So a(40) is min(2,2) = 2.
