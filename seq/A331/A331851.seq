%N A331851 a(n) is the number of distinct values obtained by partitioning the binary representation of n into consecutive blocks, and then multiplying the numbers represented by the blocks.
%C A331851 This sequence is a variant of A321318.

%e A331851 For n = 6:
%e A331851 - the binary representation of 6 is "110",
%e A331851 - we can split it in 4 ways:
%e A331851       "110" -> 6
%e A331851       "1" and "10" -> 1*2 = 2
%e A331851       "11" and "0" -> 3*0 = 0
%e A331851       "1" and "1" and "0" -> 1*1*0 = 0
%e A331851 - we have 3 distinct values,
%e A331851 - hence a(6) = 3.
