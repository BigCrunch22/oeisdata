%N A331411 Position of the start of a 5-digit sequence in the decimal digits of Pi such that the first, third, and fifth terms of that 5-digit sequence are the same.
%e A331411 The five decimal digits of Pi starting at the 412th digit are {5,7,5,9,5}. Because the first, third, and fifth of those five digits are the same, 412 is a term of the sequence.
