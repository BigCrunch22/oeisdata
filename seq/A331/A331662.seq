%e A331662 9 is a term since the binary representations of its divisors, 1, 3 and 9, are palindromic: 1, 11 and 1001, i.e., the binary reversals of themselves.
%e A331662 95 is a term since the binary representations of its divisors, 1, 5, 19 and 95, are 1, 101, 10011 and 1011111, and their binary reversals, 1, 101, 11001, 1111101, or  1, 5, 25 and 125 in decimal representation, are the divisors of 125, which is the binary reversal of 95.
