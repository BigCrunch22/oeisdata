%N A331986 Number of snake-like polyominoes with the maximum possible number of unit squares in an n X n square.
%C A331986 The maximum possible number of unit squares is given by A331968(n).
%C A331986 Equivalently, a(n) is the number of maximum length paths without chords in the n X n grid graph. A path without chords is an induced subgraph that is a path.
%C A331986 For n > 1, a(n) is a multiple of 4 since a solution can have at most one symmetry considering rotations and reflections. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Feb 04 2020
