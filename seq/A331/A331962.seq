%N A331962 Triangle read by rows: row j lists j primes by ascending n bit bientropy (n >= 8).
%C A331962 Primes are sorted by the relative order and disorder of their n binary digits as measured by the bientropy function. When two or more primes have the same bientropy, their natural order is preserved.

%F A331962 Given a binary string s = s1...sn (where in this application n >= 8), there are n-1 binary derivatives of s, Dk(s), 1 <= k <= n-1.
%F A331962 The first binary derivative of s, D1(s), is the binary string of length n-1 formed by XORing adjacent pairs of digits of s.
%F A331962 We refer to the k-th derivative of s, Dk(s), as the binary derivative of Dk-1(s).
%F A331962 p(k) is the proportion of 1's in Dk.
%F A331962 D0 = s;
%F A331962 0*log_2(0) is defined to be 0;
%F A331962 C = 1/(2^(n-1)-1);
%F A331962 D = Sum_{k=0..n-2}(-p(k)*log_2(p(k))-(1-p(k))*log_2(1-p(k)))*2^k.
%F A331962 bientropy(s) = C*D;
%e A331962 For example, the 8-bit bientropy of 17 (a Fermat prime) is 0.0534 as, in binary, it is a periodic binary number - 00010001. The bientropy of 13 is 0.9532 as its binary digits - 00001101 are not periodic. Each row j reveals where the j-th prime sits relative to the rest given its bientropy.
