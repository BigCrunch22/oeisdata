%N A331380 Numbers whose sum of prime factors is divisible by their sum of prime indices.
%C A331380 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798.
%e A331380 The sequence of terms together with their prime indices begins:
%e A331380      2: {1}
%e A331380      4: {1,1}
%e A331380      8: {1,1,1}
%e A331380     16: {1,1,1,1}
%e A331380     32: {1,1,1,1,1}
%e A331380     33: {2,5}
%e A331380     39: {2,6}
%e A331380     55: {3,5}
%e A331380     64: {1,1,1,1,1,1}
%e A331380     65: {3,6}
%e A331380     66: {1,2,5}
%e A331380     74: {1,12}
%e A331380     77: {4,5}
%e A331380     78: {1,2,6}
%e A331380     86: {1,14}
%e A331380     91: {4,6}
%e A331380    110: {1,3,5}
%e A331380    128: {1,1,1,1,1,1,1}
%e A331380    130: {1,3,6}
%e A331380    132: {1,1,2,5}
%e A331380 For example, 132 has prime factors {2,2,3,11} and prime indices {1,1,2,5}, and 18 is divisible by 9, so 132 is in the sequence.
