%N A331813 a(n) is the least k > 1 such that k*A019278(n) belongs to A019278 too, or a(n) = 0 if no such k exists.
%C A331813 For the 132 terms (< 5*10^11) of the b-file for A019278, and using an extended list of terms, it can be checked that a(n) is not 0, even if the precise value is not known. For instance, a(51) <= 8097830664651.
%C A331813 Then a(52) to a(82) are: 4, 9, 1197, 8, 256, 4, 65155475, 64, 4096, 16, 195205791, 1387, 7, 37791, 4, 119, 8, 35136, 225, 64, 69127695, 2129920, 256, 4, 19671223, 9, 2, 1379763, 8, 90, 4096. And a(83) <= 7758260899200.
%C A331813 a(51) and a(83) are > 10^9.
%e A331813 With A019278 starting as 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 16, 21, 24, 42, 60, 64, ...
%e A331813 one gets the proper multiples 2, 4, 8, 16, 60, 64, ...
%e A331813 and so the sequence begins: 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, ...
%o A331813 (PARI) a(n, v019278) = my(m = v019278[n]); my(k=2, y = k*m); while (denominator(sigma(sigma(y))/y) != 1, k++; y += m); k;
%Y A331813 Cf. A019278 (integers m such that sigma(sigma(m))/m is an integer).
