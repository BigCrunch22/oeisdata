%N A331451 Triangle read by rows: Take an n-sided polygon (n>=3) with all diagonals drawn, as in A007678. Then T(n,k) = number of k-sided polygons in that figure for k = 3, 4, ..., n.

%F A331451 By counting edges in two ways, we have the identity Sum_k k*T(n,k) + n = 2*A135565(n). E.g. for n=7, 3*35+4*7+5*7+6*0+7*1+7 = 182 = 2*A135565(7).
%e A331451 A hexagon with all diagonals drawn contains 18 triangles, 6 quadrilaterals, and no pentagons or hexagons, so row 6 is [18, 6, 0, 0].
