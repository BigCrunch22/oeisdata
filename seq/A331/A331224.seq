%N A331224 Numerator of squared radius of circumscribed circle of a triangle with integer sides i <= j <= k, such that the number of triangles with this radius sets a new record. Denominators are A331225.
%F A331224 Squared radius of circumcircle of triangle with sides a, b, c:
%F A331224 R^2 = (a*b*c)^2 / (16*s*(s - a)*(s - b)*(s - c)) with s = (a + b + c)/2.
%e A331224 Correspondence of the first terms b(n) = a(n)/A331225(n) with triangles (i, j, k):
%e A331224 b(1) = 1/3: (1,1,1), start with 1 = A331226(1) triangle.
%e A331224 b(2) = 64/15: (2,3,4), (2,4,4) is the first occurrence of 2 = A331226(2) triangles with identical R.
%e A331224 b(3) = 49/3: (3,5,7), (3,7,8), (5,7,8), (7,7,7) is the first occurrence of more triangles with identical R than the previous record 2, new record is 4 = A331226(3).
%e A331224 b(4) = 1024/15: (5,8,12), (5,14,16), (8,8,14), (8,12,16), (8,16,16), (12,14,16) is the first occurrence of more triangles with identical R than the previous record 4, new record is 6 = A331226(4).
