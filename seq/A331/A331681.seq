%N A331681 One, two, and all numbers of the form 2^k * prime(j) where k > 0 and j already belongs to the sequence.
%C A331681 Also Matula-Goebel numbers of semi-lone-child-avoiding locally disjoint rooted semi-identity trees. A rooted tree is semi-lone-child-avoiding if there are no vertices with exactly one child unless the child is an endpoint/leaf. Locally disjoint means no branch of any vertex overlaps a different (unequal) branch of the same vertex. In a semi-identity tree, all non-leaf branches of any given vertex are distinct. Note that these conditions together imply that there is at most one non-leaf branch under any given vertex.
%C A331681 Also Matula-Goebel numbers of semi-lone-child-avoiding rooted trees with at most one non-leaf branch under any given vertex.
%C A331681 The Matula-Goebel number of a rooted tree is the product of primes indexed by the Matula-Goebel numbers of its branches (of the root), which gives a bijective correspondence between positive integers and unlabeled rooted trees.
