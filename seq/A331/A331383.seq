%N A331383 Number of integer partitions of n whose sum of primes of parts is equal to their product of parts.
%e A331383 The a(n) partitions for n = 7, 9, 18, 24:
%e A331383   (4,3)  (6,3)    (12,4,1,1)                 (19,4,1)
%e A331383          (4,4,1)  (11,4,1,1,1)               (18,4,1,1)
%e A331383                   (8,5,1,1,1,1,1)            (9,6,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1)
%e A331383                   (4,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1)
%e A331383 For example, (4,4,1) has sum of primes of parts 7+7+2 = 16 and product of parts 4*4*1 = 16, so is counted under a(9).
