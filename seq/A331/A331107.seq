%N A331107 The sum of Zeckendorf-infinitary divisors of n = Product_{i} p(i)^r(i): divisors d = Product_{i} p(i)^s(i), such that the Zeckendorf expansion (A014417) of each s(i) contains only terms that are in the Zeckendorf expansion of r(i).
%C A331107 First differs from A034448 at n = 16.
%H A331107 Amiram Eldar, <a href="/A331107/b331107.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..10000</a>
%F A331107 Multiplicative with a(p^e) = Product_{i} (p^s(i) + 1), where s(i) are the terms in the Zeckendorf representation of e (A014417).
%e A331107 a(16) = 27 since 16 = 2^4 and the Zeckendorf expansion of 4 is 101, i.e., its Zeckendorf representation is a set with 2 terms: {1, 3}. There are 4 possible exponents of 2: 0, 1, 3 and 4, corresponding to the subsets {}, {1}, {3} and {1, 3}. Thus 16 has 4 Zeckendorf-infinitary divisors: 2^0 = 1, 2^1 = 2, 2^3 = 8, and 2^4 = 16, and their sum is 1 + 2 + 8 + 16 = 27.
