%N A331468 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct triples (A,B,C) such that A + B = C with A, B, C anagrams of each other and A < B.
%C A331468 The sequence is infinite as (10*A,10*B,10*C) is a legal triple if (A,B,C) is a legal triple.
%C A331468 From _Bernard Schott_, Jan 19 2020: (Start)
%C A331468 Theorem: Every term of this sequence is divisible by 9.
%C A331468 Proof: If m = digsum(A) = digsum(B) = digsum(C) where digsum = A007953, then A + B = C implies digsum(A) + digsum(B) == digsum(C) (mod 9), so 2*m == m (mod 9) and m == 0 (mod 9). (End)
%C A331468 The numbers of 3-digit to 8-digit triples are: 1, 25, 648, 17338, 495014, and 17565942. - _Hans Havermann_, Feb 02 2020

%e A331468 The first triple is (459,495,954) and we have 459 + 495 = 954, anagrams of each other;
%e A331468 The second triple is (1089,8019,9108) and we have 1089 + 8019 = 9108, anagrams of each other;
%e A331468 The third triple is (1089,8091,9180) and we have 1089 + 8091 = 9180, anagrams of each other;
%e A331468 The fourth triple is (1269,1692,2961) and we have 1269 +1692 = 2961, anagrams of each other; etc.
