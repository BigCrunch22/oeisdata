%N A331382 Numbers whose sum of prime factors is divisible by their product of prime indices.
%C A331382 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798.
%e A331382 The sequence of terms together with their prime indices begins:
%e A331382      1: {}
%e A331382      2: {1}
%e A331382      4: {1,1}
%e A331382      8: {1,1,1}
%e A331382     16: {1,1,1,1}
%e A331382     18: {1,2,2}
%e A331382     20: {1,1,3}
