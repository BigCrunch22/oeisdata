%N A331972 Bi-unitary highly touchable numbers: numbers m > 1 such that a record number of numbers k have m as the sum of the proper bi-unitary divisors of k.
%C A331972 The corresponding record values are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, ...
%C A331972 The bi-unitary version of A238895.

%e A331972 a(1) = 2 since it is the first number which is not the sum of proper bi-unitary divisors of any number.
%e A331972 a(2) = 6 since it is the least number which is the sum of proper bi-unitary divisors of one number: 6 = A331970(6).
%e A331972 a(3) = 8 since it is the least number which is the sum of proper bi-unitary divisors of 2 numbers: 8 = A331970(10) = A331970(12).
