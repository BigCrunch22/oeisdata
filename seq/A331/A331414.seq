%N A331414 Number of integral free trees of n vertices.
%C A331414 A tree (or graph) is integral when the roots of the characteristic polynomial of its adjacency matrix are all integers (so integer spectrum of that matrix).
%C A331414 Per Harary and Schwenk, a star comprising a vertex and n leaves around it has spectrum 0,+-sqrt(n).  This is integral when n is a square, so a(n^2+1) >= 1.  Brouwer made a computer search to find all integral trees up to 50 vertices, which gives values here to a(50), by reducing the search space with tests of Cauchy interlacing to eliminate branches.
