%N A331693 Number of Tom graphs with n vertices.
%C A331693 This sequence is from a Project Euler problem called "Tom and Jerry". A cat named Tom and a mouse named Jerry play a game on a graph G. Each vertex of G is a mousehole. Jerry starts in one of the vertices. Every day, Tom tries to catch Jerry in one of the holes. If there is a vertex adjacent to Jerry's hole, then Jerry moves to one of the adjacent holes. A Tom graph is a graph on which Tom can always catch Jerry by following a sequence of holes.
%C A331693 All Tom graphs are loop-free graphs, but not all loop-free graphs are Tom graphs. The smallest loop-free graph that is not a Tom graph has 10 vertices:

%C A331693 From _Hugo Pfoertner_, Feb 20 2020 (Start):
%C A331693 The sequence is an equivalent of A005195 (number of forests with n unlabeled nodes), but made from trees that don't have the unlabeled 10-node graph shown above as a subgraph. This is described in the comment of A300576 and there is also a link to Christian Perfect's website.
%C A331693 In order to find a term of the current sequence, the number of trees containing the shown subgraph must be subtracted from the total number A000055. For n = 10 this is exactly one, for n = 11 it is trivially 4 and for n = 12 it is 19 (A130132).
%C A331693 The marked illustrations from the Steinbach graph catalog show these manually counted tree graphs.
%C A331693 The formulas of A005195 (Euler transform) can then be used to calculate the number of forests if the reduced number of trees A130131 is used instead of A000055. (End)
%C A331693 a(0) = 1: the empty graph is a Tom graph, since Jerry cannot hide from Tom. - _Rainer Rosenthal_, Mar 01 2020
