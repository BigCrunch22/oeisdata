%N A331245 Triangles with integer sides i <= j <= k sorted by radius of enclosing circle, and, in case of ties, lexicographically by side lengths (smallest first). The sequence gives the middle side j. The other sides are in A331244 and A331246.
%C A331245 The enclosing circle differs from the circumcircle by limiting the radius to (longest side)/2 for obtuse triangles, i.e., those with i^2 + j^2 < k^2.
%e A331245 See A331244.
%Y A331245 Cf. A331244 (shortest side), A331246 (longest side).
