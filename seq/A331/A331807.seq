%N A331807 a(n) is the smallest prime number p > n, not yet in the sequence, such that p is a palindrome when written in base n.
%C A331807 Using a representation where the digits of the prime are written between "[" and "]_" separated by commas with the base following the "_" then by checking up to a base of 7000 (where the lowest prime palindrome is [1, 1]_7000):
%C A331807 1) Either the palindrome is [1, 1]_n where n is one less than a prime number, or [1, X, 1]_n where X << n, asymptotically.
%C A331807 2) A conjecture: No lowest primes need more than three digits.
%C A331807 3) The terms a(12) and a(30) differ from the similar sequence A331806 as these terms in A331806 are the same as the earlier terms a(3) and a(5).

%e A331807 a(2)=3 which is 11 in binary, a(3)=13 which is 111 in ternary, a(4)=5 which is 11 in quaternary, a(16)=17 which is 11 in hexadecimal.
%e A331807 If we use the representation described earlier, then:
%e A331807    a(2)  = 3    is [1, 1]_2,
%e A331807    a(3)  = 13   is [1, 1, 1]_3,
%e A331807    a(4)  = 5    is [1, 1]_4,
%e A331807    a(11) = 199  is [1, 7, 1]_11,
%e A331807    a(13) = 313  is [1, 11, 1]_13,
%e A331807    a(16) = 17   is [1, 1]_16,
%e A331807    a(48) = 2593 is [1, 6, 1]_48.
