%N A331880 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers such that (last digit of a(n)) > (first digit of a(n+1)).
%C A331880 No integer ending in 0 or 1 is a member of the sequence.

%e A331880 a(1) cannot be 1 as there is no a(2) whose first digit would be 0
%e A331880 a(1) = 2 and 2 (the last digit) is > 1, this 1 being the first digit of a(2) = 12
%e A331880 a(2) = 12 and 2 (the last digit) is > 1, this 1 being the first digit of a(3) = 13
%e A331880 a(3) = 13 and 3 (the last digit) is > 1, this 1 being the first digit of a(4) = 14
%e A331880 a(4) = 14 and 4 (the last digit) is > 3, this 3 being the first digit of a(5) = 3; etc.
%Y A331880 Cf. A331879 for the variant where the last digit of a(n) is < than the first digit of a(n+1).
