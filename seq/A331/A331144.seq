%N A331144 Irregular triangle read by rows: row n gives coefficients (in increasing order of powers of x) of normalized numerator polynomial of generating function for hexagonal net (honeycomb) directed site animals. Here n is the number of sites supported in one particular way.
%C A331144 Guttmann-Conway give coefficients for rows n <= 9.
%C A331144 This triangle just gives the numerators of the generating functions. Although it is not clear from their descriptions, it appears that A055907-A055915 give the expansions of the actual generating functions.
