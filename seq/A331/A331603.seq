%N A331603 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, if a(n-1) is composite then a(n) is the concatenation of all the prime factors in order of a(n-1), otherwise a(n) is the smallest number not yet appearing in the sequence.
%C A331603 Assuming that all numbers when replaced with the concatenation of their prime factors will eventually reach a prime (see A037274), this sequence will contain all positive integers. a(158) = 49 which currently has no known 'home prime' in the iterative sequence of prime factor replacements; see A056938.

%e A331603 a(5) = 22 as a(4) = 4 which has a factorization 4 = 2*2, so the concatenation of factors is '22'.
%e A331603 a(7) = 5 as a(6) = 211 which is prime, and 5 is the smallest number not yet appearing in the sequence.
%e A331603 a(14) = 31941 as a(13) = 2337 which has a factorization 2337 = 3*19*41, so the concatenation of factors is '31941'.
