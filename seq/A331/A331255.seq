%N A331255 Triangles with integer sides i <= j <= k sorted by radius of circumcircle, and, in case of ties, lexicographically by side lengths (smallest first). The sequence gives the middle side j. The other sides are in A331254 and A331256.
%e A331255 See A331254.
%Y A331255 Cf. A331227, A331228 (squared radius of circumcircle), A331254 (shortest side), A331256 (longest side).
