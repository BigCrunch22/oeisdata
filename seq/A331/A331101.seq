%N A331101 Denominators of the best approximations for sqrt(2).
%C A331101 For numerators, see A331115.
%C A331101 Let w = sqrt(2). Each of the principal convergents 1/1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, ..., see A002965, represents a best approximation for w because no other fraction with a smaller denominator is closer to w.
%C A331101 However, with abs(3/2 - w) > abs(4/3 - w)> abs(7/5 - w), 4/3 is another best approximation which has to be inserted. Generally, after each principal convergent p/q, we must insert the correspondent intermediate convergent 2q/p = (2/1), 4/3, (10/7), 24/17, ..., if it is closer to w than p/q (terms without brackets).
%C A331101 It is a well-known fact that the geometric mean sqrt(a*b) of two factors a and b is closer to the smaller one. As w is the geometric mean of p/q and 2q/p, the second term is inserted if it is smaller than p/q. This applies to every second intermediate convergent because the principal convergents alternately undershoot and overshoot w.

%F A331101 If n mod 3 = 2: a(n) = 3*a(n - 1) - a(n - 2), otherwise: a(n) = a(n - 1) + a(n - 2), with a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2.

%e A331101 The fractions are 1/1, 3/2, 4/3, 7/5, 17/12, 24/17, ...
%e A331101 Let w = sqrt(2) again. The first four principal convergents are, see comments, 1/1 (which is less than w), 3/2 (greater than w), 7/5 (less than w), 17/12 (greater than w). After 3/2, the fraction 2 * 2/3 = 4/3 is inserted because 4/3 < 3/2 and therefore w - 4/3 < 3/2 - w (0.081... < 0.085...). After 7/5, the fraction 2 * 5/7 = 10/7 is not inserted, because 10/7 > 7/5 etc.
