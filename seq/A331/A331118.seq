%N A331118 Irregular triangle read by rows where row n lists primitive first differences in the reduced residue system of A002110(n).
%C A331118 Let primorial P(n) = A002110(n) and let r < P(n) be a number such that gcd(r, P(n)) = 1. Thus r is a residue in the reduced residue system (RRS) of P(n), and the number of r pertaining to P(n) is given by phi(P(n)) = A005867(n). We take the union of the first differences of the r in the RRS of P(n) to arrive at row n of this sequence.
%C A331118 Let L be the run length of numbers m in the cototient of a number k and let the first differences D in the RRS of k. The cototient includes any m such that at least 1 prime p | m also divides k, in other words, any m such that gcd(m, k) > 1. We note L = D - 1.
%C A331118 Row n of this sequence is the union of first differences of row n of A286941.
%C A331118 Let D be a primitive first difference as defined above. D is necessarily even since P(n) (for n > 0) is even and all r are odd.
%C A331118 Length of row n = A329815(n).

%e A331118 (Triangle is organized so that the D appear in columns.)
%e A331118 Row 1 = {2} because P(1) = 2 is prime and has only 2 itself in the cototient.
%e A331118 Row 2 = {2, 4} since the numbers {1, 5} are coprime to P(2) = 6, and their difference is 4.
%e A331118 Row 3 contains {2, 4, 6} since we encounter the run lengths 6 between 1 and 7, 4 between 7 and 11, and 2 between 11 and 13. The run lengths are repeated but no new lengths appear for P(3) = 30.
