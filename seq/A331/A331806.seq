%N A331806 a(n) is the least prime p > n which is palindromic in base n.
%C A331806 Using a representation where the digits of the prime are written between "[" and "]_" separated by commas with the base following the "_" then by checking up to a base of 7000 (where the lowest prime palindrome is [1, 1]_7000):
%C A331806 1) Either the palindrome is [1, 1]_n where n is one less than a prime number, or [1, X, 1]_n where X << n, asymptotically.
%C A331806 2) Many prime numbers occur more than once, e.g.,
%C A331806     13 is [1, 1, 1]_3  and [1, 1]_12;
%C A331806     71 is [1, 3, 1]_7  and [1, 1]_70;
%C A331806   1471 is [1, 7, 1]_35 and [1, 1]_1470.
