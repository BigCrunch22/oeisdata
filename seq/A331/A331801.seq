%N A331801 Integers that are sum of two nonsquarefree numbers.
%C A331801 Proposition: All integers > 23 are terms of this sequence (see link Prime Curios!).
%C A331801 Proof by exhaustion:
%C A331801 1) For numbers {4*k} with k>=6, then 4*k = 4*(k-1) + 4 is a term as 4*(k-1) and 4 are nonsquarefree;
%C A331801 2) For numbers {4*k+1} with k>=6, then 4*k+1 = 4*(k-2) + 9 is a term as 4*(k-2) and 9 are nonsquarefree;
%C A331801 3) For numbers {4*k+2} with k>=6, then 4*k+2 = 4*(k-4) + 18 is a term as 4*(k-4) and 18 are nonsquarefree;
%C A331801 4) For numbers {4*k+3}; with k=6, 27 = 9+18 is a term as 9 and 18 are nonsquarefree, and with k>=7, 4*k+3 = 4*(k-6) + 27 is also a term as 4*(k-6) and 27 are nonsquarefree.
%C A331801 Conclusion: every integer > 23 is sum of two nonsquarefree numbers (QED).

%e A331801 13 = 4 + 9 and 21 = 9 + 12 are terms of this sequence as 4, 9 and 12 are nonsquarefree numbers.
