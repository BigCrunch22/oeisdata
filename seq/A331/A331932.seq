%N A331932 Triangle read by rows: Take a hexagon with all diagonals drawn, as in A331931. Then T(n,k) = number of k-sided polygons in that figure for k = 3, 4, ..., n+4.
%C A331932 See the links in A331931 for images of the hexagons.

%e A331932 A hexagon with no other points along its edges, n = 1, contains 18 triangles, 6 quadrilaterals and no other n-gons, so the first row is [18,6,0]. A hexagon with 1 point dividing its edges, n = 2, contains 264 triangles, 108 quadrilaterals, 36 pentagons and no other n-gons, so the second row is [264,108,36,0].
