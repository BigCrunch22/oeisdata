%N A331854 a(n) is the number of distinct values obtained by partitioning the binary representation of n into consecutive blocks, and then applying the bitwise OR operator to the numbers represented by the blocks.

%e A331854 For n = 6:
%e A331854 - the binary representation of 6 is "110",
%e A331854 - we can split it in 4 ways:
%e A331854       "110" -> 6
%e A331854       "1" and "10" -> 1 OR 2 = 3
%e A331854       "11" and "0" -> 3 OR 0 = 3
%e A331854       "1" and "1" and "0" -> 1 OR 1 OR 0 = 1
%e A331854 - we have 3 distinct values,
%e A331854 - hence a(6) = 3.
