%N A331782 Total number of vertices in graph formed by the straight line segments connecting the edges of an equilateral triangle with the n-1 points resulting from a subdivision of the sides into n equal pieces, counting coinciding intersection points only once.
%C A331782 a(n) <= 3*(n^2-n+1), with equality iff n is odd and not a member of A332378. A331423 gives the difference between a(n) and the upper bound.
%H A331782 N. J. A. Sloane, <a href="/A331782/b331782.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..1000</a>
%F A331782 a(n) = A091908(n) + 3*n.
%Y A331782 Cf. A091908, A092098 (number of cells), A332376 (number of edges), A332378, A331423.
