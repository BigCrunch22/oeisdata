%N A331621 Number of distinct structures that can be made from n cubes without overhangs.
%C A331621 This is an extension of the free polyominoes (A000105) to the third dimension. Structures are considered equivalent if they can be mapped into each other by reflection in a vertical plane or rotation around the vertical axis. They are not equivalent if they can only be mapped onto each other by rotation around an axis parallel to the horizontal plane.

%e A331621 For n = 0, one (the empty) structure is possible.
%e A331621 For n = 1, only one structure is possible, a single cube.
%e A331621 For n = 2, two structures are possible: two cubes one on top of the other, and two next to each other.
%e A331621 For n = 3, four structures are possible: an L shape with the L oriented vertically, an L shape with the L laid flat, a structure with 3 cubes stacked on top of each other and a structure with 3 cubes laid flat.
%e A331621 For n = 4, there are 12 possible distinct structures made from 4 cubes without overhangs. These include 1 structure that is 4 cubes tall, 1 structure that is 3 cubes tall, 5 structures that are 2 cubes tall and 5 that are 1 cube tall.
