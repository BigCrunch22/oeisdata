%N A242928 Least number k such that (k^k+n^n)/(k+n) is prime or 0 if no such k exists.
%C A242928 If a(i) = j, then a(j) <= i for all i and j.
%C A242928 a(n) = 0 is confirmed for k <= 2500. These are just conjectural.
%e A242928 (1^1+1^1)/(1+1) = 1 is not prime. (2^2+1^1)/(2+1) = 5/3 is not prime. (3^3+1^1)/(3+1) = 7 is prime. Thus, a(3) = 1 and a(1) = 3.

%E A242928 We don't normally allow conjectural terms, except in special circumstances. This is one of those exceptions, for if we included only terms that are known for certain, not much of this sequence would remain. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 31 2014
