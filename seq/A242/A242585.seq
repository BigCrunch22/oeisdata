%N A242585 Number of divisors of the n-th positive number that is both triangular and square.
%C A242585 Number of divisors of A001110(n).
%C A242585 Since each term in A001110 is a square, each term in this sequence is an odd number.
%C A242585 Adding terms to this sequence requires obtaining the prime factorization of terms from A001110. This is facilitated by the observation that A001110(n) = (A000129(n)*A001333(n))^2, but after a few hundred terms, it becomes difficult to obtain the prime factorization of some of the values of A000129(n) and A001333(n).
%C A242585 Obviously, a(1) is the only term whose value is 1. It can be shown (see A081978) that 15 appears only at a(7).
%C A242585 Conjectures:
%C A242585 (1) There exist only 5 triangular numbers with exactly 9 divisors: the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 29th, and 59th terms of A001110.
%C A242585 (2) A001110(4)=41616 is the only triangular number with exactly 45 divisors.
%C A242585 (3) A001110(6)=48024900 is the only triangular number with exactly 405 divisors.
%C A242585 (4) A001110(8)=55420693056 is the only triangular number with exactly 189 divisors.

%e A242585 a(2) = 9 because A001110(2) = 36 = 2^2 * 3^2 has (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 divisors.
%e A242585 a(4) = 45 because A001110(4) = 41616 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 17^2 has (4+1)*(2+1)*(2+1) divisors.
%e A242585 a(6) = 405 because A001110(6) = 48024900 = 2^2 * 3^4 * 5^2 * 7^2 * 11^2 has (2+1)*(4+1)*(2+1)*(2+1)*(2+1) = 405 divisors.
