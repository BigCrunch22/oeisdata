%N A242298 Once a number in this sequence is divisible by all numbers 1 to m, subsequent terms are constrained to have the same property; choose the smallest permissible number that is greater than the previous term.
%C A242298 All terms from A095848 belong to this sequence.

%F A242298 a(1) = 1. If n > 1, a(n) = a(n-1) + A368777(a(n-1)). - _Hal M. Switkay_, Jan 26 2024
%e A242298 After 6, none of 7,8,9,10 or 11 are in the sequence since they are not divisible by 1,2 and 3 as 6 is. 12 is a term, but is now divisible by 1,2,3 and 4, adding a new constraint on subsequent terms.
%e A242298 After 24, 30 is not in the sequence because 24 is divisible by all numbers from 1 to 4 and 30 is not divisible by 4. But 36, which is divisible by all of 1 through 4, is a term.
%e A242298 As an irregular table, the n-th row consists of all numbers divisible by A051451(n) but not by A051451(n+1). - _Tom Edgar_, May 22 2014
