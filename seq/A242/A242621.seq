%N A242621 Start of the least triple of consecutive squarefree numbers each of which has exactly n distinct prime factors.
%C A242621 As the example of a(4)=27962 shows, "consecutive squarefree numbers" means consecutive elements of A005117, not necessarily consecutive integers that (additionally) are squarefree; this would be a more restrictive condition.
%C A242621 a(8) <= 102099792179229 because A093550 - 1 is an upper bound of the present sequence.

%e A242621 The two squarefree numbers following a(4)=27962, namely, 27965 and 27966, also have 4 prime divisors just as a(4).
%Y A242621 See A242605-A242608 for triples of consecutive squarefree numbers with m=2,..,5 prime factors.
%Y A242621 See A246470 for the quadruplet and A246548 for the 5-tuple versions of this sequence.
%Y A242621 See A039833, A066509, A176167 and A192203 for triples of consecutive numbers which are squarefree and have m=2,..,5 prime factors.
