%N A242284 Greedy residue sequence of triangular numbers 3, 6, 10, 15, ...
%C A242284 Suppose that s = (s(1), s(2), ... ) is a sequence of real numbers such that for every real number u, at most finitely many s(i) are < u, and suppose that x > min(s).  We shall apply the greedy algorithm to x, using terms of s.  Specifically, let i(1) be an index i such that s(i) = max{s(j) < x}, and put d(1) = x - s(i(1)).  If d(1) < s(i) for all i, put r = x - s(i(1)).  Otherwise, let i(2) be an index i such that s(i) = max{s(j) < x - s(i(1))}, and put d(2) = x - s(i(1)) - s(i(2)).  If d(2) < s(i) for all i, put r = x - s(i(1)) - s(i(2)).  Otherwise, let i(3) be an index i such that s(i) = max{s(j) < x - s(i(1)) - s(i(2))}, and put d(3) = x - s(i(1)) - s(i(2)) - s(i(3)).  Continue until reaching k such that d(k) < s(i) for every i, and put r = x - s(i(1)) - ... - s(i(k)).  Call r the s-greedy residue of x, and call s(i(1)) + ... + s(i(k)) the s-greedy sum for x.   If r = 0, call x s-greedy summable.  If s(1) = min(s) < s(2), then taking x = s(i) successively for i = 2, 3,... gives a residue r(i) for each i; call (r(i)) the greedy residue sequence for s.  When s is understood from context, the prefix "s-" is omitted.  For A242284, s = (1,3,6,10,15,...); s(n) = n(n + 1)/2.
