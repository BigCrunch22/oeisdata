%N A242457 Least number k such that k!/n is prime, or 0 if no such number exists.

%e A242457 a(3) = 3 because 3!/3 = 6/3 = 2, which is prime.
%e A242457 a(4) = 0 because there is no k such that k!/4 is a prime. For all k > 3, k! has 24 as a divisor, so therefore k!/4 has 6 as a divisor and is therefore certainly composite.
