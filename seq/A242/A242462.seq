%C A242462 Note: this sequence will terminate if a power of 2 occurs.
%C A242462 Conjecture: this sequence is infinite (so it contains no powers of 2). The similarly defined sequence starting with a(1) = 6 terminates after 2 terms: 6 and 16.
%C A242462 Conjecture is true if it turns out that one number in this sequence is one more than a multiple of 41. Any number of the form 2^n-1 that is divisible by 41 is also divisible by 25, which is the square of a prime number greater than 3. Because numbers one less than this sequence's terms are always 9 times a squarefree number, this proves that if a number one less than this sequence is divisible by 41, then this sequence is infinite. - _J. Lowell_, Jul 17 2017
%C A242462 Conjecture is also true if it turns out that one number in this sequence is a multiple of either 19 or 73. Any number of the form 2^n-1 that is divisible by 19 is divisible by 27, and any number of the form 2^n-1 that is divisible by both 73 and 9 is divisible by 27. Numbers one less than this sequence are always divisible by 9 but not by 27. - _J. Lowell_, Feb 27 2022
%e A242462 a(1) = 10; 10-1 = 9; 9*5 (smallest odd prime factor of 10) is 45; 45+1=46, so a(2) = 46.
