%N A242933 Numbers n such that k*n/(k+n) is never prime for all k.
%C A242933 If n were an odd number, k*n/(k+n) would never be prime for all k; these are trivial and are not included. See A242932.
%C A242933 It is believed that numbers in A016742 (except 4) are members of this sequence.
%e A242933 16*k/(16+k) is an integer for k = 16, 48, 112, and 240. These k-values give the integers 8, 12, 14, and 15, respectively. Since none are prime, 16 is a member of this sequence.
