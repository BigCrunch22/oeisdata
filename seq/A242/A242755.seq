%N A242755 Primes p such that pi(p)*q == 1 (mod p) for some prime q < p, where pi(p) is the number of primes not exceeding p.
%C A242755 According to the conjecture in A242753, this sequence should contain infinitely many primes.
%C A242755 Conjecture: The number of such primes not exceeding x > 1 has the main term x/(log x)^2 as x tends to infinity.

%e A242755 a(4) = 13 since 13 is prime with pi(13) = 6, and 6*11 == 1 (mod 13) with 11 prime, but pi(11)*9 == 1 (mod 11) with 9 not prime.
