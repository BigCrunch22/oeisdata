%N A242082 Nim sequence of game on n counters whose legal moves are removing some number of counters in A027941.
%C A242082 Aperiodic, ternary sequence.
%C A242082 Result of applying the map 0->01, 1->2 to A188432.
%C A242082 Let w(1)=01. For all i>1, let w(i)=w(i-1)w(i-1)w(i-2)...w(2)w(1)2 (as a concatenation of words). The limit of this process is this sequence.
%C A242082 Also the Nim sequence of game on n counters whose legal moves are removing either 1 counter or some number of counters in A089910.
%C A242082 a(n+2) = A159917(n), the infinite Fibonacci sequence on {0,1,2}. See also the standard form A270788 of A159917, explaining the formula below. - _Michel Dekking_, Dec 27 2016

%F A242082 a(n)=0 if and only if n=0 or n is in A001950.
%F A242082 a(n)=1 if and only if a(n-1)=0, which happens if and only if n is in A026352.
%F A242082 a(n)=2 if and only if n is in A089910.
