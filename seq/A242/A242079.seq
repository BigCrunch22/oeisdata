%N A242079 a(1)=1. a(n)=smallest integer greater than 2*a(n-1) such that the Nim sequence of the first n terms is ternary, periodic and not equal to the Nim sequence of the first n-1 terms.
%C A242079 In the sequence definition, "Nim sequence of a set" means "Nim sequence of the subtraction game with that subtraction set."
%C A242079 This sequence is not known to be infinite.
%C A242079 If this sequence is infinite, then its Nim sequence is ternary and aperiodic.
