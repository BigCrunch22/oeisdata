%N A242561 a(0)=0; thereafter, a(n) is n multiplied by the distance of a(n-1) to the nearest prime.
%C A242561 It appears that any starting value a(0) will produce a sequence which merges with this one at some point.
%C A242561 Also, if we create a new sequence, call it b(n), from this one by changing one term, say a(k), then it appears that there exists an index m such that a(n)=b(n) for all n>=m. For example, if we replace a(10) by 1341, which is a number within the prime gap 1327-1361, then this new sequence has b(17)=a(17) and so the two sequences agree after that point. - _J. M.

%F A242561 a(n+1) = n*A051699(a(n)), starting a(0)=0.
%e A242561 The sequence begins with a(0)=0, so |2-0|=2 and a(1)=1*2=2; find
%e A242561 the next m=|2-2|=0, so a(2)=0*2=0; find the next m=|2-0|=2, so a(3)=3*2=6; find the next m=|7-6|=1, so a(4)=1*4=4.
