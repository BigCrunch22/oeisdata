%N A242435 Number of terms of A182116 between 2^n and 2^(n+1).
%C A242435 This was done with data on Carmichael numbers below 10^21 provided by R. G. E. Pinch, and special computational assistance from William Stein.
%C A242435 There are 16396564 Carmichael numbers below 2^69 but only 849752 have the property of A182116. It looks as though the ratio of Carmichael numbers of this type to normal Carmichael numbers converges to a value around 0.051.
