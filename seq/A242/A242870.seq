%N A242870 Numbers n such that (n^n-2^2)/(n-2) is an integer.
%C A242870 a(n) is even for all n > 2. 1 and 3 are members of this sequence because (n^n-2^2)/(n-2) becomes (2^2-n^n) and (n^n-2^2), respectively, which are both integers.
%C A242870 Given the term (n^n-k^k)/(n-k) (here, k=2), whenever k = 2^m for some m, there are significantly fewer data values within a given range of numbers. See A242871 for k=3.
%C A242870 These are also numbers n such that (2^n-n^2)/(n-2) is an integer.
