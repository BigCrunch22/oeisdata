%N A242165 Smallest k>=0, such that n+/-k are both Fermi-Dirac primes (A050376).
%C A242165 The existence of a(n)>=0 for all n >= 2 is equivalent to the Goldbach conjecture in Fermi-Dirac arithmetic (cf. comment in A241927) that every even number >= 4 is a sum of two terms of A050376 (it is slightly weaker than Goldbach conjecture for primes).
