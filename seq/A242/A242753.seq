%N A242753 Number of ordered ways to write n = k + m with 0 < k <= m such that the inverse of k mod prime(k) among 1, ..., prime(k) - 1 is prime and the inverse of m mod prime(m) among 1, ..., prime(m) - 1 is also prime.
%C A242753 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 3.
%C A242753 This implies that there are infinitely many positive integers k such that k*q == 1 (mod prime(k)) for some prime q < prime(k).

%e A242753 a(11) = 1 since 11 = 4 + 7, 4*2 == 1 (mod prime(4)=7) with 2 prime, and 7*5 == 1 (mod Prime(7)=17) with 5 prime.
%e A242753 a(36) = 1 since 36 = 18 + 18, and 18*17 == 1 (mod 61) with 17 prime.
%e A242753 a(46) = 1 since 46 = 6 + 40, 6*11 == 1 (mod prime(6)= 13) with 11 prime, and 40*13 == 1 (mod prime(40)=173) with 13 prime.
