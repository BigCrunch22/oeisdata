%N A242361 Irregular triangular array of denominators of the positive rational numbers ordered as in Comments.
%C A242361 Let F = A000045 (the Fibonacci numbers).  To construct the array of positive rationals, decree that row 1 is (1) and row 2 is (2).   Thereafter, row n consists of the following numbers in increasing order: the F(n-2) numbers 1/x from numbers x > 1 in row n-1, together with the F(n-3) numbers 1 + 1/x from numbers x < 1 in row n - 1, together with the F(n - 2) numbers (2*x + 1)/ (x + 1) from numbers x in row n-2.  Row n consists of F(n) numbers ranging from 1/((n+1)/2) to n/2 if n is odd and from 2/(n-1) to (n+2)/2 if n is even.
