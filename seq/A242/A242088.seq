%N A242088 Number of edges in the convex hull of a rigorous solution to Thomson's problem for n points.
%C A242088 Thomsonâ€™s problem is to determine the stable equilibrium configuration(s) of n particles confined to the surface of a sphere and repelling each other by an inverse square force.
%C A242088 Rigorous solutions are known only for n <= 6 and n = 12, with a(12) = 30.
%C A242088 Non-rigorous solutions are given in Wikipedia for all n <= 460. The least non-monotonic pair is 63 > 60 for n = 23 and 24, respectively.

%F A242088 a(n) <= n(n-1)/2 = (n choose 2).
%F A242088 a(n) <= 3*n-6 = A008585(n-2) for n >= 3, since a solution to Thomson's problem gives a planar graph, which has 3*n-6 edges if it is maximal (see A008486 comments). - _Jonathan Sondow_, Mar 03 2018 answering a question by Joseph Wheat.
%e A242088 For n = 0 or 1 points, the convex hull is empty or a point, so there are no edges and a(0) = a(1) = 0.
%Y A242088 Cf. A008486, A008585, A080865, A242617, A268487.
