%N A242922 Least number k such that (k^n+n^k)/(k+n) is prime or 0 if no such k exists.
%C A242922 If a(i) = j, then a(j) = i for any i and j.
%C A242922 a(n) = 0 is definite for n=1. For other n-values where a(n) = 0, it is confirmed for k <= 5000. These are only conjectural.
%e A242922 (8^3+3^8)/(8+3) = 7073/11 = 643 is prime. Thus, a(3) = 8 and a(8) = 3.

%E A242922 We don't normally allow conjectural terms, except in special circumstances. This is one of those exceptions, for if we included only terms that are known for certain, not much of this sequence would remain. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 31 2014
