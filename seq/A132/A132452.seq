%N A132452 First primitive GF(2)[X] polynomials of degree n with exactly 5 terms, X^n suppressed.
%C A132452 More precisely: minimum value for X=2 of GF(2)[X] polynomials P[X] of degree less than n and exactly 4 terms such that X^n+P[X] is primitive.
%C A132452 Applications include maximum-length linear feedback shift registers with efficient implementation in both hardware and software.
%C A132452 Proof is needed that there exists a primitive GF(2)[X] polynomial P[X] of degree n and exactly 5 terms for all n>4.

%e A132452 a(11)=23, or 10111 in binary, representing the GF(2)[X] polynomial X^4+X^2+X^1+1, because X^11+X^4+X^2+X^1+1 has exactly 5 terms and it is primitive, contrary to X^11+X^3+X^2+X^1+1.
%Y A132452 For n>4, 2^n+a(n) belongs to A091250. A132451(n) = a(n)+2^n and gives the corresponding primitive polynomial. Cf. A132448, similar, with no restriction on number of terms. Cf. A132450, similar, with restriction to at most 5 terms. Cf. A132454, similar, with restriction to minimal number of terms.
