%N A132854 Number of sequences {c(i), i=0..n} that form the initial terms of a self-convolution 4th power of an integer sequence such that 0 < c(n) <= 4*c(n-1) for n>0 with c(0)=1.
%C A132854 The minimal path in the 4-convoluted tree is A083954 and the maximal path is A132837.
%C A132854 Equals the number of nodes at generation n in the 4-convoluted tree, which is defined as follows: tree of all finite sequences {c(k), k=0..n} that form the initial terms of a self-convolution 4th power of some integer sequence such that 0 < c(n) <= 4*c(n-1) for n>0 with a(0)=1. - _Paul D.
