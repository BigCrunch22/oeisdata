%e A132828 1, 3, 8, 21, 55, 144, ... appear at the end of the sequence presumably since the infinite word after truncating the first 0, 2, 7, 20, 54, 143 terms has more 1's to the left side of the sequence. Consider the value where the terms to the right are 2 raised to increasingly negative powers.
