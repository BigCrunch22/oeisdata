%N A132450 First primitive GF(2)[X] polynomials of degree n with at most 5 terms, X^n suppressed.
%C A132450 More precisely: minimum value for X=2 of GF(2)[X] polynomials P[X] with at most 4 terms such that X^n+P[X] is primitive. Applications include maximum-length linear feedback shift registers with efficient implementation in both hardware and software. The limitation of the number of terms occurs first for a(32), which is 197 representing X^7+X^6+X^2+1, rather than 175 representing X^7+X^5+X^3+X^2+X^1+1. Proof is needed that there exists a primitive GF(2)[X] polynomial P[X] of degree n and at most 5 terms for all positive n.

%e A132450 a(11)=5, or 101 in binary, representing the GF(2)[X] polynomial X^2+1, because X^11+X^2+1 has no more than 5 terms and X is primitive, contrary to X^11, X^11+1, X^11+X^1, X^11+X^1+1 and X^11+X^2.
%Y A132450 2^n+a(n) belongs to A091250. A132449(n) = a(n)+2^n and gives the corresponding primitive polynomial. Cf. A132448 (similar, with no restriction on number of terms). Cf. A132452 (similar, with restriction to exactly 5 terms).
