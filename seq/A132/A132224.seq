%F A132224 This is the normalization of A132223, formed by concatenating segments obtained from segments of A132223, as follows: segment 1 is 1. Segment 2 is 12. Segment 3 is 123, formed from the segment 1423 in A132223 by retaining only numbers up to 3. Segment 4 is 1423, formed from segment 1423 in A132223 by retaining only numbers up to 4. In general, the n-th segment of A132224 (this sequence) is a permutation of (1,2,3,...,n) formed from the first segment of A132223 that contains n by deleting from it all numbers greater than n.
%e A132224 The first 7 successive segments are 1, 12, 123, 1423, 14235, 142635.
