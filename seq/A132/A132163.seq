%N A132163 Triangle read by rows. For row n, start with 1 but from the second term onwards always choose the largest positive integer between 1 and n inclusive that i) has not already appeared in the row ii) gives a prime when added to the previous term. Stop if no such integer can be found.
%C A132163 The following statements are conjectural: 1) The n-th row is always a permutation of 1,...,n. 2) For the even rows, the last term is one less than a prime (so the row gives a solution to the prime circle problem - see A051252). 3) There exists a (unique) sequence b(2), b(3),... with the property that for every n > 1 there is a positive integer N such that every even row of the triangle from the 2N-th onwards ends b(n), ..., b(3), b(2) and every odd row from the (2N - 1)-th onwards ends b(n)+(-1)^n, ..., b(3)-1, b(2)+1. (If the sequence b(n) exists it is probably A132075 without the initial term 1.)
