%N A132447 First primitive GF(2)[X] polynomial of degree n.
%C A132447 More precisely: Minimum value for X=2 of primitive GF(2)[X] polynomials of degree n. Applications include maximum-length linear feedback shift registers with efficient implementation in software.

%e A132447 a(5)=37, or 100101 in binary, representing the GF(2)[X] polynomial X^5+X^2+1, because it has degree 5 and is primitive, contrary to X^5, X^5+1, X^5+x^1, X^5+X^1+1 and X^5+X^2.
%Y A132447 a(n) is the smallest member of A091250 at least 2^n. A132448(n) = a(n)-2^n, giving a more compact representation. Cf. A132449, similar, with restriction to at most 5 terms. Cf. A132451, similar, with restriction to exactly 5 terms. Cf. A132453, similar, with restriction to minimal number of terms.
