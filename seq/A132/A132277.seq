%N A132277 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is number of paths in the first quadrant from (0,0) to (n,0) using steps U=(1,1), D=(1,-1), h=(1,0) and H=(2,0), having exactly k h-steps.
%C A132277 T(2n+1,0)=0; T(2n,0)=A006318(n) (the large Schroeder numbers). Row sums yield A128720. Sum(k*T(n,k),k=0..n)=A106053(n+1).
%F A132277 G.f.=G=G(t,z) satisfies G = 1 + tzG + z^2*G + z^2*G^2 (see explicit expression at the Maple program).
%e A132277 T(4,2)=9 because we have hhH, hhUD, hHh, hUDh, Hhh, UDhh, hUhD, UhDh and UhhD.
%p A132277 G:=((1-t*z-z^2-sqrt((1-2*z-t*z-z^2)*(1+2*z-t*z-z^2)))*1/2)/z^2: Gser:=simplify(series(G,z=0,15)): for n from 0 to 11 do P[n] := sort(coeff(Gser, z, n)) end do: for n from 0 to 11 do seq(coeff(P[n],t,j),j=0..n) end do; # yields sequence in triangular form
