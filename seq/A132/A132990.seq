%N A132990 Trajectory of 11 under map n -> A132988(n).
%C A132990 11 is the smallest number that does not belong to a cycle with elements <= 200000. Further numbers that do not belong to a cycle with elements <= 200000 and do not occur in the trajectory of a smaller number are 25, 59, 73, 75, 99, 125, ... .
%C A132990 Conjecture: Sequence is not periodic.
