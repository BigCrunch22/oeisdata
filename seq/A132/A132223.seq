%N A132223 A dense infinitive sequence.
%C A132223 The sequence is dense in the sense that any two neighboring terms in a segment are separated in all succeeding segments. Thus in the limiting para-sequence, each pair of positive integers are separated by infinitely many positive integers.
%C A132223 A sequence is an infinitive sequence if and only if it is a sequence that contains every positive integer and also contains itself as a proper subsequence.
%C A132223 See A132224 for the normalization of A132223, making A132224 a fractal sequence.
%C A132223 Imagine the following magic trick: A magician places a stack of 8 cards face-down on a table. Then he transfers the top card to the bottom of the stack and deals the new top card face-up on the table. He repeats the procedure until all the cards are dealt. And —- abracadabra! —- the cards are in decreasing order. To perform the trick, the magician needs to arrange the cards in advance according to step three described in this sequence: 1, 8, 4, 7, 2, 6, 3, 5. Step n allows the trick to be performed with 2^n cards. - _Tanya Khovanova_, Feb 19 2022

%e A132223 Start with 1,2. Separate them by 3,4, like this: 1,4,2,3. Then separate those by 5,6,7,8 like this: 1,8,4,7,2,6,3,5. Continue the process. Regard 1,2 and 1,4,2,3 and 1,8,4,7,2,6,3,5 as successive segments, so that the n-th segment has 2^n terms.
