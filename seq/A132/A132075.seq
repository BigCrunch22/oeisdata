%N A132075 A conjectured permutation of the positive integers such that for every n, a(n) is the largest number among a(1), a(2), ..., a(n) that when added to a(n+1) gives a prime.
%C A132075 The terms are defined as follows. Start by choosing the initial terms: 1, 2, 3. Then write the rows of table A088643 backwards but always leave off the last three quarters of the terms. This gives: [], [], [], [1], [1], [1], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 4, 3,], [1, 4, 3] etc. Then build the sequence up by repeatedly choosing the first such truncated row that extends the terms already chosen.

%C A132075 It is not until the 26th truncated row - [1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 6] - that the initial list is extended at all. It is unclear whether this process can be continued indefinitely, although I have verified by computer that it generates a sequence of at least 2000 terms. Conjecturally: (1) the sequence is infinite, (2) it is the unique sequence containing infinitely many complete rows of table A088643, and (3) for every n > 0 there exists N > 0 such that the first n terms of this sequence are contained in every row of table A088643 from the N-th onwards.
%C A132075 Maybe the idea could be expressed more concisely by defining this sequence as the limit of the reversed rows of A088643? - _M. F. Hasler_, Aug 04 2021
%C A132075 It seems we do not know of an existence proof for the limit of the reversed rows of A088643. - _Peter Munn_, Aug 19 2021
