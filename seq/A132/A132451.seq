%N A132451 First primitive GF(2)[X] polynomials of degree n with exactly 5 terms.
%C A132451 More precisely: minimum value for X=2 of primitive GF(2)[X] polynomials of degree n with exactly 5 terms, or 0 if no such polynomial exists. Applications include maximum-length linear feedback shift registers with efficient implementation in both hardware and software. Proof is needed that there exists a primitive GF(2)[X] polynomial P[X] of degree n and exactly 5 terms for all n>4.

%e A132451 a(6)=91, or 1011011 in binary, representing the GF(2)[X] polynomial X^6+X^4+X^3+X^1+1, because it has degree 6 and exactly 5 terms and is primitive, contrary to X^6+X^3+X^2+X^1+1 and X^6+X^4+X^2+X^1+1.
%Y A132451 For n>4, a(n) belongs to A091250. A132452(n) = a(n)-2^n, giving a more compact representation. Cf. A132447, similar, with no restriction on number of terms. Cf. A132449, similar, with restriction to a most 5 terms. Cf. A132453, similar, with restriction to minimal number of terms.
