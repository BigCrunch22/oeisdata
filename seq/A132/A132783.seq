%N A132783 Numbers n with the property that the difference between the two largest proper divisors of n equals the sum of proper divisors of the digit sum of n.
%C A132783 All but two members of the sequence below 20000000 are the products of two primes separated by 6 or 16 and have digit sums of 25 or 26, which have proper divisor sums of 6 (=1+5) and 16(=1+2+13) respectively. The exceptions are the 1st term (57), which has a digit sum of 12 and the 67th (18999857), which has a digit sum of 56.
%e A132783 The divisors of 57 are 1, 3 and 19, so the difference of the two largest is 16.
%e A132783 The divisors of its digit sum (12=5+7) are 1,2,3,4 and 6, which also sum to 16.
