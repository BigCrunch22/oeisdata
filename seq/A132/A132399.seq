%N A132399 Number of ordered ways of writing n = i + j, where i is 0 or a prime and j is a triangular number (A000217) >= 0.
%C A132399 Based on a posting by _Zhi-Wei Sun_ to the Number Theory Mailing List, Mar 23 2008, where he conjectures that a(n) > 0 except for n = 216.
%C A132399 _Zhi-Wei Sun_ has offered a monetary reward for settling this conjecture.
%C A132399 No counterexample below 10^10. - _D. S. McNeil_
%C A132399 Note that A076768 contains 216 and the numbers n whose only representation has 0 instead of a prime; all other integers appear to be the sum of a prime and a triangular number. Except for n=216, there is no other n < 2*10^9 for which a(n)=0.
%C A132399 It is clear that a(t) > 0 for any triangular number t because we always have the representation t = t+0. Triangular numbers tend to have only a few representations. Hence by not plotting a(n) for triangular n, the plot (see link) more clearly shows how a(n) slowly increases as n increases. This is more evidence that 216 is the only exception.
%C A132399 216 is the only exception less than 10^12. Let p(n) be the least prime (or 0 if n is triangular) such that n = p(n) + t(n), where t(n) is a triangular number. For n < 10^12, the largest value of p(n) is only 2297990273, which occurs at n=882560134401. - _T. D. Noe_, Jan 23 2009

%e A132399 0 = 0+0, so a(0) = 1,
