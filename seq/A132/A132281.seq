%N A132281 Noncomposites in A067200. Noncomposites (0, 1) and primes p such that A084380(p) = p^3 + 2 is prime.
%C A132281 The corresponding near-cube primes are A132282. Analog of near-square primes. After a(1) = 0, all values must be odd. Numbers of the form n^2+2 for n=1, 2, ... are 3, 6, 11, 18, 27, 38, 51, 66, 83, 102, ... (A059100). These are prime for indices n = 1, 3, 9, 15, 21, 33, 39, 45, 57, 81, 99, ... (A067201), corresponding to the near-square primes 3, 11, 83, 227, 443, 1091, 1523, 2027, ... (A056899). Helfgott proves with minor conditions that: "Let f be a cubic polynomial. Then there are infinitely many primes p such that f(p) is squarefree." Note that 47^3 + 2 = 103825 = 5^2 * 4153 and similarly 97^3 + 2 is divisible by 5^2, but otherwise an infinite number of p^3+2 are squarefree.
