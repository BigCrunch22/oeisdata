%N A132725 A 12 pentagons in dodecagon ( 12 sided polygon) substitution sequence where the substitution is to a pentagon symmetrical around to base note: a start sequence of:Reference A->1,4->C; {4, 4, 4, 4, 9, 9, 4, 4, 11, 11, 4, 4}-> {C,C,C,C,F,F,G,G,G,G,C,C} A classical jazz 12 bar sequence.
%C A132725 American jazz will be the classical music of the future. This 12 tones divided in to pentatonics is an effort to bridge the gap to a more complex music theory for jazz. It is also a continuation of my geometric 12 tone figures: in this case 5 connections per vertex is like a 5 dimensional graph as : 3 connections->3d 4 connections->4d 5 connections->5d
