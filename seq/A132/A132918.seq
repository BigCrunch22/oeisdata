%N A132918 Identity matrix with interpolated zeros.
%C A132918 Identity matrix with interpolated zeros, such that the diagonal of an infinite lower triangular matrix = (1, 0, 1, 0, 1, ...) with the rest zeros.
%C A132918 Given A132918 = matrix M, then M * any sequence as a vector replaces alternate terms with zeros; e.g., M * [1,2,3,...] = [1,0,3,0,5,...]. M * (any infinite lower triangular matrix) replaces alternate rows with zeros; e.g., M * A007318 = (1; 0,0; 1,2,1; 0,0,0,0; ...).
%C A132918 a(n) = 1 if n is a positive hexagonal number, A000384: (1, 6, 15, 28, 45, 66, ...); zero otherwise.
