%F A132226 For n>1, in the n-th segment of A132224 the only number not also in the (n-1)st segment is n. a(n) is the position of n in the n-th segment of A132224. The terms after the first two are formed by segments of consecutive integers: 3,2, then 5,4,3,2, then 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2, etc.
%e A132226 The first 7 successive segments of A132224 are 1, 12, 123, 1423, 14235, 142635, 1472635, from which we read the positions of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 as 1,2,3,2,5,4,3.
