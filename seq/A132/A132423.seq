%N A132423 a(m) is the smallest positive integer such that A132422(m,n) = A132422(m,n+a(m)) for all n > some value.
%C A132423 Does every sequence A132422(m,n), for fixed m, repeat after some point? If there is a prime > m in A132422(m,n) (for fixed m), then this sequence repeats.
%C A132423 Every sequence repeats because its terms are bounded. - _Charlie Neder_, Jan 15 2019
