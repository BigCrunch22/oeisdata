%N A132724 Number of occurrences through n^2 of the longest gap between numbers relatively prime to n (A132468).
%e A132724 For n=3, the longest gap in 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 is 1, between 2 and 4 and again between 5 and 7, so a(3) = 2.
%e A132724 For n=4, the longest gap in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 is 1, at (1,3), (3,5), (5,7), (7,9), (9,11), (11,13) and (13,15), so a(4) = 7.
%e A132724 The numbers coprime to 6 and smaller than 36 are {1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, 29, 31, 35}, the largest distance between two consecutive terms is 4; 4 appears as a distance in the cases (1,5),(7,11),(13,17),(19,23),(25,29) and (31,35) - it appears 6 times. Therefore a(6)=6.
