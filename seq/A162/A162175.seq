%N A162175 Primes classified by weight.
%C A162175 Conjecture: primes classified by level are rarefying among prime numbers.
%C A162175 A000040(n) = 2, 3, 7, A162174(n), a(n). - _Rémi Eismann_, Jun 27 2009
%C A162175 By definition, primes classified by weight have a prime gap g(n) < sqrt(p(n)) (or more precisely, for primes classified by weight, we have A001223(n) <= sqrt(A118534(n)) - 1 ). So by definition, prime numbers classified by weight follow Legendre's conjecture and Andrica's conjecture - _Rémi Eismann_, Aug 26 2013

%F A162175 If for prime(n), A117078(n) (the weight) <= A117563(n) (the level) and A117078(n) <> 0 then prime(n) is classified by weight. If for prime(n), A117078(n) (the weight) > A117563(n) (the level) then prime(n) is classified by level.
%e A162175 For prime(5)=11, A117078(5)=3 <= A117563(5)=3 ; prime(5)=11 is classified by weight. For prime(170)=1013, A117078(170)=19 <= A117563(170)=53 ; prime(170)=1013 is classified by weight.
