%N A162535 A positive integer k is included if every length of the runs of 0's and 1's in the binary representation of k is coprime to k.
%C A162535 By "run" of 0's or 1's, it is meant: Think of binary k as a string of 0's and 1's. A single run of the digit b (0 or 1) is made up completely of consecutive digits all equal to b, and is bounded on its ends by either the digit 1-b or the end of the string.

%e A162535 103 in binary is 1100111. There is a run of two 1's in this representation, and a run of two 0's and a run of three 1's. Since 103 is coprime to each of these lengths (2 and 3), 103 is in the sequence.
