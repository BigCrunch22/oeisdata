%N A162306 Irregular triangle in which row n contains the numbers <= n whose prime factors are a subset of prime factors of n.
%C A162306 Row n begins with 1, ends with n, and has A010846(n) terms.
%C A162306 From _Michael De Vlieger_, Jul 08 2014: (Start)
%C A162306 Prime p has {1, p} and A010846(p) = 2.
%C A162306 Prime power p^e has {1, p, ..., p^e} and A010846(p^e) = A000005(p^e) = e + 1.
%C A162306 Composite c that are not prime powers have A010846(c) = A000005(c) + A243822(c), where A243822(c) is nonzero positive, since the minimum prime divisor p of c produces at least one semidivisor (e.g., p^2 < c). Thus these have the set of divisors of c and at least one semidivisor p^2. For squareful c that are not prime powers, p^2 may divide c, but p^3 does not. The minimum squareful c = 12, 2^3 does not divide 12 yet is less than 12 and is a product of the minimum prime divisor of 12. All other even squareful c admit a power of 2 that does not divide c, since there must be another prime divisor q > 2. (end)
