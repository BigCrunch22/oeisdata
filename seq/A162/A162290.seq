%N A162290 Let A087788(n) = p*q*r, where p<q<r, be the n-th 3-Carmichael number. Then a(n) = (p-1)*(p*q*r-1)/((q-1)*(r-1)).
%C A162290 A.K. Devaraj conjectured that a(n) is always an integer, and this was proved by Carl Pomerance.
%C A162290 a(n) may be called the Pomerance index of the n-th 3-Carmichael number.
%C A162290 An application of Pomerance index: The index for the Carmichael number 561 is 7. This can be used to prove that 561 is the only 3-factor Carmichael number with 3 as one of its factors. Proof: Let N be a 3-factor composite number. Keep 3 fixed and increase the other two prime factors indefinitely. The relevant Pomerance index is a number less than 7 but greater than 6. As the other two prime factors are increased indefinitely the Pomerance index becomes asymptotic to 6. Hence 561 is the only 3-factor Carmichael number with 3 as a factor. - _A.K. Devaraj_, Jul 27 2010
%C A162290 Let p be a prime number. Then, along the lines indicated above, it can be proved that there are only a finite number of 3-Carmichael numbers divisible by p. - _A.K. Devaraj_, Aug 06 2010
