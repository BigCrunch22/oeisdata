%N A162157 Number of square numbers from 1 to n^2 where all decimal digits are at most the corresponding digit of n^2.
%C A162157 Proof that 1, 2, 3, and 7 are the only values for which a(n)=n. For any n >= 3, n^2 must end in 9 for a(n) to equal n, and so n must end in 3 or 7. a(13) is only 12 because of 81 having a next-to-last digit greater than 6 (from 169). a(17) is only 17 because of 196 having a next-to-last digit greater than 8 (from 289.) Similarly, for any n > 14 to have a(n) equal n, n^2 has to end in 99, for which no square number does. Therefore 1, 2, 3, and 7 are the only values for which a(n) = n.

%e A162157 a(8)=3 because only 1, 4, and 64 qualify. (The qualification for n=8 is that the final digit must be at most 4 and the next-to-last digit must be at most 6.)
