%N A162722 A positive integer k is included if when k is represented in binary, it contains the binary representations of every distinct prime dividing k as substrings, with overlapping of the substrings allowed (but not necessary).
%C A162722 Every integer of the form p*2^k, p = prime, k>=0, is in this sequence. Every integer of the form p*2^k, p = odd prime, is missing from sequence A162721.

%e A162722 20 in binary is 10100. The distinct primes dividing 20 are 2 and 5, which are 10 and 101 in binary. Both 10 and 101 occur in 10100 (with overlapping). So 20 is in this sequence.
