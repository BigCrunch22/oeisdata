%N A162324 Write the natural numbers as an infinite sequence of digits; starting at the left, cut into the smallest pieces so that each piece is a prime. Leading zeros are thrown away.
%C A162324 This is a "lossy" base-ten sequential-smallest-prime percolation of a Champernowne-substrate. The "lossless" version is A103575. The substrate percolates into identical terms 4-115 for both lossy and lossless versions. Terms 119-155 and 158-221 of the lossy version correspond to terms 117-153 and 155-218, respectively, of the lossless version. No other correspondences are known because of the subsequent interjection of very large primes. (For the purposes of this analysis, large probable primes have been treated as actual primes.)

%e A162324 After 1234567891 the next digit is 0 that has to be rejected. Next digits are 11 (prime); then 12, 13 (1213 prime); etc.
