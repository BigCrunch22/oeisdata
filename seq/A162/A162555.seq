%N A162555 a(n) = the smallest positive integer not occurring earlier in the sequence such that Sum_{k=1..n} a(k) written in decimal contains decimal n as a substring.

%e A162555 a(3) = 18 because that makes the sum of the first 3 terms 30, containing a substring of "3." 11 would make a sum of 23, but 11 was already used in a(2).
