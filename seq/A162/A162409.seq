%N A162409 Semiprimes of the form p*(k*p-1) where k > 1 (and p prime).
%C A162409 Regarding k = 1: 3 is the only prime p such that p-1 is prime, so 3*(1*3-1) = 6. But 6 is a term for p = 2 and k = 2 (see example), therefore the sequence does not change if k = 1 is allowed in the definition.
%e A162409 For p = 2 and k = 2 we have 2*(2*2-1) = 6, so 6 is a term. For p = 3 and k = 6 we have 3*(6*3-1) = 51, so 51 is a term.

%Y A162409 Subsequence of A006881 (product of two distinct primes).
