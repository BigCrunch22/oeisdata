%N A162180 Let a(n) = d[m(n),i] be the i-th divisor of the integer m(n) and the index j such that d[m(n),i] = d[m(n+1),j], m(n+1) is the first integer > m(n). The sequence a(n), starting with m(1) = 1, i = 1 is given by the conditions: a(1) = 1 and a(n+1) is the first predecessor of a(n) if n even, or the first successor of a(n) if n odd.
%C A162180 Conjecture: the sequence is the union of an infinity subsets of the form {1, 2}, {1, 5, 2, 3}, ..., {1, p, ..., q}, ... where the number 1 is the first element of each subset.
%C A162180 The corresponding values of m(n) are {1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 38, 40, 44, 46, 69, 72, 76, 78, 81, 82, 84, 85, 90, 93, 124, ...}.
%e A162180 a(1) = 1 ;
%e A162180 a(2) = 2 because the divisors of 2 are {1, 2} and 2 is the first successor of 1;
%e A162180 a(3) = 1 because the divisors of 3 are {1, 3} and 1 is the first predecessor of 2;
%e A162180 a(4) = 5 because the divisors of 5 are {1, 5} and 5 is the first successor of 1;
%e A162180 a(5) = 2 because the divisors of 10 are {1, 2, 5, 10} and 2 is the first predecessor of 5;
%e A162180 a(6) = 3 because the divisors of 12 are {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12} and 3 is the first successor of 2.
