%N A162887 Odd nonprimes in an alternating 1-based sum up to some odd nonprime.
%C A162887 Define the alternating sum S(u) = sum_{k=0..u} (1-(-1)^k*k) = A064455(u+1) as in A162886.
%C A162887 Evaluate the sum with upper limits u= 1,9, 15, 21... from A014076, and add S(u) to this sequence here whenever it is itself a member of A014076.
%e A162887 The sequence S(u) = 3, 15, 24, 33, 39, 42, 51, 54, 60, 69, ... is generated by u = 1, 9, 15, 21, ...
%e A162887 The first S-term, 3, is prime, and therefore not added to the sequence. The second S-term, 15, is an odd nonprime and added to the sequence. The third, 24, is even and not added to the sequence.
%Y A162887 Cf. A014076.
