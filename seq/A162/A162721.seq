%N A162721 A positive integer k is included if, when k is represented in binary, it contains the binary representation of every distinct prime dividing k as substrings, without overlapping of the substrings.
%C A162721 Includes all primes and powers of 2, but no even semiprimes except 4. Contains p^2 for primes p in A018826. - _Robert Israel_, Jan 10 2023
%C A162721 Contains no squarefree numbers except primes. - _Robert Israel_, Jan 12 2023

%e A162721 20 in binary is 10100. The distinct primes dividing 20 are 2 and 5, which are 10 and 101 in binary. Both 10 and 101 occur in 10100, but with overlapping. So 20 is not in this sequence. However, 54 in binary is 110110. 54 is divisible by 2 and 3, which are 10 and 11 in binary. Both 10 and 11 occur in 110110 without overlapping. (1{10}{11}0.) So 54 is in this sequence.
