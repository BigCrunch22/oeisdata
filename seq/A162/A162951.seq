%N A162951 a(1)=0. a(n) is the smallest integer > a(n-1) such that both a(n) and a(n)-a(n-1) have the same number of 1's when written in binary as n has when it is written in binary.
%C A162951 a(7)=41 is the final term because 8 has one binary 1, which means that a(8), if it existed, must be a power of 2, and a(8)-41 must be a power of 2. Since no two powers of 2 have a difference of 41, then the sequence has only 7 terms.
