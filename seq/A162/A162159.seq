%N A162159 The number of elements in S_4\det^{-1}(n)/GL(4,\Z), where we take det : M_{4 \x 4}(\Z) \rightarrow \Z.
%C A162159 Consider the set of 4 x 4 matrices with integer entries of a fixed determinant n. The group GL(4, \Z) acts on the right by multiplication. Similarly, the symmetric group S_4 acts on the left via multiplication by permutation matrices. The entry a_n is the number of elements in the double orbit space S_4\det^{-1}(n)/GL(4,\Z). The sequence a_n also gives the number of isomorphism classes of simplicial cones in \Z^4 of a certain index, or alternatively the number of affine toric varieties in dimension 4 arising from simplicial cones.
