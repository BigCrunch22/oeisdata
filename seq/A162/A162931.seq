%N A162931 Irregular table which maps each partition of n counted in A162932 to a binary number (converted to decimal).
%C A162931 The table encodes each partition of n which satisfies the requirements of A162932 into a binary number with run lengths of 1 determined by the frequency of the parts. As many most-significant-bits are set as determined by the run length of the largest part, each run of 1 is terminated by a 0, and missing parts in the partition are represented by consecutive zeros. Each part in the partition and its frequency pick one member of A079946, and the full binary number is a concatenation of these bits. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jul 13 2012
%e A162931 For n=17, the A162932(17)=4 solutions are 2+2+2+2+3+3+3, 2+3+3+3+3+3, 2+3+4+4+4, and 2+5+5+5. These are represented here by
%e A162931 111011110=478 (3 threes give a run length of 3, and four 2's give a run length of 4),
%e A162931 11111010=250 (five 3's give a run length of 5 and one 2 gives a run length of 1),
%e A162931 11101010=234 (three 4's give a run length of 3, one 3 gives a run length of 1 and one 2 gives another run length of 1),
%e A162931 and 11100010=226 (three 5's give a run length of 3, missing 4 and 3 give two run lengths of zero, one 2 give one run length of 1),
%e A162931 then sorted into row 17. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jul 13 2012
