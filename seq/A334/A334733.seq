%N A334733 a(n) is the sum of all parts of all partitions of n into consecutive parts that differ by 5.
%C A334733 The one-part partition n = n is included in the count.
%F A334733 a(n) = n*A334541(n).
%e A334733 For n = 27 there are three partitions of 27 into consecutive parts that differ by 5, including 27 as a valid partition. They are [27], [16, 11] and [14, 9, 4]. The sum of all parts is [27] + [16 + 11] + [14 + 9 + 4] = 81, so a(27) = 81.
%Y A334733 Sequences of the same family where the parts differs by k are: A038040 (k=0), A245579 (k=1), A060872 (k=2), A334463 (k=3), A327262 (k=4), this sequence (k=5).
