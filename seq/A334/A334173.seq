%N A334173 Least i such that i-th term of Thue-Morse sequence (A010060) differs from (i + n)-th term.
%C A334173 If the Thue-Morse sequence t(n) = A010060(n) = 1 then i=0 suffices since t(0)=0 != t(n).  If t(n)=0 then any 1-bits of i in the low 0-bits of n are the same in i and i+n so still t(i) = t(i+n).  The next smallest i is the lowest 1-bit of n (A006519).  If the lowest run of 1-bits in n is an odd length then adding this i does not change 1's parity (for example binary n = 0111 becomes i+n = 1000) so that t(i+n) = t(n) = 0 != t(i) = 1.  If the lowest run of 1-bits in n is an even length then the second lowest 1-bit of n is the next smallest i and similarly does not change 1's parity of i+n. - _Kevin Ryde_, Apr 27 2020

%F A334173 This system lets you compute a(n) very quickly.
%F A334173 a(n)=0 if A010060(n)=1, otherwise a(n) = A006519(n) or 2*A006519(n) according as A089309(n) odd or even respectively; where A006519 takes the lowest 1-bit of n, and A089309 is the length of the lowest run of 1-bits of n. - _Kevin Ryde_, Apr 27 2020
%e A334173 The first few terms of the Thue-Morse sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0... . Note that the Thue-Morse sequence has offset 0.
%e A334173 For n = 1, we see that the least i such that i and i + n index different terms is i = 0. Hence a(1) = 0.
%e A334173 For n = 2, the least i such that i and i + n index different terms is also i = 0. Hence a(2) = 0.
%e A334173 For n = 3, i = 0 won't work because Thue-Morse(0) and Thue-Morse(3) are both 0. Nor will i = 1 do because Thue-Morse(1) and Thue-Morse(4) are both 1. With i = 2, we see that Thue-Morse(2) = 1 and Thue-Morse(5) = 0. Hence a(3) = 0.
