%N A334813 Arithmetic numbers k (A003601) such that sigma(k)/d(k) is also an arithmetic number, where d(k) is the number of divisors of k (A000005) and sigma(k) is their sum (A000203).
%C A334813 The number of terms not exceeding 10^k for k = 1, 2, ... is 3, 36, 426, 4744, 50442, 533806, 5585745, 58013810, 599272790, 6162302702, ... Apparently, this sequence has asymptotic density ~0.6.
%C A334813 Includes all the primes p such that (p+1)/2 is an odd prime, i.e., A005383 without the first term 3.
%C A334813 If p is in A240971 then p^2 is a term.

%e A334813 5 is a term since sigma(5)/d(5) = 6/2 = 3 is an integer, and so is sigma(3)/d(3) = 4/2 = 2.
