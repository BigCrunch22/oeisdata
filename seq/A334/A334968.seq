%N A334968 Number of possible sums of subsequences (not necessarily contiguous) of the n-th composition in standard order (A066099).
%C A334968 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%F A334968 a(n) = A299701(A333219(n)).
%e A334968 The 139th composition is (4,2,1,1), with possible sums of subsequences {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, so a(139) = 9.
