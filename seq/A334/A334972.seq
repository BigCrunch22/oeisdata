%N A334972 Bi-unitary admirable numbers: numbers k such that there is a proper bi-unitary divisor d of k such that bsigma(k) - 2*d = 2*k, where bsigma is the sum of bi-unitary divisors function (A188999).
%C A334972 Equivalently, numbers that are equal to the sum of their proper bi-unitary divisors, with one of them taken with a minus sign.
%C A334972 Admirable numbers (A111592) that are exponentially odd (A268335) are also bi-unitary admirable numbers since all of their divisors are bi-unitary. Terms that are not exponentially odd are 48, 80, 150, 162, 294, 360, 420, 448, 540, 630, 660, 720, 726, 780, 832, 990, ...

%e A334972 48 is in the sequence since 48 = 1 + 2 + 3 - 6 + 8 + 16 + 24 is the sum of its proper bi-unitary divisors with one of them, 6, taken with a minus sign.
