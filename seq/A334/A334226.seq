%N A334226 a(n) is the number of times that the number 3*k+1 from the Collatz trajectory of n is greater than n.
%C A334226 The Collatz trajectory of the number n is a sequence starting with n and ending with 1 (obtained for the first time), constructed using even steps k to k/2 and odd steps k to 3*k+1. a(n) is the number of times in the Collatz trajectory of n that the number 3*k+1, obtained after the odd step k to 3*k+1, is greater than n. Alternatively, a(n) represents the number of odd terms in the Collatz trajectory of n that are greater than (n-1)/3. a(1)=0 since the Collatz trajectory of 1 has no steps.

%e A334226 The Collatz trajectory of n=3 is 3, (10), 5, (16), 8, 4, 2, 1. It happens twice that the number 3*k+1 in this process is greater than n (those numbers 3*k+1 are in parentheses), so a(3)=2.
