%N A334413 First differences of A101803.
%C A334413 This is a non-homogenous Sturmian word, conjectured to be produced by the following recurrence relation: string S(0)=1; S(1)=10; S(n+2)=S(n+1)S(n)* for all natural n, where S(n)* denotes the reverse of S(n); a=S(infinity). Equivalently, a(n) is conjectured to be the fixed point of the morphism 0->101, 1->10101. See "A characterization of the quadratic irrationals."
%C A334413 Relatively long parts of this sequence appear in other OEIS sequences, but it does not appear that any of them match this sequence with only a different prefix. However, arbitrarily long subsequences appear to be contained within A005614. A rigorous proof is still needed, but the key steps are that, thanks to the Equidistribution Theorem, multiples of 1/phi come arbitrarily close to half-integers, and round(r)=floor(r+1/2) for all real r.
%C A334413 From _Michel Dekking_, Aug 31 2020: (Start)
%C A334413 Here is the rigorous proof and a precise version of the previous comment.
%C A334413 Since round(n*(phi-1)) = round(n*phi) - n, this sequence essentially already occurs in the OEIS: a(n) = A006340(n) - 1 for n = 0,1,....
%C A334413 The proof that (a(n)) is the fixed point of the morphism  mu: 0->101, 1->10101 is given in my comments in A006340 from Mar 05 2018.
%C A334413 Let y = A005614 be the binary complement of the Fibonacci word. By definition, y is the fixed point of the morphism nu: 0->1, 1->10.
%C A334413 Claim: (a(n)) and y generate the same language, i.e., any subword of (a(n)) occurs in y, and conversely.
%C A334413 For a proof, consider the cube of the morphism nu: lambda:=nu^3: 0->101, 1->10110.
%C A334413 The crux is that mu and lambda are conjugate morphisms, i.e., there exists a word w such that lambda(v) w = w mu(v) for all words v. One can take w = 101, and it suffices to check this for v=0 and v=1.
