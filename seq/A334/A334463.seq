%N A334463 a(n) is the sum of all parts of all partitions of n into consecutive parts that differ by 3.
%C A334463 The one-part partition n = n is included in the count.
%F A334463 a(n) = n*A117277(n).
%e A334463 For n = 21 there are three partitions of 21 into consecutive parts that differ by 3, including 21 as a valid partition. They are [21], [12, 9] and [10, 7, 4]. The sum of the parts is [21] + [12 + 9] + [10 + 7 + 4] = 63, the same as 3*21 = 63, since there are three of these partitions of 21, so a(21) = 63.
