%N A334911 Census-taker numbers: Numbers k such that exactly two unordered triples of positive numbers have product k and equal sums.
%C A334911 First differs from A060292 at n = 4.
%C A334911 If neither of the two unordered triples contains a 1, then the corresponding term is also in A337080. - _Matej Veselovac_, Sep 14 2020

%e A334911 36 = 6*6*1 = 9*2*2. 6+6+1 = 9+2+2. So 36 is in the sequence.
%e A334911 This example also explains the name of the sequence:
%e A334911 "A census taker knocks on a door. A mother answers.
%e A334911 The census taker says, "I need to know the number of children you have, and their ages." The woman responds in puzzle-ese, "I have three daughters, the product of their ages is 36, and the sum of their ages is equal to the house number next door."
%e A334911 The census taker, who never wastes questions, computes for a while and then asks, "Does your oldest daughter love dogs?" The mother answers affirmatively. The census taker says, "Thank you. I now know the ages."
%e A334911 What are the ages of the children?" (Garces and Loyola 2010, 28)
%e A334911 3264 is not in the sequence: (34, 32, 3) and (48, 17, 4) give sum 69, but (48, 34, 2), (64, 17, 3) and (68, 12, 4) give sum 84.
