%N A334829 The sum a(n) + a(n+1) is visible around the comma that follows a(n+1). See the Comments and Example sections for details.
%C A334829 The rule used here is that the rightmost digit of a(n+1) is the first digit of the sum a(n) + a(n+1), the other digits of the said sum being put after the comma in order to start a(n+2).
%C A334829 As no digit 0 (zero) can start a term, one will have to backtrack sometimes in order to extend the sequence - and pick another term for a(n+1), compatible with the above rule. This is always possible.
%C A334829 Note that the sequence is not monotonically increasing as shown by a(10) and a(11) for instance; still, the 1000th term is 406-digit long.
%C A334829 The sequence is always extended with the smallest available integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction.
