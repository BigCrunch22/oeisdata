%N A334224 Consider a graph as defined in A306302 formed from a row of n adjacent congruent squares with the diagonals of all possible rectangles; a(n) is the minimum edge length of the squares such that the vertices formed by all intersections have integer x and y coordinates.
%F A334224 a(n) = A003418(2n-1) = A076100(n) for n>1.
%e A334224 a(1) = 2 as for a single square, with its bottom left corner at the origin, with both diagonals drawn the intersection point of those lines is at (L/2,L/2) where L is the edge length. Thus L=2 for this to have integer coordinates.
%e A334224 a(2) = 6 as for two vertically adjacent squares the seven intersection points of the diagonals and shared internal edge have coordinates (L/3,4L/3),(L/2,3L/2),(2L/3,4L/3),(L/2,L),(L/3,2L/3),(L/2,L/2),(2L/3,2L/3). Thus L=6, the lowest common multiple of the denominators, for all these points to have integer coordinates.
