%e A334344 2 is a term since its binary weight is 1 and 2/1 = 2, which is a prime number.
%e A334344 6 (110 in binary) has a binary weight of 2 and 6/2 = 3, which is prime, so 6 is also in the sequence. Likewise 10 (1010 in binary) also has a binary weight of 2, and 10/2 = 5, which is prime, so 10 is also in the sequence.
%e A334344 14 (1110 in binary) has binary weight of 3. But 14/3 is not prime, so 14 is not in the sequence.
