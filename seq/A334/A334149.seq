%N A334149 a(n) is the number of terms required beyond the starting value n before a value larger than n first appears when following the same rules as Recamán's sequence A005132 but starting at n instead of 0.
%C A334149 For 100 <= n <= 100000 the largest number of terms to surpass the starting value n is for n = 97646 which takes 26867 terms to surpass 97646, see the link image. The longest in terms of ratio of terms required compared to starting value is for n = 133 which takes 80 terms, see the link image. The shortest ratio is for n = 82148 which only takes 8587, see the link image.
%C A334149 The first repeated number in each sequence starting from n is given in A334148.
%C A334149 The number of terms in each sequence starting from n required to reach the first repeated number is given in A334219.

%e A334149 a(0) = 1 as a(0) corresponds to the standard Recamán's sequence A005132 in which the first term is 0 and it only takes one more term to reach 1 and surpass the start value.
%e A334149 a(4) = 5 as starting from 4 the sequence of visited numbers is 4,3,1,4,0,5 and it takes five more terms to reach 5 and surpass the start value 4.
%e A334149 a(12) = 10 as starting from 12 the sequence of visited numbers is 12,11,9,6,2,7,1,8,0,9,19 and it takes ten more terms to reach 19 and surpass the start value 12.
