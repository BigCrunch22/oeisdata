%N A334974 Infinitary admirable numbers: numbers k such that there is a proper infinitary divisor d of k such that isigma(k) - 2*d = 2*k, where isigma is the sum of infinitary divisors function (A049417).
%C A334974 Equivalently, numbers that are equal to the sum of their proper infinitary divisors, with one of them taken with a minus sign.
%C A334974 Admirable numbers (A111592) whose number of divisors is a power of 2 (A036537) are also infinitary admirable numbers, since all of their divisors are infinitary. Terms with number of divisors that is not a power of 2 are 96, 150, 294, 360, 420, 486, 540, 630, 660, 726, 780, 960, 990, ...

%e A334974 150 is in the sequence since 150 = 1 + 2 + 3 - 6 + 25 + 50 + 75 is the sum of its proper infinitary divisors with one of them, 6, taken with a minus sign.
