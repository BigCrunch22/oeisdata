%F A334158 a(n) = Sum_{i=1..n} c(i) * c(i-2) * c(2*n-i) * c(2*n-i-2), where c is the prime characteristic (A010051).
%e A334158 a(5) = 1; 2*5 = 10 has one Goldbach partition, (5,5), and 5 = 3 + 2 (both prime).
%e A334158 a(13) = 2; 2*13 = 26 has two Goldbach partitions, (19,7) and (13,13), and 19 = 17 + 2 (primes), 7 = 5 + 2 (primes) and 13 = 11 + 2 (primes).
