%N A334148 a(n) is the first term to repeat when following the same rules as Recamán's sequence A005132 but starting at n instead of 0.
%C A334148 The terms of this sequence grow slowly as n increases and are confined to bands of certain values, see the link image. Between n = 998000 and n = 1000000 the smallest term is 2829 and the largest is 19331.
%C A334148 The number of terms in each sequence starting from n required to reach a(n) is given in A334219.
%C A334148 The values where a(n) = n are given in A334225.
%C A334148 The number of terms in each sequence starting from n required to reach a value greater than n given in A334149.

%e A334148 a(0) = 42 as a(0) corresponds to the standard Recamán's sequence A005132 in which 42 is the first term to repeat, appearing at A005132(20) and then again at A005132(24).
%e A334148 a(3) = 3 as starting from 3 the sequence of visited numbers is 3,2,0,3 and 3 is the first term to repeat.
%e A334148 a(6) = 28 as starting from 6 the sequence of visited numbers is 6,5,3,0,4,9,15,8,16,7,17,28,40,27,13,28 and 28 is the first number to repeat.
