%N A334736 Dimensions d such that the integer lattice Z^d does not contain the vertices of a regular d-simplex.
%C A334736 List contains d such that (1) d is even and d+1 is not a square, or (2) d == 1 (mod 4) and d+1 is not a sum of two squares; proved by Schoenberg.

%e A334736 2 is in the list because there is no equilateral triangle in the plane whose vertices all have integer coordinates.
%e A334736 3 is not in the list because there is a regular tetrahedron in space whose vertices have integer coordinates; e.g. (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (0,0,0).
%Y A334736 Complement of A096315.
