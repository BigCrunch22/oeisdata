%N A334303 Numbers m such that the Thue chromatic number of graph C_m is equal to 4.
%C A334303 The Thue chromatic number of a graph G is the least number k such that there is a nonrepetitive coloring of length k, and no such coloring exists of length < k. (A coloring is nonrepetitive iff there is no path of even length such that the colors in the first half are in the same sequence as the colors in the second half.)
%C A334303 The Thue chromatic number of C_m for any other m > 2 is equal to 3.

%e A334303 5 is in the sequence because at least four colors are needed to make an non-repetitive coloring of C_5.
