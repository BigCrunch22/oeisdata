%N A334219 a(n) is the number of terms beyond the starting value n before a repeated number first appears when following the same rules as Recamán's sequence A005132 but starting at n instead of 0.
%C A334219 The first repeated number in each sequence starting from n is given in A334148.
%C A334219 The number of terms in each sequence starting from n required to reach a value greater than n given in A334149.
%C A334219 Essentially the same as A308419. - _R. J. Mathar_, May 06 2020

%e A334219 a(0) = 24 as a(0) corresponds to the standard Recamán's sequence A005132 in which the term 42 appears at A005132(20) and then again at A005132(24), taking twenty-four terms before the first repeated number appears.
%e A334219 a(4) = 3 as starting from 4 the sequence of visited numbers is 4,3,1,4 and it takes three steps beyond the start value for the first repeated number 4 to appear.
%e A334219 a(6) = 15 as starting from 6 the sequence of visited numbers is 6,5,3,0,4,9,15,8,16,7,17,28,40,27,13,28 and it takes fifteen steps beyond the start value for the first repeated number 28 to appear.
%Y A334219 Cf. A005132, A308419, A334148, A334149, A334225.
