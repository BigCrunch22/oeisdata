%N A334555 Number of Eulerian orientations in the triangular grid graph with n vertices on each side.
%C A334555 An Eulerian orientation of a graph is an orientation of the edges such that every vertex has in-degree equal to out-degree.
%C A334555 For n > 1, all values are divisible by 2 since reversing the orientation of every arc in a solution gives another solution.

%e A334555 a(2) = 2 since there are two ways to orient the edges of a triangle so that edge vertex has in-degree equal to out-degree.
