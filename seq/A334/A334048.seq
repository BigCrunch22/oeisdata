%N A334048 Primes p that set a new record for the number of bases 1 < b < p for which p is a base-b Wieferich prime and b is not a perfect power.
%C A334048 p is a base-b Wieferich prime iff b^(p-1) == 1 (mod p^2).
%C A334048 Records in A248865 sometimes arise when all the b values (bases) are powers of the same small integer. By excluding powers, we find primes that are Wieferich in many "independent" ways.
%e A334048 Prime 5107 is Wieferich to six bases (under 5107), namely 560, 1209, 1779, 2621, 4295, 4361, none of which are perfect powers. A prime such as 1093 is Wieferich to ten bases, namely 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024; however, when dismissing perfect powers, only one of the ten bases is left. In fact, no prime less than 5107 has six or more bases when perfect powers are dismissed, so 5107 sets a record and is included in this sequence.
