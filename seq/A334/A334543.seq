%N A334543 First occurrences of gaps between primes 6k - 1: gap sizes.
%C A334543 Contains A268928 as a subsequence. First differs from A268928 at a(5)=24.
%C A334543 Conjecture: the sequence is a permutation of all positive multiples of 6, i.e., all positive terms of A008588.
%C A334543 Conjecture: a(n) = O(n). See arXiv:2002.02115 (sect.7) for discussion.

%F A334543 a(n) = A334545(n) - A334544(n).
%e A334543 The first two primes of the form 6k-1 are 5 and 11, so a(1)=11-5=6. The next primes of this form are 17, 23, 29; the gaps 17-11 = 23-17 = 29-23 have size 6 which already occurred before; so nothing is added to the sequence. The next prime of this form is 41 and the gap 41-29=12 has not occurred before, so a(2)=12.
