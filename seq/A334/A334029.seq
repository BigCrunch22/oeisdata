%N A334029 Length of the co-Lyndon factorization of the k-th composition in standard order.
%C A334029 We define the co-Lyndon product of two or more finite sequences to be the lexicographically minimal sequence obtainable by shuffling the sequences together. For example, the co-Lyndon product of (2,3,1) with (2,1,3) is (2,1,2,3,1,3), the product of (2,2,1) with (2,1,3) is (2,1,2,2,1,3), and the product of (1,2,2) with (2,1,2,1) is (1,2,1,2,1,2,2). A co-Lyndon word is a finite sequence that is prime with respect to the co-Lyndon product. Equivalently, a co-Lyndon word is a finite sequence that is lexicographically strictly greater than all of its cyclic rotations. Every finite sequence has a unique (orderless) factorization into co-Lyndon words, and if these factors are arranged in a certain order, their concatenation is equal to their co-Lyndon product. For example, (1,0,0,1) has co-Lyndon factorization {(1),(1,0,0)}.
%C A334029 A composition of n is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to n. The k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%e A334029 The 441st composition in standard order is (1,2,1,1,3,1), with co-Lyndon factorization {(1),(3,1),(2,1,1)}, so a(441) = 3.
