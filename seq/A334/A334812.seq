%N A334812 a(0) = 0; a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the square spiral number obtained from the magnitude of the difference between adjacent horizontal and vertical previously visited square numbers. If only one such adjacent square exists then it takes on that square's number.
%C A334812 As all squares are numbered from the difference between square spiral numbers which are either 0 or 1, all terms in the sequence are 0 or 1.
%C A334812 Inspired by Pascal's Spiral A334742.

%e A334812 a(0) = 0; a(1) = 1 by definition.
%e A334812 a(2) = 1 as it only has one adjacent visited square a(1) = 1 so it takes that number.
%e A334812 a(3) = 1 as it has adjacent visited squares a(2) = 1 and a(0) = 0 and the difference between 1 and 0 is 1.
%e A334812 a(7) = 1 as it has adjacent visited squares a(6) = 1 and a(0) = 0 and the difference between 1 and 0 is 1.
%e A334812 a(8) = 0 as it has adjacent visited squares a(7) = 1 and a(1) = 1 and the difference between 1 and 1 is 0.
%e A334812 a(9) = 0 as it only has one adjacent visited square a(8) = 0 so it takes that number.
