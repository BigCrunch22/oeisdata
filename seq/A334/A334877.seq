%N A334877 Number of self-avoiding walks on a 2-dimensional square lattice where the walk consists of steps with incrementing length from 1 to n.
%C A334877 This sequence gives the number of self-avoiding walks on a 2-dimensional square lattice where the walk starts with a step length of 1 which then increments by 1 after each step up until the step length is n.
%C A334877 The first time a collision with a previous step can occur is for n = 6. This can occur in three different ways. For example a walk with steps of length 1,2 and 3 to the right, a step of length 4 upward, then a step of length 5 to the left. A step of length 6 downward would now result in a collision. Requiring six steps before a collision is in contrast to the standard 2D square lattice SAW of A001411 where a collision can occur on the fourth step.
%C A334877 Note that this sequence agrees with a SAW on the diamond lattice, A001394, for the first 7 terms, even though the seventh term here has some walks removed due to the above collision.

%e A334877 a(1) = 4. These are the four directions one can step away from a point on a 2D square lattice.
