%N A334969 Heinz numbers of alternately strong integer partitions.
%C A334969 First differs from A304678 in lacking 450.
%C A334969 First differs from A316529 (the totally strong version) in having 150.
%C A334969 A sequence is alternately strong if either it is empty, equal to (1), or its run-lengths are weakly decreasing (strong) and, when reversed, are themselves an alternately strong sequence.
%C A334969 The Heinz number of an integer partition (y_1,...,y_k) is prime(y_1)*...*prime(y_k). This gives a bijective correspondence between positive integers and integer partitions.
%e A334969 The sequence does not contain 450, the Heinz number of (3,3,2,2,1), because, while the multiplicities are weakly decreasing, their reverse (1,2,2) does not have weakly decreasing multiplicities.

%Y A334969 The co-strong version is A317257.
%Y A334969 The case of reversed partitions is (also) A317257.
%Y A334969 The total version is A316529.
%Y A334969 These partitions are counted by A332339.
%Y A334969 Totally co-strong partitions are counted by A332275.
%Y A334969 Alternately co-strong compositions are counted by A332338.
