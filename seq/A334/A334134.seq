%N A334134 Number of integer-sided triangles with perimeter n whose side lengths can be written as the sum of two primes in the same number of ways.

%F A334134 a(n) = Sum_{k=1..floor(n/3)} Sum_{i=k..floor((n-k)/2)} sign(floor((i+k)/(n-i-k+1))) * [c(i) = c(k) = c(n-i-k)], where [] is the Iverson bracket and c = A061358.
%e A334134 a(4) = 0; no triangles can be made.
%e A334134 a(7) = 2; The two triangles [1,3,3] and [2,2,3] both have perimeter 7, and in each case, the side lengths can be written as the sum of two primes in the same number of ways (0 ways).
%e A334134 a(12) = 1; The triangle [4,4,4] has perimeter 12 and all of its side lengths can be written as the sum of two primes in the same number of ways (1 way).
%e A334134 a(15) = 3; the triangles [4,4,7], [4,5,6] and [5,5,5] all have perimeter 15. In each triangle, all the side lengths can be written as the sum of two primes in the same number of ways (1 way).
