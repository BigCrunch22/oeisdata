%N A334462 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of parts in the partition of n into k consecutive parts that differ by 4, n >= 1, k >= 1, and the first element of column k is in the row that is the k-th hexagonal number (A000384).
%C A334462 Since the trivial partition n is counted, so T(n,1) = 1.
%C A334462 This is also an irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k), n >= 1, k >= 1, in which column k lists k's interleaved with k-1 zeros, and the first element of column k is in the row that is the k-th hexagonal number.
%C A334462 This triangle can be represented with a diagram of overlapping curves, in which every column of triangle is represented by a periodic curve.
%C A334462 For a general theorem about the triangles of this family see A285914.
%F A334462 T(n,k) = k*A334460(n,k).

%e A334462 For n = 28 there are three partitions of 28 into consecutive parts that differ by 4, including 28 as a valid partition. They are [28], [16, 12] and [13, 9, 5, 1]. The number of parts of these partitions are 1, 2, 4 respectively, so the 28th row of the triangle is [1, 2, 0, 4].
%Y A334462 Triangles of the same family where the parts differ by d are A127093 (d=0), A285914 (d=1), A330466 (d=2), A330888 (d=3), this sequence (d=4), A334540 (d=5).
