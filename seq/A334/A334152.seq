%F A334152 a(n) = Sum_{i=1..n} [c(i-2) = c(2*n-i-2)] * c(i) * c(2*n-i), where [] is the Iverson bracket and c is the prime characteristic (A010051).
%e A334152 a(6) = 1; 2*6 = 12 has one Goldbach partition, (7,5), such that 7-2 = 5 and 5-2 = 3 (both prime).
%e A334152 a(7) = 2; 2*7 = 14 has two Goldbach partitions, (11,3) and (7,7), such that 11-2 = 9 and 3-2 = 1 (both not prime) as well as 7-2 = 5 (both prime).
