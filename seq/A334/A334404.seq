%N A334404 a(0)=0; for n>0, a(n) is an integer not previously seen such that the sum of all previous terms plus a(n) equals the smallest prime number not yet created by any previous sum.
%C A334404 See A175499 for an equivalent sequence which sums to the smallest positive integer not yet created.
%e A334404 a(1) = 2 as the sum of all previous terms plus a(1) = 0 + 2 = 2, where 2 has not previously occurred in the sequence and the prime 2 has not been previously created.
%e A334404 a(2) = 1 as the sum of all previous terms plus a(2) = 0 + 2 + 1 = 3, where 1 has not previously occurred in the sequence and the prime 3 has not been previously created.
%e A334404 a(3) = 4 as the sum of all previous terms plus a(3) = 0 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 7, where 4 has not previously occurred in the sequence and the prime 7 has not been previously created. Note that the next smallest uncreated prime after a(2) is 5 but that would require a(3) = 2 which is not allowed as a(1) = 2.
%e A334404 a(4) = -2 as the sum of all previous terms plus a(4) = 0 + 2 + 1 + 4 - 2 = 5, where -2 has not previously occurred in the sequence and the prime 5 has not been previously created.
