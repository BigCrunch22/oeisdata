%N A334495 Position of prime(n) in A045572, a(1) = a(3) = 0.
%C A334495 A045572 contains the positive numbers coprime to 10.
%C A334495 Nondivisor primes p (i.e., all primes except p | 10, that is, 2 or 5) belong to one of four residues r (i.e., 1, 3, 7, 9) in the reduced residue system mod 10. Therefore all primes aside from 2 and 5 appear in A045572. On account of this fact, one may use A045572 as a sort of prime sieve. This use is less efficient than searching for primes aside from 2 and 3 amid numbers that are +/-1 (mod 6), i.e., in A007310, and slightly more efficient than searching for primes aside from 2 amid the odd numbers, but in line with the common (decimal) base.
%F A334495 For prime p_n for n =/= 1 nor n =/= 3, a(p_n) = 4*q + (r + 1)/2 - [r > 5] (Iverson brackets), where q = floor(p_n/10) and r = p_n mod 10.
%e A334495 a(1) = a(3) = 0 by definition, since 2 and 5 are not in A045572.
%e A334495 a(2) = 2 since A045572(2) = 3, a(10) = 12 since prime(10) = 29 = A045572(12), etc.
