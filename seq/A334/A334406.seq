%N A334406 Unitary pseudoperfect numbers k such that there is a subset of unitary divisors of k whose sum is 2*k and for each d in this subset k/d is also in it.
%C A334406 Includes all the unitary perfect numbers (A002827).
%C A334406 The squarefree terms of A334405 are also terms of this sequence. Terms that are not squarefree are 60, 90, 660, 4620, 5460, 6930, 7140, 7980, 8190, 8580, 9240, 9660, ...
