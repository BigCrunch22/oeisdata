%N A334540 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of parts in the partition of n into k consecutive parts that differ by 5, n >= 1, k >= 1, and the first element of column k is in the row that is the k-th heptagonal number (A000566).
%C A334540 Since the trivial partition n is counted, so T(n,1) = 1.
%C A334540 This is an irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k), n >= 1, k >= 1, in which column k lists k's interleaved with k-1 zeros, and the first element of column k is in the row that is the k-th heptagonal number.
%C A334540 This triangle can be represented with a diagram of overlapping curves, in which every column of triangle is represented by a periodic curve.
%C A334540 For a general theorem about the triangles of this family see A285914.
%F A334540 T(n,k) = k*A334465(n,k).

%e A334540 For n = 27 there are three partitions of 27 into consecutive parts that differ by 5, including 27 as a valid partition. They are [27], [16, 11] and [14, 9, 4]. The number of parts of these partitions are 1, 2, 3 respectively, so the 27th row of the triangle is [1, 2, 3].
