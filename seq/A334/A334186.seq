%N A334186 Let m = d*q + r be the Euclidean division of m by d. The terms m of this sequence satisfy that r, q, d are consecutive positive integer terms in a geometric progression with a noninteger common ratio > 1.
%C A334186 Inspired by the problem 141 of Project Euler (see the link).
%C A334186 If b is the fractional common ratio, then b = p/s irreducible > 1 and r > 0.
%C A334186 To get r, d, q as integers, it is necessary that r is a multiple of s^2; in this case, if r = s^2 *r' with r' >= 1, q = p*s*r' and d = p^2*r', then every m =  s*r' * (s+p^3*r') with p/s>1 is a term, and the Euclidean division becomes : s*r' * (s+p^3*r') = (p^2*r') * (p*s*r') + s^2*r'.  The integers (s^2*r', p*s*r', p^2*r') are in geometric progression.
%C A334186 When (r<q<d) is solution with m = d * q + r, then, with d' = q and q' = d, m = d' * q' + r and (r<d'<q') is also a solution with another order between remainder, divisor and quotient (see last example).
%C A334186 m is a term iff m = s*r' * (s+p^3*r') with r' >= 1 and p > s, p no multiple of s. For every irreducible ratio b = p/s, there are infinitely many terms.
