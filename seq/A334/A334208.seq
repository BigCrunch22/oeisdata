%N A334208 Number of partitions of 2n into two composite parts, (r,s), such that r and s have the same number of primes less than or equal to them.
%C A334208 Apparently a(n) = A051699(n) for n>=2. - _R. J. Mathar_, Apr 22 2020

%F A334208 a(n) = Sum_{i=2..n} [pi(i) = pi(2*n-i)] * (1 - c(i)) * (1 - c(2*n-i)), where [] is the Iverson bracket, pi is the prime counting function (A000720), and c is the prime characteristic (A010051).
%e A334208 a(9) = 2; 2*9 = 18 has two partitions into composite parts, (10,8) and (9,9), such that pi(10) = 4 = pi(8) and pi(9) = 4 = pi(9).
%t A334208 Table[Sum[KroneckerDelta[PrimePi[i], PrimePi[2 n - i]] (1 - PrimePi[i] + PrimePi[i - 1]) (1 - PrimePi[2 n - i] + PrimePi[2 n - i - 1]), {i, 2, n}], {n, 100}]
