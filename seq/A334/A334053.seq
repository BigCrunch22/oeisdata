%N A334053 Least b such that b^(2^n) + 1 is a Proth prime (A080076).
%C A334053 Every term b is in A116882 (the prime factor 2 of b must account for more than the square root of b).
%C A334053 For n up to about 11, a(n) can be found with the PARI function below. From there up to n=14, you can find a(n) by filtering lists of known primes of the form b^(2^n) + 1.
