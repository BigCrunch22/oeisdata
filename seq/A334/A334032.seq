%N A334032 The a(n)-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic) is the unsorted prime signature of n.
%C A334032 Unsorted prime signature (A124010) is the sequence of exponents in a number's prime factorization.
%C A334032 The k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%F A334032 a(A057335(n)) = n.
%F A334032 A057335(a(n)) = A071364(n).
%F A334032 a(A334031(n))= A059893(n).
%F A334032 A334031(a(n)) = A331580(n).
%e A334032 The unsorted prime signature of 12345678 is (1,2,1,1), which is the 27th composition in standard order, so a(12345678) = 27.
