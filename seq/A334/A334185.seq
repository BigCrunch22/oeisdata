%N A334185 Let m = d*q + r be the Euclidean division of m by d. The terms m of this sequence satisfy that r, q, d are consecutive positive integer terms in a geometric progression with a common integer ratio.
%C A334185 Inspired by the problem 141 of Project Euler (see the link).
%C A334185 If b is the common ratio, then b is an integer >= 2.
%C A334185 So, when b >= 2 and r >= 1, q=r*b, d=r*b^2, then every m = r * (1+r*b^3) is a term, and the division becomes: r*(1+r*b^3) = (r*b^2) * (r*b) + r. The integers (r, r*b, r*b^2) are in geometric progression.
%C A334185 When (r < q < d) is solution with m = d * q + r, then, with d' = q and q' = d, m = d' * q' + r and (r < d' < q') is also a solution with another order between remainder, divisor and quotient (see last example).
%C A334185 m is a term if m = r * (1+r*b^3) with r >= 1 and b >= 2; so, when r = 1, A001093(n) for n > 1 are terms (see 1st example).
