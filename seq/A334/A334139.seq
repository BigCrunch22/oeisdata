%N A334139 Numbers that are equal to the LCM of their palindromic divisors.
%C A334139 These terms are the fixed points of A087999.
%C A334139 All the palindromes are in the sequence.
%C A334139 Now, if m is non-palindromic, then m is a term iff m = q_1^r_1 *...* q_i^r_i *...* q_k^r_k, where q_1 <...<q_i <...<q_k are primes, k>=2, r_i >= 1 and every divisor q_i^r_i is a palindrome; these q_i^r_i are in A084092 (see examples).
%C A334139 The first 40 terms, from 1 to 99, are exactly the 40 smallest divisors of 27720, hence the first 40 terms of A178864, but this sequence, which is infinite, is not a duplicate. Also, 27720 is in this sequence.
%e A334139 2, 5, 131 are terms as palindromic primes.
%e A334139 111 = 3 * 37 is a term because 111 is a palindrome, so LCM(1,3,37,111) = 111.
%e A334139 27720 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 11, every 2^3=8, 3^2=9, 5, 7, 11 is a palindrome so 27720 is another term, no palindromic.
