%N A334953 a(n) is the sum of all parts of all partitions of n into consecutive parts that differ by 6.
%C A334953 The one-part partition n = n is included in the count.
%F A334953 a(n) = n*A334948(n).
%e A334953 For n = 24 there are three partitions of 24 into consecutive parts that differ by 6, including 24 as a valid partition. They are [24], [15, 9] and [14, 8, 2]. The sum of all parts is [24] + [15 + 9] + [14 + 8 + 2] = 72, so a(24) = 72.
%Y A334953 Sequences of the same family where the parts differs by k are: A038040 (k=0), A245579 (k=1), A060872 (k=2), A334463 (k=3), A327262 (k=4), A334733 (k=5), this sequence (k=6).
