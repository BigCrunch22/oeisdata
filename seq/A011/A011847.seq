%N A011847 Triangle of numbers read by rows: T(n,k) = floor( C(n,k)/(k+1) ), where k=0..n-1 and n >= 1.
%C A011847 When k+1 is a prime >= 2, then T(n,k) = floor(C(n,k)/(k+1)) is the number of aperiodic necklaces of n+1 beads of 2 colors such that k+1 of them are black and n-k of them are white. This is not true when k+1 is a composite >= 4. For more details, see the comments for sequences A032168 and A032169. - _Petros Hadjicostas_, Aug 27 2018

%e A011847 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Aug 27 2018: (Start)
%e A011847 For k+1 = 2 and n >= k+1 = 2, the n-th element of column k=1 above, [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, ...] (i.e., the number A008619(n-2) = floor(n/2)), gives the number of aperiodic necklaces of n+1 beads of 2 colors such that 2 of them are black and n-1 of them are white. (The offset of sequence A008619 is 0.)
%e A011847 For k+1 = 3 and n >= k+1 = 3, the n-th element of column k=2 above, [0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, ...] (i.e., the number A001840(n-2) = floor(C(n,2)/3)), gives the number of aperiodic necklaces of n+1 beads of 2 colors such that 3 of them are black and n-2 of them are white. (The offset of sequence A001840 is 0.)
%e A011847 For k+1 = 5 and n >= k+1 = 5, the n-th element of column k=4 above, [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 25, 42, ... ] (i.e., the number A011795(n) = floor(C(n,4)/5)), gives the number of aperiodic necklaces of n+1 beads of 2 colors such that 5 of them are black and n-4 of them are white. (The offset of sequence A011795 is 0.)
%e A011847 Counterexample for k+1 = 4: It can be proved that, for n >= k+1 = 4, the number of aperiodic necklaces of n+1 beads of 2 colors such that 4 of them are black and n-3 of them are white is (1/4)*Sum_{d|4} mu(d)*I(d|n+1)*C(floor((n+1)/d) - 1, 4/d - 1) = (1/4)*(C(n, 3) - I(2|n+1)*floor((n-1)/2)), where I(a|b) = 1 if integer a divides integer b, and 0 otherwise. For n odd >= 9, the number (1/4)*(C(n, 3) - I(2|n+1)*floor((n-1)/2)) = A006918(n-3) is not equal to floor(C(n,3)/4) = A011842(n).
