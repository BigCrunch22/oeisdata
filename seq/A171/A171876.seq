%N A171876 Mutual solutions to two classification counting problems: binary block codes of wordlength J with N used words; and classifications of N elements by J partitions.
%C A171876 This connection was conjectured by _Robert Munafo_, then proved by _Andrew Weimholt_.
%C A171876 A(n) counts 2-colorings of a J-dimensional hypercube with N red vertices and 2^J-N black, each edge has at most one red vertex. - _Andrew Weimholt_, Dec 30 2009
