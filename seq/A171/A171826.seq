%N A171826 Nonnegative integers that can be made using exactly three threes (3 3's) and the four basic operators {+, -, *, /}.
%C A171826 More integers can be made using 3 3's if more operators are allowed (i.e., 1 = 3^(3-3) or 5 = 3! - 3/3). Note that 1 = 3/3 but the sequence requires to use exactly three threes and it's not possible to "get rid" of the third three.
