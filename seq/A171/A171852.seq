%N A171852 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of peakless Motzkin paths of length n having trapezoid weight k (n>=0, k>=0).
%C A171852 A trapezoid in a peakless Motzkin path is a factor of the form U^i H^j D^i (i, j>=1), i being the height of the trapezoid and U=(1,1), H=(1,0), D=(1,-1). A trapezoid in a peakless Motzkin path w is maximal if, as a factor in w, it is not immediately preceded by a U and immediately followed by a D. The trapezoid weight of a peakless Motzkin path is the sum of the heights of its maximal trapezoids. For example, in the peakless Motzkin path w=UH(UHD)D(UUHHDD) we have two maximal trapezoids (shown between parentheses) of heights 1 and 2, respectively. The trapezoid weight of w is 1+2=3. This concept is analogous to the concept of pyramid weight in a Dyck path (see the Denise-Simion paper).
%C A171852 The number of terms in rows 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,... is 1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,..., respectively.
%C A171852 The sum of the entries in row n is A004148(n) (the secondary structure numbers).
%C A171852 Sum(k*T(n,k), k>=0) = A171853(n).

%F A171852 The g.f. G=G(t,z) satisfies G = 1 + z*G + z^2*G*(G - 1 + z*(t - 1)/((1 - z)*(1 - t*z^2))).
%e A171852 T(4,1)=3 because each of the paths HUHD, UHHD and UHDH has trapezoid weight 1.
