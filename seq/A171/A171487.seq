%N A171487 Product of odd prime anti-factors < n, with multiplicity.
%C A171487 Anti-factor is here defined as almost synonym with anti-divisor (except without the restriction of being less than n for anti-divisor.) ODD p^k is anti-factor (<n or >n) of n iff p^i, 1<=i<=k are anti-factors of n (note that this only applies to ODD anti-factors.)
%C A171487 In this sequence p < n, but p^k with k>=2 may be larger than n.
%C A171487 a(n) = 1 iff 2n-1 and 2n+1 are twin primes;
%C A171487 a(n) = 2n-1 iff 2n-1 is composite, 2n+1 is prime;
%C A171487 a(n) = 2n+1 iff 2n-1 is prime, 2n+1 is composite;
%C A171487 a(n) = (2n-1)(2n+1) iff 2n-1 and 2n+1 are both composite.

%F A171487 a(n) = {product of odd prime factors < 2n-1 of 2n-1, with multiplicity} * {product of odd prime factors < 2n+1 of 2n+1, with multiplicity}
%F A171487 GCD(a(n), a(n+1)) = {product of odd prime factors < 2n+1 of 2n+1, with multiplicity} (cf. A171435)
%e A171487 3 is an anti-factor (and anti-divisor) of 5, and 3^2=9 is also an anti-factor (but not an anti-divisor since > 5) of 5.
