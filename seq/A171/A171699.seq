%N A171699 Square array of number of distinct m X n (0,1) matrices after iterated double sorting, read by antidiagonals.
%C A171699 T(m,n) gives the number of distinct results obtained by repeatedly sorting the m X n (0,1) matrices by columns & then rows until reaching a fixed point. Its diagonal is A089006.
