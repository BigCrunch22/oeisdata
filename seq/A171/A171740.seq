%N A171740 The first number palindromic with n digits in more than one base (shown in base 10).
%C A171740 This sequence gives the first value (represented in base 10) that is palindromic -- i.e., the same when its digits are reflected about the center -- with n >= 1 digits in two different bases.
%C A171740 Currently waiting on doubly 18-palindrome.  The 19-palindrome is one in bases 10 and 11, 6411682614162861146 in base 10.  For some time I was laboring under the impression that the new terms now added -- starting at 9-palindromes -- were too difficult to find, thinking a change I recently made would not increase programming efficiency as much as it did. The results come from the research done for the sequences labeled with A216*** shown below.  The other cross-referenced sequences, A171***, deal with higher orders of multiplicity and such things. - _James G. Merickel_, Sep 19 2012
