%N A171871 Triangle read by rows: Distinct classifications of N elements containing exactly R binary partitions.
%C A171871 Significance of triangle suggested by _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_ on Dec 19 2009. Row N has N terms in this sequence. The triangle starts:
%C A171871   1;
%C A171871   0,  1;
%C A171871   0,  0,  1;
%C A171871   0,  0,  1,  2;
%C A171871   0,  0,  0,  3,  3;
%C A171871   0,  0,  0,  0,  3, 17,  6;
%C A171871   0,  0,  0,  0,  1, 36, 74, 11;
%C A171871 Value is A000055(N) when R=N-1 (last term in each row). (Conjectured by _Robert Munafo_ Dec 28 2009, then proved by _Andrew Weimholt_ and _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_ on Dec 29 2009)
%C A171871 Value is 1 when N=2^R.
%C A171871 Value is 1 when N=(2^R)-1.
%C A171871 Value is R when R>2 and N=(2^R)-2.
%C A171871 Value is A034198(R) when R>2 and N=(2^R)-3.
%C A171871 Conjecture: In general, in each column, the last 2^(R-1) values are the same as the first 2^(N-1) values from the corresponding row of A039754. - _Robert Munafo_, Dec 30 2009
%C A171871 Value is 0 for all (N,R) for which N is greater than 2^R.
%C A171871 Each term A(N,R) can be computed most efficiently by first enumerating all classifications in A(N-1,R) plus those in A(N-1,R-1), and then adding an additional type and/or partition to each.
