%N A171245 Reciprocals of the deviation of continued fraction convergents from Pi.
%C A171245 Clearly the terms alternate in sign, but the initial choice of sign was arbitrary.
%e A171245 The first convergent to Pi, 3, is just over 1/7 too low, so 7 is the first term.
%e A171245 The second convergent, 22/7, is 0.001264+ too high, which is just over 1/790, so -790 is the second term.
%o A171245 (PARI) for(x=1,10,t=contfracpnqn(contfrac(Pi,x));print(truncate(1/(Pi-t[1,1]/t[2,1]))))
%Y A171245 Cf. A001203.
