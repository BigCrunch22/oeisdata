%N A171708 Numbers k such that the k-th prime of the form 6*k-1 and the k-th prime of the form 6*k+1 are a pair of twin primes.
%F A171708 {n: A007528(n) + 2 = A002476(n)}. A171713(n) = A007528(a(n)). - _R. J. Mathar_, Jun 07 2010
%e A171708 1 is in the sequence because the 1st primes of the forms 6*k-1 and 6*k+1(6*1-1=5 and 6*1+1=7, respectively) are a pair of twin primes;
%e A171708 2 is in the sequence because the 2nd primes (6*2-1=11 and 6*2+1=13) are a pair of twin primes;
%e A171708 3 is in the sequence because the 3rd primes (6*3-1=17 and 6*3+1=19) are a pair of twin primes;
%e A171708 6 is in the sequence because the 6th primes (6*7-1=41 and 6*7+1=43) are a pair of twin primes;
%e A171708 24 is in the sequence because the 24th primes (6*38-1=227 and 6*38+1=229) are a pair of twin primes.
