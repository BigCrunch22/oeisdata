%N A171465 Lexicographically earliest positive integer sequence such that no sum of consecutive terms is a positive square.
%C A171465 Let T(a) be the sequence of all positive integers (in order of increasing magnitude) that are not a sum of any number of consecutive terms of a, and let s be the sequence of positive squares. An interesting question is whether T(a) = s. Calculation shows that if 100 terms of a are used then T(a) agrees with s for the first 13 terms; if 1000 terms of a are used then T(a) agrees with s for the first 57 terms.
