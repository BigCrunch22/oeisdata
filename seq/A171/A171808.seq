%N A171808 Number of 5 X 5 permutation matrices such that the n-th matrix power is the identity matrix and the determinant is +1.
%C A171808 Sum of this sequence is equal to the number of permutation matrices with determinant +1 = 5!/2 = 60. For number matrices with determinant = -1 see A171809.
%e A171808 a(1)=1 because there is only one matrix whose first power is the identity matrix (this is the identity matrix itself).
%Y A171808 Cf. A171806, A171809.
