%C A171074 From a variant of the tennis ball problem (cf. A031970, A049235). On turn n ball 2n-1 is introduced to the room, ball 2n is introduced to the garden, then one of the balls in the room is swapped with one of the balls in the garden. The present sequence gives the number of combinations, while A171075 gives the total on the lawn, A170076 gives the total in the room.
