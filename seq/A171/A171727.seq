%N A171727 The number of twin prime pairs in the interval (p^2,p*q), where (p,q) runs over the twin prime pairs (A001359(n),A006512(n)).
%C A171727 If you graph the order of the twin primes along the x-axis (i.e., first twin, second, third, ...) and the number of twins in the sequence given above along the y-axis, a clear pattern emerges. As you go farther along the x-axis, the number of twin primes, on average, within the interval increases. The pattern appears to be nonlinear. If one could prove that there's at least one twin prime within each interval, the twin prime conjecture would be proved since the n-th twin produces larger intervals with more twin primes. The evidence seems overwhelming.

%e A171727 The first twin prime pair (3,5) corresponds to the interval (9,15), which contains one twin prime pair (11,13), so a(1) = 1.
%e A171727 The fifth twin prime pair (29,31) corresponds to the interval (841,899), which contains the twin prime pairs (857,859) and (881,883), so a(5) = 2.
