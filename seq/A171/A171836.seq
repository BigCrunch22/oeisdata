%N A171836 Primes of the form 6n+1 with prime index of the form 6n+1.
%C A171836 This is to primes of form 6n+1 (A002476) as primes with prime subscripts (A006450) is to primes (A000040). Hence this is one of four related sequences into which every prime with prime subscripts (A006450) may be classified: Primes of the form 6n+1 (A002476) with prime index of the form 6n+1; primes of the form 6n+1 with prime index of form 6n-1 (A007528); primes of the form 6n-1 with prime index of the form 6n+1; and primes of form 6n-1 with prime index of the form 6n-1.
%F A171836 a(n) = A002476(A002476(n)).
%e A171836 a(1) = 61 because the smallest prime of form 6n+1 is 6*1+1 = 7, and the seventh prime of the form 6n+1 is 6*10+1 = 61. a(2) = 109 because the second smallest prime of form 6n+1 is 6*2+1 = 13, and the thirteenth prime of the form 6n+1 is 6*18+1 = 109.
