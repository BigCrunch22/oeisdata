%N A171833 Pythagorean primes with Pythagorean prime index.
%C A171833 This is to Pythagorean primes (A002144), primes of the form 4n+1, as primes with prime subscripts (A006450) is to primes (A000040). Hence this is one of four related sequences into which every prime with prime subscripts (A006450) may be classified: Pythagorean primes (A002144) with Pythagorean prime index; Pythagorean primes (A002144) whose indices are of the form 4n+3 (A002145); primes of the form 4n+3 with Pythagorean prime index; and primes of the form 4n+3 whose indices are primes of form 4n+3.
%F A171833 a(n) = A002144(A002144(n)).
%e A171833 a(1) = 37 because the smallest prime of form 4n+1 is 4*1+1 = 5, and the fifth prime of the form 4n+1 is 4*9+1 = 37. a(2) = 109 because the second smallest prime of form 4n+1 is 4*3+1 = 13, and the thirteenth prime of the form 4n+1 is 4*27+1 = 109.
