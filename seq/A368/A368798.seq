%N A368798 Lexicographically earliest sequence of nonnegative integers such that the doubly-infinite symmetric sequence b defined by b(n) = b(-n) = a(n) for any n >= 0 has no three equidistant equal terms.
%C A368798 This sequence is a variant of A006997.
%C A368798 By Van der Waerden's theorem, this sequence is unbounded.

%e A368798 For n = 5:
%e A368798 - the first 5 terms of the sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 2,
%e A368798 - a(5) cannot equal 0 as we would have b(-5) = b(0) = b(5),
%e A368798 - a(5) cannot equal 1 as we would have b(-1) = b(2) = b(5),
%e A368798 - a(5) cannot equal 2 as we would have b(3) = b(4) = b(5),
%e A368798 - we chose a(5) = 3 as this does not induce tree equidistant equal terms.
