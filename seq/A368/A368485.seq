%N A368485 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of positive integers such that for n > 1, a(n - a(n)) is distinct for all indices n with the same a(n) value.
%C A368485 Consider each index i as a location from which one can jump a(i) terms backwards. Any two distinct indices m and k, where a(m)=a(k), will jump to distinct values. In other words, every 1 will jump back to a distinct value, every 2, 3, etc.
%e A368485 We can see, for example, that the values reached by jumping backwards once from each 3 in the sequence are all distinct:
%e A368485   1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, 3
