%N A368103 a(1)=1; for n>1, a(n) is the smallest number not already used which has a factor difference in common with a(n-1).
%C A368103 A factor difference of x is any abs(p-q) where x=p*q (in other words, the difference of a factor pair of x, per A368312).
%C A368103 Prime numbers are among the numbers which appear most delayed in this sequence. - _Thomas Scheuerle_, Dec 12 2023

%H A368103 Thomas Scheuerle, <a href="/A368103/a368103.png">Plot of the first 393 prime numbers over their indices of appearance</a>. It is remarkable that prime numbers do not appear in order.
%e A368103 For n=2, a(1)=1 can be factored only as 1*1, which has difference 0. The next term cannot be 2 and 3 as they do not have a factor difference 0, but 4 = 2*2 does, so that a(2) = 4.
%e A368103 For n=5, a(4)=16 has factor differences 0,6,15 and the smallest unused number with one of those differences is a(5) = 7 = 7*1 difference 6.
