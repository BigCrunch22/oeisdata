%N A368903 Numbers k for which there is no such prime p that p^p would divide A342001(k), but for A003415(k) such a prime exists. Here A003415(n) is the arithmetic derivative of n, and A342001(n) = A003415(n) / A003557(n).
%C A368903 Numbers k such that A342001(k) is in A048103, but A003415(k) is in its complement A100716. The condition implies that k itself is in A100716.
%C A368903 Converse case, where p^p would divide A342001(k) but not A003415(k), is not possible because the former is the divisor of the latter.
%e A368903 For n = 27 = 3^3, A003415(27) = 27, and A342001(27) = 3, thus as 3^3 divides the former, but not the latter, 27 is included in this sequence.
