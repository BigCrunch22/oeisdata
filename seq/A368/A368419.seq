%N A368419 a(n) is the number of reduced stable marriage problem instances of order 5 that generate 16 - n possible stable matchings.
%C A368419 "Reduced" instances are counted, as in A351430 for order 4.
%C A368419 Reduced instances are fewer than all instances by a factor of n!(n-1)! due to participant-renaming isomorphism, analogous to reduced latin squares.
%C A368419 The counts are listed in reverse order from A351430 so that the known terms appear first.  The first term gives the number of maximal instances (with 16 stable matchings, per A357269).
%C A368419 The total number of reduced instances for order 5 is 214990848000000000, given by A351409(5).
%C A368419 The corresponding sequence for order 3 is [91,957,2840], with 91 maximal instances.
%C A368419 a(0) = A368433(5) = A344669(5) / (5! * 4!).
%C A368419 Results were obtained using the MiniZinc constraint modeling language, by extending the "Model for the Stable Marriage Problem" given in the MiniZinc Handbook, Section 2.2.6.
%C A368419 The first two terms were obtained on a PC with 12GB RAM; the next three terms on a PC with 64GB RAM.
