%N A368887 a(n) is the atomic number of the nuclide with the lowest energy among the isobars of mass number n.
%C A368887 Various models agree that a(262) = a(263) = a(264) = 102, while it is unknown whether a(261) = 101 or 102, and whether a(265) = 102 or 103 (note that mendelevium-261, nobelium-261, -263, -264, -265 and lawrencium-265 are all undiscovered).
%C A368887 Note that a(146) = 62 corresponds to the unstable nuclide samarium-146 (which has lower energy) rather than the stable nuclide neodymium-146. Likewise, a(247) = 97 corresponds to the nuclide berkelium-247 instead of curium-247 whose half-life is longer by four orders of magnitude.
%C A368887 A beta-stable nuclide is a nuclide whose beta decay (beta-minus and beta-plus decay) is energetically disallowed; that is to say, a nuclide that has lower energy then its isobars with one more or one less proton. Note that double beta decay is allowed. No terms being equal to 43 or 61 corresponds to the fact that there is no beta-stable isotope of technetium and promethium. Page 12 of the Zagrebaev et al. link predicts further that no terms are equal to 113.

%e A368887 a(5) = 2 because helium-5 has lower energy then hydrogen-5, lithium-5 and (possibly) beryllium-5.
%e A368887 a(147) = 62 because samarium-147 has lower energy than promethium-147, europium-147 and so on.
%e A368887 a(144) = 60 because between neodymium-144 and samarium-144 (the beta-stable isobars with mass number 144), the former has lower energy.
%e A368887 a(148) = 62 because between neodymium-148 and samarium-148 (the beta-stable isobars with mass number 148), the latter has lower energy.
%e A368887 a(212) = 84 because between polonium-212 and radon-212 (the beta-stable isobars with mass number 212), the former has lower energy.
%Y A368887 Cf. A368859 (beta-stable isotopes), A368860 (beta-stable isotones).
