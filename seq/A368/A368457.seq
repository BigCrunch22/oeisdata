%N A368457 a(n) = 2*(Bacher(n) - sigma(n)) + n + 1 = 2*(A368207(n) - A000203(n)) + n + 1.
%C A368457 We can use the Bacher numbers A368207 to measure the primeness of a positive integer, similar to how the number of prime factors of an integer does, but based on the number of representations of n as w*x + y*z where max(w, x) < min(y, z).
%C A368457 Bacher's theorem shows that a(n) = 0 if n is an odd prime. Conversely, if a(n) = 0, we cannot conclude that n is prime as the example n = 35 shows, but this is probably the only exception.
%C A368457 Of the first 32,000 terms, approximately 88% are less than 0, 11% are equal to 0, and 1% are greater than 0. A368458 gives the indices for which a(n) is positive, and A368459 those for which a(n) is negative.
%C A368457 It appears that a(p^2) = p - 1 (A006093) for all prime p, following the observation by Knuth that apparently A368207(p^2) = (p^2 + 3*p)/2.
