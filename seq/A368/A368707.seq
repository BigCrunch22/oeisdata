%N A368707 Number of length-n overlap-free binary words that are squares.
%F A368707 a(2) = 2; a(2^n) = 2^{n-1} for n>=2; a(3*2^n) = 3*2^n for n>=1; a(n) = 0 for all other entries.
%e A368707 The overlap-free words of length 6 are  001001, 010010, 011011, 001011, 001100, 001101, 010011, 010110, 011001, 011010, and their binary complements, but only the first 3 are squares.
