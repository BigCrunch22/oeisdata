%N A368750 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of atoms contained in the k-th balanced string of left/right parentheses of length 2*n, where strings within a row are in reverse lexicographical order.
%C A368750 A balanced string of parentheses is composed of the same number of left and right parentheses. E.g., "(())()" and "))(()(" are balanced, while "((()((()" is not.
%C A368750 An atom is a balanced substring (as short as possible) beginning with "(" and ending with ")", while a co-atom is the reverse of an atom.
%C A368750 To count for the number of atoms/co-atoms, we begin from the leftmost character of the string and proceed to the right, adding 1 to a counter when "(" is encountered, and subtracting 1 when ")" is encountered. Each time the counter reaches 0, we have found either an atom or a co-atom, depending on whether the starting character was a "(" or a ")", respectively.
%C A368750 For example, the string ")(()()(())))((" can be split into ")(" (co-atom), "()" (atom), "()" (atom), "(())" (atom) and "))((" (co-atom).
%C A368750 If ")" is encoded by 0 and "(" is encoded by 1, the triangle with the balanced strings is given by A368804 (and, converted to decimal, by A362030).
