%N A368108 a(1,2,3) = 1,2,3. For n > 3, a(n) is the smallest of the least novel multiples of all primes which divide an earlier term but do not divide a(n-1). If the prime divisors of all prior terms also divide a(n-1), a(n) is the least novel multiple of the smallest prime which does not divide a(n-1).
%C A368108 Conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers with primes in order.
%C A368108 Same as A351495 for the first 13 terms; diverges thereafter.

%F A368108 If a(m) = 2*p where p is a prime > 5 which is not already a term, then a(m+2) = p.
%e A368108 a(4) = 4, least novel multiple of 2, the smallest prime which does not divide 3.
%e A368108 a(5) = 6, least novel multiple of 3, the smallest prime which does not divide 4.
%e A368108 There is only one occasion where the second condition of the definition applies, namely a(5) = 6, where 2 and 3 have already occurred; therefore a(6) = 5, the smallest prime which does not divide 6.
%e A368108 a(7) = 8 since 2 and 3 do not divide 5, and their least novel multiples are 8, and 9 respectively.
%e A368108 Since a(7) = 8, a(8) is the least novel multiple of 3 (9) or 5 (10), so a(8) = 9.
%e A368108 a(13) = 18 and 5, 7 are the primes which divide prior terms but don't divide 18. The least novel multiple of 5 is 20, and the least novel multiple of 7 is 7, therefore a(14) = 7.
