%N A368859 Number of beta-stable isotopes of the n-th element.
%C A368859 A beta-stable nuclide is a nuclide whose beta decay (beta-minus and beta-plus decay) is energetically disallowed; that is to say, a nuclide that has lower energy then its isobars with one more or one less proton. Note that double beta decay is allowed. A nuclide whose beta decay is energetially allowed, even if not observed (in the case of 48Ca, 96Zr, 123Te, 148Gd, 180mTa, 222Rn and 247Cm), is not classified as being beta-stable.
%C A368859 We know 7 beta-stable isotopes of californium (248-252, 254, 256) and fermium (252, 254, 256-260) respectively, but the unobserved nuclides 258Cf and 262Fm could be beta-stable as well.
%C A368859 Different from A179301: for Z <= 83, 5He, 8Be, 146Sm, 150Gd and 154Dy are beta-stable but not primordial. 40K, 48Ca, 50V, 96Zr, 113Cd, 115In, 123Te, 138La, 176Lu, 187Re and 180mTa are primordial but not beta-stable.
%C A368859 Page 12 of the Zagrebaev et al. link predicts that a(113) = 0.
%C A368859 Prediction of a(98)-a(118) from a Russian source: 7, 1, 7, 1, 7, 1, 7, (1, 6 or 2, 5), 1, 4, 1, 7, 1, 7, 1, 7, 1, 7, 1, 7.
%C A368859 Prediction of a(98)-a(125) from pages 14-15 of the Hiroyuki Koura link: 8, 1, 8, 2, 8, 1, 10, 1, 9, 1, 10, 1, 9, 1, 6, 2, 10, 1, 10, 2, 13, 1, 9, 1, 9, 1, 9, 1.

%e A368859 a(2) = 3 because helium-3, -4 and -5 are beta-stable, even if helium-5 has an extremely short half-life.
%e A368859 a(4) = 2 because beryllium-8 and -9 are beta-stable, even if beryllium-8 has an extremely short half-life.
%e A368859 a(62) = 8 because the beta-stable isotopes of samarium are of mass numbers 144, 146-150, 152 and 154, with 146Sm being not primordial.
%e A368859 a(64) = 8 because the beta-stable isotopes of gadolinium are of mass numbers 150, 152, 154-158 and 160, with 150Gd being not primordial.
%e A368859 a(66) = 8 because the beta-stable isotopes of samarium are of mass numbers 154, 156, 158, 160-164, with 154Dy being not primordial.
%e A368859 a(84) = 6 because the beta-stable isotopes of polonium are of mass numbers 210-214 and 216.
