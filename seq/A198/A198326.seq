%N A198326 Sum of lengths of all directed paths in the rooted tree having Matula-Goebel number n.
%C A198326 A directed path of length k in a rooted tree is a sequence of k+1 vertices v[1], v[2], ..., v[k], v[k+1], such that v[j] is a child of v[j-1] for j = 2,3,...,k+1.
%C A198326 The Matula-Goebel number of a rooted tree can be defined in the following recursive manner: to the one-vertex tree there corresponds the number 1; to a tree T with root degree 1 there corresponds the t-th prime number, where t is the Matula-Goebel number of the tree obtained from T by deleting the edge emanating from the root; to a tree T with root degree m>=2 there corresponds the product of the Matula-Goebel numbers of the m branches of T.
%C A198326 a(n)=Sum(k*A198325(n,k), k>=1).

%F A198326 In A198325 we give the recursive construction of the generating polynomials P(n)=P(n,x) of the directed paths of the rooted tree corresponding to the Matula-Goebel number n, with respect to length. a(n) is the derivative dP(n,x)/dx, evaluated at x=1.
%e A198326 a(7)=7 because the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number 7 is the rooted tree Y, having 3 directed paths of length 1 (the edges) and 2 directed paths of length 2.
