%N A198311 Minimum perimeter of n-tuples of Heronian triangles with equal perimeter and equal area.
%C A198311 Kurz's paper reports the first 10 values in a table on page 193, but for some reason the areas are multiplied by 4 (A204559) and the last two values are incorrect since correspond to n-tuples which are not minimal.
%C A198311 If n-tuples were sorted by area instead, a(2) would have been 84, corresponding to triangles (10, 35, 39), (14, 30, 40) with common minimal area 168.
