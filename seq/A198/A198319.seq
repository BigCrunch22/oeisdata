%N A198319 a(n) is the smallest prime(m) such that the interval (prime(m)*n, prime(m+1)*n) contains exactly six primes.
%C A198319 Conjecture. In the supposition that there are infinitely many twin primes, every term beginning with the 12th is 2 or in A001359 (lesser of twin primes).

%F A198319 lim a(n) = infinity, as n goes to infinity.
%e A198319 Let n=19, and consider intervals of the form (19*prime(m), 19*prime(m+1)).  For 2, 3, 5, ..., the intervals (38,57), (57,95), (95,133), (133,209), (209,247), (247,323), (323,361)... contain 4, 8, 8, 14, 7, 13, 6,... primes. Hence the smallest such prime is 17.
