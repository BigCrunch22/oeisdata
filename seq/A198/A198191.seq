%N A198191 Start with sequence 1,2,3, after this a(n) is smallest number > a(n-1) coprime to sum of previous elements.
%C A198191 Starting with sequence 1 and adding increasing numbers coprime to sum of previous elements yields periodic sequence A001651.
%C A198191 By starting with 1,2,3, you get this sequence, apparently non-periodic with sporadic periodic runs of varied length.
%C A198191 Sequence appears to have density of about 0.6 with respect to the positive integers.
%C A198191 Not all primes are in this sequence, 19 being the first missing prime.

%e A198191 1,2,3 are in the sequence by fiat.
%e A198191 The element smaller than 4 are 1,2,3 with sum 6. 4 is not coprime to 6, so 4 is excluded.
%e A198191 The elements smaller than 5 are 1,2,3 with sum 6. 5 is coprime to 6, so 5 is included.
%e A198191 The elements smaller than 6 are 1,2,3,5 with sum 11. 6 is coprime to 11, so 6 is included.
