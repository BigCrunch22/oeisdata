%N A198861 The number of ways to paint the faces of the five Platonic solids using exactly n colors where n is the number of faces of each solid.
%C A198861 Let G, the group of rotations in 3 dimensional space act on the set of n! paintings of each Platonic solid having n faces. There are n! fixed points in the action table since the only element in G that leaves a painting fixed is the identity element. The order of G is A098427/2. So by Burnside's Lemma a(n)=n!/|G|.
