%N A198336 Irregular triangle read by rows: row n is the sequence of Matula-Goebel numbers of the rooted trees obtained from the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number n by pruning it successively 0,1,2,... times. The operation of pruning consists of the removal of the vertices of degree one, together with their incident vertices.
%C A198336 This is the pruning operation mentioned, for example, in the Balaban reference (p. 360) and in the Todeschini - Consonni reference (p. 42).
%C A198336 The Matula-Goebel number of a rooted tree can be defined in the following recursive manner: to the one-vertex tree there corresponds the number 1; to a tree T with root degree 1 there corresponds the t-th prime number, where t is the Matula-Goebel number of the tree obtained from T by deleting the edge emanating from the root; to a tree T with root degree m>=2 there corresponds the product of the Matula-Goebel numbers of the m branches of T.
%C A198336 First entry of row n is n, last entry is 1.
%C A198336 Number of entries in row n is 1 + the radius of the corresponding rooted tree.

%F A198336 A198329(n) is the Matula-Goebel number of the rooted  tree obtained by removing from the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number n the vertices of degree one, together with their incident edges. Repeated application of this yields the Matula-Goebel numbers of the trees obtained by successive prunings. The Maple program is based on this.
%e A198336 Row 7 is 7, 1 because the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number 7 is Y and after the first pruning we obtain the 1-vertex tree having Matula-Goebel number 1. Row 5 is 5, 2, 1 because it refers to the path tree on four vertices; after pruning it becomes the 1-edge tree with Matula-Goebel number 2.
