%N A198210 Frequency of different patterns of permutation's cycles in transitive group PZL(2,16) of order 8160.
%C A198210 These patterns p_n are successive ordered integer partitions of number 17 on sum of integers.
%C A198210 p_1= {1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1},
%C A198210 p_2= {1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2},
%C A198210 p_297={17}
%C A198210 Group PZL(2,16) is Galois group over rationals for some polynomials of 17 degree. Anyone sample isn't know up to now (these is smallest order group with unknown example).
%e A198210 a(1)=1 because group contained only one permutation with pattern a_1={1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1}.
%e A198210 a(7)=68 because in group are 68 different permutations of 17 elements with pattern p_7={1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2}
