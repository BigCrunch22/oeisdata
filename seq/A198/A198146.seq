%N A198146 Primes remaining primes under map 2<=>9 (interchange of decimal digits 2 and 9).
%C A198146 Only primes containing at least one "2" and one "9" are considered.
%C A198146 Inspired by history (told by VIA himself) that most often mistakes made by V. I. Arnold were caused by mixing 2's and 9's (and also 3's and 5's) in the lengthy calculations by hand.
%H A198146 V. I. Arnold, <a href="http://www.mccme.ru/free-books/dubna/via-exp.pdf">Experimental observation of mathematical facts (in Russian)</a>
%e A198146 2293, 9923 both primes; 2393, 9323 both primes.
