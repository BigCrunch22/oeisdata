%N A198047 Primes remaining primes under map 3<=>5 (interchange of decimal digits 3 and 5).
%C A198047 Only primes containing at least one "3" and one "5" are considered.
%C A198047 Inspired by history (told by VIA himself) that most often mistakes made by V. I. Arnold were caused by mixing 3's and 5's (and also 2's and 9's) in the lengthy calculations by hand.
