%N A198791 Least count k that deletes the alternate (odd) numbers in the Josephus problem for a circle of numbers 1, 2, 3, ... 2*n, leaving the even numbers undeleted.
%C A198791 Arrange 1, 2, 3, ... 2*n clockwise in a circle. Starting the count at 1, delete every k-th integer clockwise until exactly half of the numbers have been deleted. a(n) is the least positive integer k for which the deleted numbers are the odd numbers.
%C A198791 Deleting the alternate (even) numbers from a circle of 2*n numbers leaving the odd numbers is trivially achieved with k = 2 for all n >= 1.
