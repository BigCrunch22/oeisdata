%N A198255 Number of ways to write n as the sum of two coprime squarefree semiprimes.
%C A198255 This sequence is term by term less than or equal to A197629.  The first odd term where the inequality is strict is the 97th term.  The first even term that is strictly less than A197629 is the 248th term.
%C A198255 There are interesting bands in the scatterplot of this sequence. - _Antti Karttunen_, Sep 23 2018

%e A198255 Same as A197629 until a(97) since 97=(2)(3)(7)+(5)(11) and thus the value of the 97th term of A197629 is one greater.  The 248th term of A197629 is the first even term which is one greater since 248=(3)(5)(7)+(11)(13).
%e A198255 From _Antti Karttunen_, Sep 23 2018: (Start)
%e A198255 For n = 97 there are following six solutions: 97 = 6+91 = 10+87 = 15+82 = 35+62 = 39+58 = 46+51, thus a(97) = 6.
%e A198255 For n = 248 there are following seven solutions: 248 = 33+215 = 35+213 = 39+209 = 65+183 = 87+161 = 115+133 = 119+129, thus a(248) = 7.
