%N A198195 a(n) is the smallest prime(m) such that the interval (prime(m)*n, prime(m+1)*n) contains exactly five primes.
%C A198195 Conjecture. In the supposition that there are infinitely many twin primes, every term beginning with the 20th is 2 or in A001359 (lesser of twin primes). The sequence is unbounded.

%e A198195 Let n=14, and consider intervals of the form (14*prime(m), 14*prime(m+1)).
%e A198195 For 2, 3, 5, ..., the intervals (28,42), (42,70), (70,98), (98,154), (154,182), (182,238), (238,266)... contain 4, 6, 6, 11, 6, 9, 5,... primes. Hence the smallest such prime is 17.
