%N A198260 Runs of 1s in binary strings corresponding to subgroups of nimber addition.
%C A198260 Counts the runs of consecutive ones in the binary representation of A190939. All positive integers appear in this sequence.
%C A198260 The first A006116(n) entries contain all integers from 1 to 2^(n-1). E.g. the first 67 entries contain all integers from 1 to 8. How often each integer appears is counted by the triangle A227961.
