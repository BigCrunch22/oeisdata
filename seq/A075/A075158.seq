%e A075158 The binary expansion of a(n) begins from the left with as many 1's as is the exponent of the largest prime present in the factorization of n+1 and from then on follows runs of ej+1 zeros and ones alternatively, where ej are the corresponding exponents of the successively lesser primes (0 if that prime does not divide n+1).
