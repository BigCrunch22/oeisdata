%N A075822 Perfect powers ordered with their last two digits (leading zeros omitted).
%C A075822 Perfect powers ordered with their last two digits (leading zeros omitted). The list may be not full and some other two last digits may appear with time.
%C A075822 No values are missing from this list, since values == 2 (mod 4) or == 5, 10, 15, or 20 (mod 25) are unobtainable. It should not be hard to fill in the remaining values from ...59 to ...99. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Feb 14 2013
%e A075822 a(1)=100 because 100 is the smallest perfect power ending with two zeros, 00; a(2)=2401=49^2 because 2401 is the smallest perfect power ending with 01; a(3)=658503=87^3 because 658503 is the smallest perfect power ending with 03.
