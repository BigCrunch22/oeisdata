%N A075611 a(1) = 1, a(n) = smallest number > a(n-1) such that concatenation a(k) a(n) is prime for all k = 1 to n-1. Stop if no such number exists.
%C A075611 The sequence is probably finite.
%e A075611 a(5)=433 since 1433, 3433, 7433 and 73433 are all primes and for every 73<x<433, at least one of 1x, 3x, 7x, 73x is not prime.
