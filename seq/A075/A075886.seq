%N A075886 Number of cubes at generation n when building fractal cube with edge ratio of 1/2.
%C A075886 This sequence gives the number of cubes in each generation "#n" of the fractal cube with edge ratio of 1/2. To create the fractal cube, start with a cube of edge length 1 (the mother cube). Now attach 6 smaller cubes of edge length 1/2 to each free face of the mother cube. Keep edges parallel and place the smaller cubes centrally on each face of the mother cube. These 6 cubes are generation #2.
%C A075886 Next place 30 cubes of edge length 1/4 onto each free face of the 6 generation #2 cubes. Continue to place smaller cubes on each remaining free face. However, the generation #4 cubes touch the mother cube face-to-face such that some of the 5th generation cubes lie totally submerged within the mother cube. In later generations other cubes are submerged within cubes from their previous generations, too. Submerged cubes are not permitted, so these are not included in the totals.
%C A075886 The final displaced volume of the fractal cube (with R = 1/2) as n -> infinity = 2 22/23. If the intersections ARE allowed, the final total volume of all cubes is 3. In addition to the mother cube, there are 5 other types of cubes based on how many larger and smaller cubes are adjacent. The mother cube gives birth to 6 "A" cubes. An "A" cube begets another "A" and 4 "B" cubes. A "B" cube begets an "A", 3 "B" cubes and a "C". A "C" begets 3 "D" cubes and an "E". A "D" begets an "A", 2 "B" cubes and 2 "C" cubes. An "E" cube begets 2 "D" cubes and 2 "E" cubes.
%C A075886 Summing these up, the new number of "A" cubes = A + B + D. New "B" cubes = 4*A + 3*B + 2*D. New "C" cubes = B + 2*D. New "D" cubes = 3*C + 2*E. New "E" cubes = C + 2*E. In the final fractal cube, an "A" cube abuts one larger cube and its children abut no larger cubes. A "B" cube abuts one larger cube and its children abut one larger cube. A "C" cube abuts two larger cubes and its children abut one larger cube. A "D" cube abuts one larger cube and its children abut two larger cubes.
%C A075886 An "E" cube abuts two larger cubes and its children abut two larger cubes. The final fractal cube appears similar to a regular octahedron but apparently exhibits small indentations that differentiate it therefrom.
