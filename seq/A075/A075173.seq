%N A075173 Prime factorization of n encoded by interleaving successive prime exponents in unary to bit-positions given by columns of A075300.
%C A075173 As in A059884, here also we store the exponent e_i of p_i (p1=2, p2=3, p3=5, ...) in the factorization of n to the bit positions given by the column i-1 of A075300 (the exponent of 2 is thus stored to bit positions 0, 2, 4, ..., exponent of 3 to 1, 5, 9, 13, ..., exponent of 5 to 3, 11, 19, 27, 35, ...), but using unary instead of binary system, i.e. we actually store 2^(e_i) - 1 in binary.
%C A075173 This injective mapping from N to N offers an example of the proof given in Cameron's book that any distributive lattice can be represented as a sublattice of the power-set lattice P(X) of some set X. This allows us to implement GCD (A003989) with bitwise AND (A004198) and LCM (A003990) with bitwise OR (A003986). Also, to test whether x divides y, it is enough to check that ((a(x) OR a(y)) XOR a(y)) = A003987(A003986(a(x),a(y)),a(y)) is zero.

%e A075173 a(24) = 23 because 24 = 2^3 * 3^1 so we add the binary words 10101 and 10 to get 10111 in binary = 23 in decimal and a(25) = 2056 because 25 = 5^2 so we form a binary word 100000001000 = 2056 in decimal.
%Y A075173 Variant: A075175. Inverse: A075174. Cf. A059884.
