%N A075483 Number of iteration that first becomes smaller than the initial value if Collatz-function (A006370) is iterated, starting with numbers of form 64n+63.
%C A075483 1stSubmergeLengths[=A074473] with initial values belonging to other residue classes modulo 64 are either listed in A075476-A075483 or can be easily determined. For 64k+2s the first sink below initial value is at 2nd iterate; for 64k+4s+1 the first submerge below initial value comes at 4th term of iteration list; finally if initial value is of 64k+4s+3 form or moreover initial value = 64k+r, r = 3, 11, 19, 23, 35, 43, 51, 55, then for all k first sink emerges at the 7th, 9th, 7th, 9th, 7th, 9th, 7th, 9th iterates, respectively.
%F A075483 a(n) = A074473(64n + 63).
%e A075483 n=8: 64n + 63 = 575, the list = the 17th term 410 < 575 = initial value, so a(8)=17.
