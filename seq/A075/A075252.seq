%N A075252 Trajectory of n under the Reverse and Add! operation carried out in base 2 does not reach a palindrome and (presumably) does not join the trajectory of any term m < n.
%C A075252 Base-2 analog of A063048 (base 10) and A075421 (base 4); subsequence of A066059. - For the trajectory of 22 (cf. A061561) and the trajectory of 77 (cf. A075253) it has been proved that they do not contain a palindrome. A similar proof can be given for most terms of this sequence, but there are a few terms (4262, 17498, 33378, 33898, ...) whose trajectory does not show the kind of regularity that can be utilized for the construction of a proof. - If the trajectory of an integer k joins the trajectory of a smaller integer which is a term of the present sequence, then this occurs after very few 'Reverse and Add!' steps (at most 84 for numbers < 20000). On the other hand, the trajectories of the terms of this sequence do not join the trajectory of any smaller term within at least 1000 steps.

%C A075252 Most terms in this sequence eventually give rise to a regular binary pattern. These regular patterns can be represented by contextfree grammars:
%C A075252 S_a -> 10 T_a 00, T_a -> 1 T_a 0 | A_a(n);
%C A075252 S_b -> 11 T_b 01, T_b -> 0 T_b 1 | B_a(n);
%C A075252 S_c -> 10 T_c 000, T_c -> 1 T_c 0 | C_a(n) and
%C A075252 S_d -> 11 T_d 101, T_d -> 0 T_d 1 | D_a(n).
%C A075252 A_22 = 1101, B_22 = 1000, C_22 = 1101, D_22 = 0010 (see also A058042);
