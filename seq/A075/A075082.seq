%N A075082 Numbers n such that n! is a product of distinct factorials k!*l!*m!*... with k, l, m, etc. < n.
%C A075082 r! is a member for r>2, since (r!)! = (r!)*(r!-1)!.
%C A075082 Subsequence of A034878 (all n such that n! is a product of smaller factorials). It is conjectured that A034878 and A001013 (Jordan-Polya numbers = products of factorials) are the same sequence (except for the numbers 2, 9 and 10). If this is true, then obviously A075082 (without the number 10) is also a subsequence of A001013. On the other hand, this special case of the conjecture might be easier to prove. (a(n)!)^2 is a member of A058295 (products of distinct factorials); for example, (6!)^2 = 6!*5!*3!. - _Jonathan Sondow_, Dec 21 2004
%C A075082 May be the same as A058295 except for 2, 10 and 16. - _Jud McCranie_, Jun 13 2005
%C A075082 By using similar logic, r!s!t! is a member for at least two, all distinct r,s,t,... > 1. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Jan 27 2006
%C A075082 Except for 1, 10 & 16, all the members are of the form immediately above. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Jan 27 2006
%C A075082 Except for 10 and 16, all members, n, have as the greatest factorial in is product representation of n, n-1. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Jan 27 2006
%C A075082 Theorem, for n to be a member of A075082, then the largest distinct factorial, m!, less than n! must not be less than the greatest prime less than n. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Jan 27 2006
