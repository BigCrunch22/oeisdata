%N A075821 List of possible last two digits (leading zeros omitted) of perfect powers.
%C A075821 An equivalent definition: Numbers equal to the final two digits of their 21st, 41st, 61st, etc. powers. - _Henry Bottomley_, Nov 25 2004
%F A075821 Consists of all numbers below 100 except those which are a multiple of 2 but not 4 and those which are a multiple of 5 but not 25. - _Henry Bottomley_, Nov 25 2004
%e A075821 With leading zeros, the initial terms are 00, 01, 03, 04, 07, 08, 09. Corresponding smallest perfect powers are 100, 2401, 658503, 2304, 16807, 140608, 2209.
%e A075821 1 (01!) is OK because the perfect power 2401=49^2 ends with 01. 9 (09!) is OK because the perfect power 2209=47^2 ends with 09.
%e A075821 11 is in the sequence since 11^21=7400249944258160101211 and the final two digits are 11.
