%N A075557 a(n) is the smallest odd prime such that (1) a(n) doesn't already appear in the sequence; (2) the n-th partial sum is divisible by n; and (3) the n-th partial sum is relatively prime to n+1.
%C A075557 Condition (3) is needed to ensure that a(n+1) exists.
%e A075557 a(5)=37: The 4th partial sum is 28. 7 is the smallest odd prime that satisfies (2) (28+7=35), but 7 has already been used. 17 satisfies (1) and (2) (28+17=45), but 45+a(6) must be a multiple of 6 and the only odd prime satisfying that requirement is 3, which has already been used. 37 works (28+37=65).
