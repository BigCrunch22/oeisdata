%N A075631 Group the natural numbers so that the n-th group contains smallest set of consecutive numbers whose sum is a multiple of the sum for the previous group: (1), (2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18), (19, 20, ... Sequence gives sums of terms of the groups.
%C A075631 Let n be the last term of a group with sum s. The end of the next group is computed by solving x^2 + x - n*(n+1) == 0 (mod 2*s) and picking the smallest solution x > n. For example to find the term after 12 (the (3,4,5) group), solve x^2 + x - 5*6 == 0 (mod 2*12). The solutions are x = {2, 5, 18, 24}; the end of the next group must be 18 and so the next term is Sum_{i=6..18} i = 156. - Jonathan Cross (jcross(AT)juggler.net), May 08 2004
