%N A075468 Minimal m such that n^n-m and n^n+m are both primes, or -1 if there is no such m.
%C A075468 n^n is an interprime, the average of two consecutive primes, presumably only for n = 2, 6 and 9. In general n^n may be average of several pairs of primes, in which case the minimal distance is in the sequence. It is not clear (but quite probable) that for all n, n^n is the average of two primes. See also n! and n!! as average of two primes in A075409 and A075410.
%F A075468 n^n -/+ a(n) are both primes, with a(n) being the smallest common distance.
%e A075468 a(4)=15 because 4^4=256 and 256 -/+ 15 = 271 and 241 are primes with smallest distance from 4^4; a(23)= 10800 because 23^23 = 20880467999847912034355032910567 and 23^23 -/+ 10800 are two primes with the smallest distance from 23^23.
