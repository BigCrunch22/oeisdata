%N A075100 Number of terms of length < n that are needed on the way to computing all words of length n in the free monoid with two generators.
%C A075100 I believe a(2n) = a(n)+ 2^n. I think a(7) = 28.
%C A075100 _Benoit Jubin_ (Jan 24 2009) suggests replacing "monoid" in the definition by "semigroup".
%C A075100 Shouldn't a(2) = 2 ? Shouldn't a(3) = 5, because we need x, y, xx, xy, yy ? I'm confused! - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 25 2006. Comment from _Benoit Jubin_, Jan 24 2009: I think the confusion comes from the fact that _N. J. A. Sloane_ counts the one-letter words, so obtains always the written value plus 2. I think N. J. A. Sloane's way of counting is preferable, so the terms should be changed accordingly.
%e A075100 a(3) = 3 because we need only xx, xy, yy to generate each of xxx, xxy, xyx, yxx, xyy, yxy, yyx, yyy.
%Y A075100 Cf. A075099, A003313, A124677.
