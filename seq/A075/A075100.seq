%N A075100 Number of words of length strictly between 1 and n that are needed on the way to computing all words of length n in the free monoid with two generators.
%C A075100 I believe a(2n) = a(n) + 2^n. I think a(7) = 28.
%C A075100 _Benoit Jubin_ (Jan 24 2009) suggests replacing "monoid" in the definition by "semigroup" and remarks that it makes sense to introduce a new sequence that includes words of length 1 in the count.
%e A075100 a(3) = 3 because we need only xx, xy, yy to generate each of xxx, xxy, xyx, yxx, xyy, yxy, yyx, yyy.
%Y A075100 Cf. A075099, A003313, A124677.
