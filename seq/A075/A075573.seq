%N A075573 a(1)=1; a(n) is the smallest positive number not occurring earlier, with different parity from a(n-1), such that sum of any subsequence of two or more consecutive terms is composite.
%C A075573 The sequence is infinite. To extend it from the first N terms, one seeks a constellation of composite numbers, of the right parity, whose span is no greater than the sum of the first N terms, S(N). There are infinitely many sequences, of consecutive composite numbers, of length S(N)+1 (indeed, any particular length); and each of those contains a sequence of length S(N) with the right parity. One of those must suffice and that puts an upper-bound on the N+1'st term. - _Don Reble_, Oct 02 2002
