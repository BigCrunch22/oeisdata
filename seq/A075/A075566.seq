%N A075566 Rearrangement of natural numbers by choosing alternately even and odd numbers such that every partial sum a(1)+...+a(n) is composite.
%e A075566 The first number must be composite, so a(1) = 4; next number must be odd and a(2) = 1 or 3 would make a(1)+a(2) prime, so a(2) = 5; etc.
%Y A075566 Cf. A075567.
