%N A116660 Integers in both sequences A075658 and A067028.
%C A116660 It could be argued that 1 should also be included in the sequence, if 0 is considered to be a composite, since the number of prime divisors (counted with multiplicity) of 1 and the sum of 1's distinct prime divisors are both 0.

%e A116660 60 = 2^2 *3^1 *5^1. Both the number of prime divisors (counted with multiplicity), 2+1+1 = 4 and the sum of the distinct prime divisors, 2+3+5 = 10, are composite. So 60 is in the sequence.
