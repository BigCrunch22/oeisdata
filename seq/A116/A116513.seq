%N A116513 Number of distinct hexagons of n points chosen from triangular lattice A_2 with sides parallel to the principal axes of that lattice. Degenerate sides (of length 1) are permitted.
%C A116513 This sequence is to the lattice A2 as sequence A038548 is to the lattice D2; presumably other lattices have analogous sequences.
%C A116513 a(n) is also the number of 4-tuples (p,b,c,d) of nonnegative integers satisfying b <= c <= d, b + c + d < p, and n = t(p) - t(b) - t(c) - t(d) where t(x) is the x-th triangular number (A000217).
