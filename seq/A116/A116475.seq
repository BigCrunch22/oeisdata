%N A116475 Equal divisions of the octave with progressively increasing consistency limits and distinct approximations for all the ratios in the tonality diamond of that limit.
%C A116475 Since the 1-division is distinct and consistent in the 1-limit, the sequence starts there. From a purely musical point of view one might prefer to begin the sequence at 3. - _Gene Ward Smith_, Mar 29 2006
%e A116475 9-EDO is consistent and distinct through the 5 limit because 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 8/5 and 5/3 map to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 steps respectively and all the compositions of those intervals are consistent.
%Y A116475 Cf. A116474, A117577, A117578.
