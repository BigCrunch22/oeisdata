%N A116369 Day of the week corresponding to Jan 01 of a given year (n=0 for the year 2000).
%C A116369 The number of days in the 400 year cycle of the Gregorian calendar is 365 * 400 + 100 (leap year every 4 years) - 4 (no leap year in centuries) + 1 (leap year every 400 years) = 146097 days. Since 146097 is (coincidentally) divisible by 7 (7 * 20871), the cycle repeats exactly every 400 years. As a consequence, the probability of Jan 01 of a given year being any given weekday is not 1/7. Sunday, Tuesday and Friday have the highest probability (14.50%); Wednesday and Thursday 14.25%; Monday and Saturday 14.00%.
