%N A116912 In prime factorization of n replace all primes of form k*6+1 with k*6+5 and primes of form k*6+5 with k*6+1.
%C A116912 Primes of form 6n + 1 are also primes of the form 3n+1 and -3 is a quadratic residue mod a prime p iff p is in this sequence. Primes of the form 6n + 5 are the same as A003627 Primes of form 3n-1, except that the latter sequence starts with 2. Every twin prime after (3,5) is of the form (6n+5, 6n+1) hence the current sequence exchanges lesser twin primes with greater twin primes. See also: A072010 In prime factorization of n replace all primes of form k*4+1 by k*4+3 and primes of form k*4+3 by k*4+1. See also: A002476 Primes of form 6n + 1.

%e A116912 a(5) = 1 because 5 is a prime of the form 6n + 5 (with n = 0), so is replaced with 6n + 1 (with n = 0), namely 1.
%e A116912 a(7) = 11 because 7 is a prime of the form 6n + 1 (with n = 1), so is replaced with 6n + 5 (with n = 1), namely 11.
%e A116912 a(11) = 7 because 11 is a prime of the form 6n + 5 (with n = 1), so is replaced with 6n + 1 (with n = 1), namely 7.
%e A116912 a(13) = 17 because 13 is a prime of the form 6n + 1 (with n = 2), so is replaced with 6n + 5 (with n = 2), namely 17.
%e A116912 a(14) = 22 because 14 = 2 * 7; but 7 is a prime of the form 6n + 1 (with n = 1), so is replaced with 6n + 5 (with n = 1), namely 11; giving 2 * 11 = 22.
