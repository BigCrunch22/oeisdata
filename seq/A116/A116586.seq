%N A116586 The symbol numbers of the IChing in rectangular/ square array taken as an antidiagonal.
%C A116586 Traditional Chinese question answering symbols usually taken in a random order of drawing. The IChing is a Pascal Polynomial base: (x+1)^6 1,6,15,20,6,1 Two symbols taken six at a time to 64 total symbols. It is part of the famous "Eight Fold Way" in Chinese mysticism. The draw is eight at random and use the symbols they "mean" to interpret a "question". It sort of like a "yes" or "no" using a coin toss only with a book to interpret the results. Questions have to be formulated in a specific format. Think of each IChing symbol as the result of six coin tosses. So taking 8 symbols is like 48 =8*6 coin tosses in a row.
