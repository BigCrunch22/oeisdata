%N A116538 a(1)=1, a(2)=2; a(n) is the smallest positive integer not occurring earlier in the sequence such that gcd(a(n-2), a(n-1)+a(n)) = 1.
%C A116538 Sequence may be a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A116538 Among the positive integers not occurring among the first 6 terms of the sequence, 8 is the smallest m such that gcd(a(5), a(6)+m) = gcd(6,5+m) = 1.
%e A116538 Had we used 7 for m instead, we would have had gcd(6,5+7) = 6. So a(7) = 8.
