%N A116865 Characteristic array for partitions with only prime parts.
%C A116865 The row length sequence of this array is p(n)=A000041(n) (number of partitions).
%C A116865 The partitions of n are ordered according to Abramowitz-Stegun (A-St), pp. 831-2.

%F A116865 a(n,k)= 1 if the k-th partition of n, in the Abramowitz-Stegun order, has only prime parts, else 0. See A000040 for the prime numbers.

%e A116865 a(4,3)=1 because the third partition of 4 is, in A-St order, (2,2)
%e A116865 which has only prime numbers as parts. Each of the other four partitions of 4
%e A116865 has at least one part which is not a prime number.
%Y A116865 See also array A116864.
%Y A116865 Row sums give A000607(n), n>=1.
