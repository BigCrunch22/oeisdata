%N A116020 Numbers n such that sigma(n) - phi(n) is a repdigit greater than 2.
%C A116020 For every prime p sigma(p)-phi(p) is 2, so that case is trivial.
%C A116020 (I). If both numbers p=4*10^n+1 & q=(4*10^n-13)/9 are primes then m=p*q is in the sequence because sigma(m)-phi(m)=8*(10^(n+1)-1)/9 is a repdigit number. Conjecture: 123, 17243 & 1772443 are all such terms. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Aug 24 2006
%C A116020 (II). If p=(10^n-7)/3 is prime then m=2p is in the sequence because sigma(m)-phi(m)=2p+4=6*(10^n-1)/9 is a repdigit number. 62 is the smallest such terms. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Aug 24 2006
%C A116020 (III). If p=(4*10^n-31)/9 is prime then m=3p is in the sequence because sigma(m)-phi(m)=2p+6=8*(10^n-1)/9 is a repdigit number. 123 is the smallest such terms. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Aug 24 2006
%C A116020 (IV). If p=(8*10^n-17)/9 is a prime then both numbers 4p & 46p are in the sequence because sigma(4p)-phi(4p)=5p+9=4*(10^(n+1)-1)/9 & sigma(46p)-phi(46p)=50p+94=4*(10^(n+2)-1)/9 are repdigit numbers. 28 & 322 are the smallest such terms. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Aug 24 2006
%C A116020 (V). If p=(4*10^n-13)/9 is a prime greater than 3 then m=6p is in the sequence because sigma(m)-phi(m)=10p+14=4*(10^(n+1)-1)/9 is a repdigit number. 258 is the smallest such terms. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Aug 24 2006
%C A116020 (VI). If p=(8*10^(2n+1)-179)/99 is prime then m=8p is in the sequence because sigma(m)-phi(m)=11p+19=8*(10^(2n+1)-1)/9 is a repdigit number. 632 is the smallest such terms. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Aug 24 2006
%C A116020 (VII). If p=(10^(3n+1)-37)/27 is prime then m=12p is in the sequence because sigma(m)-phi(m)=24p+32=8*(10^(3n+1)-1)/9 is a repdigit number. 4444444428 is the smallest such terms. - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Aug 24 2006
%e A116020 sigma(662) - phi(662) = 666.
