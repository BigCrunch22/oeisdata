%N A116594 a^n*b^m ordering of IChing symbol numbers.
%C A116594 Traditional Chinese question answering symbols usually taken in a random order of drawing. The IChing is a Pascal Polynomial base: (x+1)6 1,6,15,20,6,1 Two symbols taken six at a time to 64 total symbols. It is part of the famous "Eight Fold Way" in Chinese mysticism. The draw is eight at random and use the symbols they "mean" to interpret a "question". It sort of like a "yes" or "no" using a coin toss only with a book to interpret the results. Questions have to be formulated in a specific format. Think of each IChing symbol as the result of six coin tosses. So taking 8 symbols is like 48 =8*6 coin tosses in a row. It will noticed in this ordering by binomial types that there is a pattern of pairing of symbols by number.
