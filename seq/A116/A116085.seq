%N A116085 First differences of A116084.
%C A116085 a(n-1) is the number of ways 1 can be written as sum of distinct positive fractions less than 1, having no denominator larger than n, and at least one equal to n (in its reduced form). (This follows from the definition of this sequence as first differences of A116084 or A154888, but these sequences are typically computed as partial sums of this one and could therefore be considered as less fundamental.) - _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 14 2016
%F A116085 a(n) = A116084(n+1) - A116084(n).
%F A116085 a(p-1) = A000009(p) - 1 for prime p.
%e A116085 a(1) = 0 since there is no way to write 1 as sum of distinct fractions with denominator not larger than 2.
%e A116085 a(2) = # [1/3+2/3] = 1,
%e A116085 a(3) = # [1/4+3/4] = 1,
