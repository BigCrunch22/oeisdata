%N A116857 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of partitions of n into distinct odd parts, the largest of which is k (n>=1, k>=1).
%C A116857 Both rows 2n-1 and 2n have 2n-1 terms each. Row sums yield A000700. T(n,2k)=0 Sum(k*T(n,k),k>=1) = A092316(n).

%e A116857 T(20,11)=2 because we have [11,9] and [11,5,3,1].
%e A116857 T(30,17)=3 because we have [17,13],[17,9,3,1] and [17,7,5,1].
