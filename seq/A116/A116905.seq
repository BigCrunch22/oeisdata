%N A116905 Number of partitions of n-th 3-almost prime into 2 squares.
%C A116905 See also A000161 Number of partitions of n into 2 squares (when order does not matter and zero is allowed).
%F A116905 a(n) = A000161(A014612(n)).
%e A116905 a(1) = 1 because A014612(1) = 8 = 2^2 + 2^2, the unique sum of squares.
%e A116905 a(2) = 0 because A014612(2) = 12 has no decomposition into sum of 2 squares because it has a prime factor p == 3 (mod 4) with an odd power.
%e A116905 a(11) = 2 because A014612(11) = 50 = 2*5^2 = 1^2 + 7^2 = 5^2 + 5^2.
%e A116905 a(30) = 2 because A014612(30) = 125 = 5^3 = 2^2 + 11^2 = 5^2 + 1^0.
%e A116905 a(31) = 2 because A014612(31) = 130 = 2*5*13 = 3^2 + 11^2 = 7^2 + 9^2.
%e A116905 a(39) = 2 because A014612(39) = 170 = 2*5*17 = 1^2 + 13^2 = 7^2 + 11^2.
