%N A116992 Number of primes < (highest prime dividing any composite between the n-th and (n+1)th prime) that are coprime to every composite between the n-th and (n+1)th prime.

%e A116992 Between the 12th prime and the 13th prime are the composites 38, 39 and 40.
%e A116992 Dividing these composites are the primes 2, 3, 5, 13 and 19. There are three primes < 19 and coprime to the composites between 37 and 41: 7, 11 and 17. So a(12) = 3.
