%N A116863 Array used to find the eigenvalues of the quadratic Casimir operator for the Lie algebras A_n = su(n+1), n>=1.
%C A116863 Irreducible representations of the rank n Lie algebra A_n (also called su(n+1)) are determined by their Dynkin labels (indices) [a[1],..,a[n]] which are nonnegative numbers. The quadratic Casimir operator C2_n for A_n is given (up to normalization) by an integer polynomial of degree 2 in these n labels.
%C A116863 The first n*(n+1)/2= A000217(n) numbers in row n give the coefficients of the quadratic terms according to the index ordering: 11,12,13,...,1n;22,23,...,2n;33,...,3n;...;nn. The last n numbers in row n give the linear terms according to the ordering: 1,2,...,n.
%C A116863 The numbers in the even numbered rows are divisible by 2.
%C A116863 The determinant of the Cartan matrix for the Lie algebra A_n is n+1. The factor 1/(n+1) from the inverse Cartan matrix has been taken out in the formula given below.
%C A116863 For the n X n Cartan matrix C(n) for the Lie algebra A_n see, e.g., the Slansky reference p. 81, table 6 (called A(A_n) there) and p. 82, table7, where the inverse Cartan matrix is given (called there G(A_n)).
%C A116863 The formula used to compute the C2_n polynomials can be found, e.g., in the van Ritbergen et al. reference, eq. (27).
%C A116863 The author thanks Stephan Rachel and Ronny Thomale for drawing his attention to this exercise.
%C A116863 The C2_n polynomial for A_n has n*(n+3)/2=A000096(n) terms: n*(n+1)/2= A000217(n) quadratic terms and n linear terms.
%C A116863 The sequence of row lengths is n*(n+3)/2=A000096(n)=[2,5,9,14,20,27,35,44,54,65,...], n>=1.
%C A116863 The row sums are conjectured to be 3*A002415(n+1)= [3, 18, 60, 150, 315, 588, 1008, 1620, 2475, 3630,...]

%F A116863 The polynomials are C2_n:= (rowvec(n,2+a)*C^{(-1)}(n)*colvec(n,a))*(n+1), with C^{(-1)}(n) the inverse of the n X n Cartan matrix C(n) for A_n. Here colvec(n,a) is the transposed of [a[1],a[2],...,a[n]] and rowvec(n,2+a):=[2+a[1],2+a[2],...,2+a[n]].
