%N A116889 a(n) is the least prime p that remains prime through n iterations of function f(p)=p^2+4.
%C A116889 The sequence is finite, since it can be proved that if p, f(p), f(f(p)), f(f(f(p))) and f(f(f(f(p)))) are all primes, then the next iteration gives a multiple of 13, greater than 13, thus a(k) for k>=5 does not exist.
%e A116889 a(0)=2 since f(2)=8 is not prime. a(1)=a(2)=3 since both f(3)=13 and f(f(3))=173 are primes.
