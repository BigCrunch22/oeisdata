%N A116516 Decimal expansion of constant C such that floor(p# * C) is always a prime number (for p >= 2), where p# is the primorial function, i.e., the product of prime numbers up to and including p.
%C A116516 This constant is similar to Mills's constant (where floor(x^(3^n)) is always prime). I've calculated it all by myself and I never heard of it before. I can't even prove that it exists, but after my calculations, it is most likely. It definitely starts with these 43 decimal digits. Does anybody know if anyone calculated this before?
%C A116516 There should be infinitely many constants such that floor(p# * C) is always prime, but the range in which these numbers appear is extremely narrow and every such constant would start with these 74 decimal digits.

%e A116516 If the constant 1.2541961... is continuously multiplied by the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 ..., then floor(x) is always prime (i.e., 2, 7, 37, 263, 2897, ...).
