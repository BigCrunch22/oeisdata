%N A324257 Conceited Numbers: Composite numbers that are a concatenation of their distinct prime factors with multiplicity in some order allowing overlap.
%C A324257 "Conceited Numbers" (they are full of themselves).
%C A324257 The decimal representation of these numbers can be formed typographically from their prime factors. Every distinct prime factor must appear at least once. Generalization of the sequence A083359.
%C A324257 Subsequences:
%C A324257 --No overlap: A324258
%C A324257 --Every prime factor appears in number (not just distinct prime factors): A324259
%C A324257 --No multiplicity: A324260
%C A324257 --Multiplicity only up to the exponent of the distinct prime factor: A083359
%C A324257 Other subsequences are formed by more than one constraint; e.g., A121342 is the intersection of A324258 and A324260, terms with no overlap and no multiplicity.

%e A324257 67335 = 3*5*67^2 formed by 67||3|||3||5 (this term is not in A083359 because two 3's are required in the concatenation).
%e A324257 3719193 = 3*19*71*919 formed by 3||71||9(19)||3 where 19 and 919 overlap.
