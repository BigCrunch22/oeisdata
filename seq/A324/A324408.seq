%N A324408 Number of chiral pairs of polyomino rings of length 4n with fourfold rotational symmetry.
%C A324408 Redelmeier uses these rings to enumerate polyominoes of the regular tiling {4,4} with fourfold rotational symmetry (A144553) and an even number of cells. Each cell of a polyomino ring is adjacent to (shares an edge with) exactly two other cells. Each chiral ring is congruent to but different from its reflection; the two form a chiral pair.
%C A324408 These chiral rings have fourfold symmetry.
%C A324408 For n odd, the center of the ring is a vertex of the tiling; for n even, the center is the center of a tile.
%C A324408 In early September, 2021, _John Mason_ informed me that a(16) should be 6696 instead of 6695. He supplied me with representations of all of the rings, and I slowly discovered that my program had missed one and had serious errors. After I corrected it, we did match new values for a(16), a(18), a(20), and a(22). We are reasonably confident that the values shown are now correct. - _Robert A. Russell_, Sep 30 2021
