%N A324149 Least integer x such that every set of the length-n subwords of some binary word y is achievable by taking the subwords of some word of length <= x.
%C A324149 Another way to say this is that a(n) is the least integer x such that every subset of vertices encountered by some walk on the de Bruijn graph of order n is achievable by a walk of length <= x-n (length = number of edges).
%C A324149 The original definition was: "Maximal length of the shortest non-circular witness over all representable sets of binary vectors of length n.".

%e A324149 For n = 1,2,3,4 examples of a longest word (whose set of length-n subwords did not appear as the subwords of any shorter word) are 01, 00110, 0001011100, 000010010101100101101111.
