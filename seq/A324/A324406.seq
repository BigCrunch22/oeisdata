%N A324406 Number of oriented polyomino rings of length 4n with fourfold rotational symmetry.
%C A324406 Redelmeier uses these rings to enumerate polyominoes of the regular tiling {4,4} with fourfold rotational symmetry (A144553) and an even number of cells. Each cell of a polyomino ring is adjacent to (shares an edge with) exactly two other cells. For oriented rings, chiral pairs (though congruent) are counted as two.
%C A324406 For n odd, the center of the ring is a vertex of the tiling; for n even, the center is the center of a tile.
%C A324406 Corrected; see A324408. - _Robert A. Russell_, Sep 30 2021

%F A324406 a(n) = A324407(n) + A324408(n) = 2*A324407(n) - A324409(n) = 2*A324408(n) + A324409(n).
%e A324406 For a(1)=1, the four cells form a square. For a(2)=1, the eight cells form a 3 X 3 square with the center cell omitted. For a(3)=1, the twelve cells form a 4 X 4 square with the four inner cells omitted. For a(4)=2, the sixteen cells of one ring form a 5 X 5 square with the nine inner cells omitted; the other ring is similar, but with each corner cell omitted and replaced with the cell diagonally toward the center from that corner cell.
