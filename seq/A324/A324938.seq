%N A324938 a(n) = the number of values of m such that the sum of proper unitary divisors of m (A034460) is n.
%C A324938 The unitary version of A048138.
%C A324938 The offset is 2 as in A048138 since there are infinitely many numbers (all the powers of primes) for which A034460 = 1.

%F A324938 a(A063948(n)) = 0.
%e A324938 a(8) = 2 since 8 is the sum of the proper unitary divisors of 10 (1 + 2 + 5) and 12 (1 + 3 + 4).
