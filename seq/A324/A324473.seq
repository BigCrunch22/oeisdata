%N A324473 k appears A278045(k)+1 times.
%C A324473 Each k appears one more times than the number of trailing zeros in the tribonacci representation of n (see A278038).
%C A324473 This is related to the tribonacci representation of n in the same way as A046699 (without its initial term) is related to the binary representation of n and as A316628 is to the Zeckendorf representation of n.
