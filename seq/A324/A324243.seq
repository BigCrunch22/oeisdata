%N A324243 Rotkiewicz numbers: numbers k such that a^sigma(k) == b^sigma(k) (mod k) for all pairs of numbers a, b such that gcd(a*b, k) = 1, where sigma(k) is the sum of divisors of k (A000203).
%C A324243 Rotkiewicz defined these numbers and found the first 6 terms that are semiprimes (6, 14, 15, 35, 65, 119, and 377).
%C A324243 Křížek et al. named these numbers Rotkiewicz numbers, and proved that the following criteria are equivalent to the definition:
%C A324243 1) Numbers k such that c^sigma(k) == 1 (mod k) for all numbers c such that gcd(c, k) = 1.
%C A324243 2) Numbers k such that lambda(k) | sigma(k) where lambda is the Carmichael lambda function (A002322).
%C A324243 They also proved that:
%C A324243 1) If M(p) = 2^p-1 is a Mersenne prime (A000668) then 2^(p-2)*M(p) is a term.
%C A324243 2) If n is a term and, 2^k is the largest power of 2 that divides sigma(n), and F(m) = 2^(2^m) + 1 is a Fermat prime not dividing n such that m <= log_2(k+1) then n*F(m) is also a term.
