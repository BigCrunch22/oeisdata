%N A324211 Numbers k such that the sum of the binary digits of the exponents of the prime factorization of k is odd and k is a product of primorials.
%C A324211 This sequence is a primitive sequence of A000028; it lists minimal terms in that sequence having their prime exponents.
%e A324211 180 is a term as 180 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 which has exponents in binary 10_2, 10_2 and 1_2 respectively. The sum of binary digits of those exponents is (1 + 0) + (1 + 0) + 1 = 3 which is odd. Furthermore, 180 is a product of primorials; 180 = 30 * 6. Therefore, 180 is in the sequence.
