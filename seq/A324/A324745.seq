%N A324745 Numbers k with exactly two distinct prime factors and such that phi(k) is a square.
%C A324745 This sequence is the intersection of A007774 and A039770.
%C A324745 The sequences A324746 and A324747 form a partition of this sequence.
%C A324745 See the file "Subfamilies and subsequences" (& II) in A039770 for more details, proofs with data, comments, formulas and examples.
%C A324745 The integers with only one prime factor and whose totient is a square are in A054755.
%F A324745 1st family (A324746): The primitive terms are defined by p*q, p < q, with phi(p*q) = (p-1)*(q-1) = m^2. The general terms are defined by k = p^(2s+1) * q^(2t+1), s,t >= 0, with phi(k) = (p^s * q^t * m)^2.
%F A324745 2nd family (A324747): The primitive terms are defined by p^2 * q, p <> q, with phi(p^2 * q) = p*(p-1)*(q-1) = m^2. The general terms are defined by k = p^(2s ) * q^(2t+1), s >= 1, t >= 0, with phi(k) = (p^(s-1) * q^t * m)^2.
%e A324745 1st family: 136 = 2^3 * 37 and phi(136) = 8^2.
%e A324745 2nd family: 652 = 2^2 * 163 and phi(652) = 18^2.
