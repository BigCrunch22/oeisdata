%N A324274 a(n) is the number of squares visited by a single pawn move for an even square and a double pawn move for an odd square on a diagonally numbered board and moving to the lowest available unvisited square of different parity at each step from subsequent starting squares n; or a(n) = 0 for an infinite length.
%C A324274 It is conjectured that all starting squares will either have a finite length or reach the top row of the board at square 2 first and then follow the sequence for a(2) to infinity. A324275 contains numbers n for which A324274(n) = 0.
%e A324274 a(1) is the length of A324273. a(2) has an infinite length as it will follow a repeating pattern along the top row of the numbered board.
