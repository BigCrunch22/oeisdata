%N A324145 Minimal length of a string over the alphabet A = {1,2,...,n} that contains every derangement of A as a substring exactly once.
%C A324145 Such strings could be called superderangements (compare A180632).
%C A324145 From _Rob Pratt_, Feb 22 2019: (Start)
%C A324145 I used the TSP (Traveling Salesman) solver in SAS, which discovered the values reported for n = 4 through 7 and proved that they are optimal.
%C A324145 For n = 2 and 3, the optimal solution is unique.
%C A324145 For n = 4, there are exactly four optimal solutions:
%C A324145 4321431241314234123421
%C A324145 4312413142341234214321
%C A324145 4312341231424134214321
%C A324145 4321431234123142413421

%e A324145 Examples of minimal superderangements for 2,3,4 symbols:
%e A324145 For n = 2: 21, length 2.
%e A324145 For n = 3: 2312, length = 4 (For n=3 there are just two derangements, 231 and 312, so 2312 is clearly optimal.)
%e A324145 For n = 4: 4312413142341234214321, length = 22 (optimality established by _Rob Pratt_, Feb 21 2019).
%e A324145 For examples for n = 5, 6, and 7 that were discovered and proved optimal by _Rob Pratt_ using SAS, see the link.
%e A324145 Strings for n = 4,5,6,7 were earlier found by _Sigurd Kittilsen_ and _Lars Tveito_, although they did not prove they were optimal.
