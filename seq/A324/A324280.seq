%N A324280 Lexicographically earliest sequence of different terms starting with a(1) = 2 such that the n-th digit of the sequence, placed in front of a(n) and then concatenated, produces a composite number.
%C A324280 No digit 0 is admitted in a(n) in order to avoid leading zeroes after the concatenation.
