%N A324480 Consider the numbers on the x-axis in the spiral shown in A274641; a(n) is the distance from n to the origin, or -1 if n never appears on the x-axis.
%C A324480 It is conjectured that every nonnegative number appears on the x-axis exactly once.
%C A324480 a(n) is also the distance to the origin from the point n+1 on the x-axis in A274640.

%e A324480 The portion of the x-axis near 0 is:
%e A324480 ... 14   6   5   4   2   0   1   3   7  10  11 ...
%e A324480 and we see that both 1 and 2 are at distance 1 from 0. So a(1) = a(2) = 1.
