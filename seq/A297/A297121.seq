%N A297121 Self-describing sequence: sequence starts with a(1) = 2 and a(n) is chosen to be the smallest positive number not already in the sequence such that the assertion "sequence gives the positions of the even digits when the sequence is read as a string of digits" is true.
%C A297121 Inspired by Sloane's sequence A125132.
%H A297121 Jean-Marc Falcoz, <a href="/A297121/b297121.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..2001</a>
%e A297121 Here are the digits strung together (the even digits occur at positions that are indexed by terms of the sequence):
%e A297121 -241678201
%e A297121 0121416182
%e A297121 2242628303
%e A297121 2343638404...
%e A297121 Explanation: a(2) must be even, so a(2)=4; a(3)=1; a(4) must be even, so a(4)=6; a(5) cannot be 3 or 5 (contradiction) thus a(5)=7. And so on.
