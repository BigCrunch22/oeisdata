%N A297673 Triangular array T(n, k) read by rows, n > 0, 0 < k <= n: T(n, k) = least unused positive value (reading rows from left to right) such that T(n, k) + T(n+1, k) + T(n+1, k+1) is prime.
%C A297673 See A296305 for the corresponding sums.
%C A297673 Each term may be involved in up to three sums:
%C A297673 - T(1, 1) is involved in one sum,
%C A297673 - For any n > 1, T(n, 1) and T(n, k) are involved in two sums:
%C A297673 - For any n > 1 and k such that 1 < k < n, T(n, k) is involved in three sums.
%C A297673 The parity of the terms of the triangle has interesting features:
%C A297673 - For any n > 35:
%C A297673 - T(n, 1) is even,
%C A297673 - T(n, k) is odd for any k such that 1 < k < n - 34,
%C A297673 - T(n, n - 34) is even,
%C A297673 - T(n, n - k) and T(n + 64, n + 64 - k) have the same parity for k=0..34,
%C A297673 - See representation in Links section (the black pattern visible alongside the right border is eventually periodic),
%C A297673 - These features also appear in the scatterplot of the triangle as a flat sequence in the form of two branches: the first branch above the X=Y axis corresponds to the (frequent) odd terms, and the dashed branch under the X=Y axis corresponds to the (sparse) even terms.
%C A297673 This triangle has building features in common with A073671 and with A076990:
%C A297673 - for three distinct positive numbers to sum to a prime number, either all of them are odd or two of them are even and the other is odd,
%C A297673 - we have both situations here,
%C A297673 - we have only the first situation in A073671,
%C A297673 - we have only the second situation in A076990.
%C A297673 See also A297615 for a similar triangle.
