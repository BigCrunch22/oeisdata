%N A297307 Given n, define the sequence x(1) = n, thereafter if x(i) is even set x(i+1) = x(i)/2, if x(i) is odd and divisible by 3, 5 or 7 set x(i+1) = 5*x(i) + 1, otherwise set x(i+1) = 3*x(i) + 1. Then a(n) is the smallest i>1 such that x(i) = 1, 5, or 553, or -1 if none of those numbers is ever reached.

%C A297307 This is the Syracuse sequence modified by adding a constraint.
%C A297307 if x is odd and divisible by 3 or 5 or 7 then x = 5*x + 1 instead of x = 3x + 1, and x = 3*x + 1 if not divisible by 3 or 5 or 7.
%C A297307 The sequence if x even then x = x/2 and if x odd then x = 5*x + 1 diverge for n even > 12 or n odd > 5.
%C A297307 More than 1/3 of the odd numbers are divisible by 3 or 5 or 7 so this sequence will diverge or if not the Syracuse sequence will converge, it is easy to find that with the constraint added this sequence converges but with different cycles which are function of the n starting point.
%C A297307 There are 3 different cycles to end this sequence with the repetition of the cycle.
%C A297307 The main one is with a cycle of 6 values 5, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10 for 3/4 of the n values.
%C A297307 The second one is the same as the Syracuse sequence 1,4,2 for 21/100 of the n values.
%C A297307 And a third with a cycle of 175 values starting 553, 2766, 1383, 6916 ... for 3.3/100 of the n values.
%e A297307 n = 1, x(1) = 1 , x(2)= 4, x(3) = 2, x(4) = 1 so a(1) = 4.
