%N A297353 a(n) is the smallest positive number not yet in the sequence that if n is odd, contains the smallest digit in a(n-1), and if n is even, contains the largest digit in a(n-1); a(1)=0.
%C A297353 The 1-digit numbers appear in the sequence in the following order: 0,2,1,3,4,6,7,5,8,9.
%C A297353 After the initial terms, the sequence oscillates about the line y=x.
%C A297353 The first differences are bounded by 30 and -36 for the initial terms, then by 20 and -20. After the first 121 terms the sequence is bounded most of the time by 10 and -10, with eventual jumps that seem to remain bounded by 36 and -36.

%e A297353 a(2)=10 since it is the smallest number not yet in the sequence that contains the largest digit in a(1)=0; a(3)=20 since it is the smallest number not yet in the sequence that contains the smallest digit in a(2)=10; a(4)=2 since it is the smallest number not yet in the sequence that contains the largest digit in a(3)=20.
