%N A297103 The number of equal-sized squares in the highest stack of squares contained in successive Genealodrons formed from 2^n - 1 equal-sized squares.
%C A297103 The first Genealodron consists of one square.
%C A297103 The second Genealodron is formed by joining another equal-sized square to the left edge and to the right edge of the first so that the second Genealodron is made up of three squares.
%C A297103 The third Genealodron is formed by joining squares to the upper and lower edges of both the second and third square of the second Genealodron so that the third Genealodron is made up of seven squares.
%C A297103 The fourth Genealodron is formed by joining squares to the left and right edges of the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh squares of the third Genealodron so that the fourth Genealodron has fifteen squares. The fourth Genealodron has the first overlaps, so although it contains 15 squares only 13 are seen when it is viewed from above.
%C A297103 The fifth Genealodron is formed by adding 16 more squares to the upper and lower edges of the last eight squares added to the fourth Genealodron so the fifth Genealodron has 31 squares, only 21 of which are seen when it is viewed from above because of the increasing number of overlaps.
%C A297103 The sixth Genealodron is formed by adding 32 more squares to the left and right edge of the last 16 squares added to the fifth Genealodron. So the sixth Genealodron has 63 squares only 31 of which are visible.
%C A297103 This continues, and the edges on which the new squares are added keep alternating between left and right and then upper and lower.
%C A297103 Gradually within the Genealodron, spirals are building counterclockwise and clockwise. The sequence that the Genealodron built with squares generates is different from the one built with equilateral triangles, because when a square is added, the spiral then turns through 90 degrees rather than just 60 degrees.
