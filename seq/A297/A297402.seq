%N A297402 a(n) = gcd_{k=1..n} (prime(k+1)^n-1)/2.
%C A297402 If p is an odd prime and p^n is the length of the odd leg of a primitive Pythagorean triangle it constrains the other leg and hypotenuse to be (p^(2n)-1)/2 and (p^(2n)+1)/2. The resulting triangle has a semiperimeter of p^n(p^n+1)/2, an area of (p^n-1)p^n(p^n+1)/4 and an inradius of (p^n-1)/2. a(n) equals the GCD of the inradius terms (p^n-1)/2 for at least the first n odd primes.
%C A297402 Conjecture: a(n) equals the GCD of the inradius terms (p^n-1)/2 for all odd primes, i.e. a(n) = GCD_{k=1..oo} (prime(k+1)^n-1)/2.
%C A297402 From _David A. Corneth_, Dec 29 2017: (Start)
%C A297402 All terms are powers of 2. Proof: suppose p | a(n) for some odd prime p. Then p | (p^n - 1) / 2 and so p | (p^n - 1) which isn't the case.
%C A297402 If n is odd then a(n) = 1. Proof: 2 | (p^k - 1) for all k and odd primes p. 3^n - 1 = 3 * 9^k - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2 (mod 4), so 3^n - 1 is of the form 2*m for some odd m, hence the GCD of all (p^n - 1) / 2 is 1 for odd n. (End)
%C A297402 This is the even bisection of A059159. - _RÃ©my Sigrist_, Dec 30 2017
%C A297402 a(n) is the size of the group Z_2*/(Z_2*)^n, where Z_2 is the ring of 2-adic integers. We have that Z_2*/(Z_2*)^n is the inverse limit of (Z/2^iZ)*/((Z/2^iZ)*)^n as i tends to infinity. If n is odd, then the group is trivial. If n = 2^e * n' is even, where n' is odd, then the group is the product of a cyclic group of order 2^e and a cyclic group of order 2.

%F A297402 It appears that for m > 0, a(2m-1) = 1 (proved in comments) and a(2m) = 2^(k+1) where k is the exponent of the even prime in the prime factorization of 2m. - _Frank M Jackson_, Jul 28 2018

%e A297402 a(4)=8 because for n=4 and for the first 4 odd primes {3, 5, 7, 11}, the term (p^n-1)/2 gives {40, 312, 1200, 7320} with a GCD of 8.
