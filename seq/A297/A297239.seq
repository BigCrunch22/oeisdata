%N A297239 Total variation of base-13 digits of n; see Comments.
%C A297239 Suppose that a number n has base-b digits b(m), b(m-1), ..., b(0).  The base-b down-variation of n is the sum DV(n,b) of all d(i)-d(i-1) for which d(i) > d(i-1); the base-b up-variation of n is the sum UV(n,b) of all d(k-1)-d(k) for which d(k) < d(k-1).  The total base-b variation of n is the sum TV(n,b) = DV(n,b) + UV(n,b).  See A297330 for a guide to related sequences and partitions of the natural numbers:
