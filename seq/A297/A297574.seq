%N A297574 Least integer m > n such that 2^m == 2^n (mod m*n).
%C A297574 That a(n) exists for any n > 0 follows from the following theorem.
%C A297574 Theorem: For any integer a and positive integer n, there are infinitely many positive integers m such that a^m == a^n (mod m*n).
%C A297574 Proof. This is obvious for a = 0, 1, -1. Below we assume |a| > 1. Let v be the largest divisor of n coprime to a, and write n = u*v. By Dirichlet's theorem, there are infinitely many primes q > max{|a|,v} such that q == 1 (mod phi(v)), where phi(.) is Euler's totient function. Note that q, u and v are pairwise coprime. Set m = n*q. Then m*n = q*u^2*v^2. For any prime divisor p of a, clearly ord_p(a^m-a^n) >= n >= 2*ord_p(n) since p^n >= n^2 except for the case p = 2 and n = 3. So u^2 divides a^m-a^n. As q does not divide a, by Fermat's little theorem we have a^m-a^n = a^n*(a^{(q-1)n}-1) == 0 (mod q). As v is coprime to a, and phi(v^2) = v*phi(v) divides (q-1)*n = m-n, by Euler's theorem we have a^m == a^n (mod v^2). Combining the above we see that m*n = q*u^2*v^2 divides a^m-a^n. This ends the proof.
%C A297574 Conjecture: Let A and B be integers with A^2 not equal to 4*B. Let u(0) = 0, u(1) = 1, and u(n+1) = A*u(n) - B*u(n-1) for n > 0. Also, let v(0) = 2, v(1) = A, and v(n+1) = A*v(n) - B*v(n-1) for n > 0. Then, for any integer n > 0, there are infinitely many positive integers m such that u(m) == u(n) (mod m*n). Also, for any integer n > 0, there are infinitely many positive integers m such that v(m) == v(n) (mod m*n).
