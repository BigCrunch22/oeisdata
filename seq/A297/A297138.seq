%N A297138 Numbers having a down-first zigzag pattern in base 7; see Comments.
%C A297138 A number n having base-b digits d(m), d(m-1),..., d(0) such that d(i) != d(i+1) for 0 <= i < m shows a zigzag pattern of one or more segments, in the following sense.  Writing U for up and D for down, there are two kinds of patterns:  U, UD, UDU, UDUD, ... and D, DU, DUD, DUDU, ... .  In the former case, we say n has an "up-first zigzag pattern in base b"; in the latter, a "down-first zigzag pattern in base b".  Example:    2,4,5,3,0,1,4,2 has segments 2,4,5; 5,3,0; 0,1,4; and 4,2, so that 24530142, with pattern UDUD, has an up-first zigzag pattern in base 10, whereas 4,2,5,3,0,1,4,2 has a down-first pattern.  The sequences A297137-A297139 partition the natural numbers.  See the guide at A297146.
%e A297138 Base-7 digits of 5000: 2,0,4,0,2, with pattern DUDU, so that 5000 is in the sequence.
