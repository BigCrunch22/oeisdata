%N A297065 Starting with a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(n) = smallest nonnegative integer not yet in the sequence that shares all digits with previous terms.
%C A297065 Without the restriction that no repeated digits are allowed (as in A297062), the sequence is infinite.
%C A297065 The smallest 10-digit term is 1023456789, the largest 10-digit term is 9876543210, and digits not contained in previous terms are introduced at n = 6, 15, 33, 129, 729, 5049, 40329, 362889.
%e A297065 a(6)=102 and not 110 since 102 < 110, hence the digit 2 is introduced at n=6.
%Y A297065 Cf. A297062.
