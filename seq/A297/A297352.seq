%N A297352 a(n) is the smallest positive number not yet in the sequence that if n is even, contains the smallest digit in a(n-1), and if n is odd, contains the largest digit in a(n-1); a(1)=0.
%C A297352 The 1-digit numbers appear in the sequence in the following order: 0,1,3,2,4,5,7,6,8,9.
%C A297352 After the first initial terms, the sequence oscillates about the line y=x.
%C A297352 The first differences are bounded by 30 and -30 for the initial terms, then by 20 and -20. After the first 122 terms the sequence is bounded most of the time by 10 and -10, with eventual jumps that seem to remain bounded by 30 and -30.
%C A297352 Inverse: 1, 3, 11, 7, 15, 21, 31, 27, 37, 41, 2, 4, 5, 6, 16, 22, 32, 28, 36, 42, 10, 12, 13, 8, 14, 20, ..., . - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Dec 29 2017
%C A297352 Also: a(0) = 0 (and 0 counts as a digit). For n > 0, if n is odd respectively even then a(n) is the smallest integer not already in the sequence that contains the smallest respectively largest digit of a(n - 1). - _David A. Corneth_, Dec 29 2017

%e A297352 a(2)=10 since it is the smallest number not yet in the sequence that contains the smallest digit in a(1)=0; a(3)=1 since it is the smallest number not yet in the sequence that contains the largest digit in a(2)=10.
