%N A007225 Number of distinct perforation patterns for deriving (v,b) = (n+4,n) punctured convolutional codes from (2,1).
%C A007225 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jul 27 2020: (Start)
%C A007225 "A punctured convolutional code is a high-rate code obtained by the periodic elimination (i.e., puncturing) of specific code symbols from the output of a low-rate encoder. The resulting high-rate code depends on both the low-rate code, called the original code, and the number and specific positions of the punctured symbols." (The quote is from Haccoun and Bégin (1989).)
%C A007225 A high-rate code (v,b) (written as R = b/v) can be constructed from a low-rate code (v0,1) (written as R = 1/v0) by deleting from every v0*b code symbols a number of v0*b - v symbols (so that the resulting rate is R = b/v).
%C A007225 Even though the formulas below do not appear in the two published papers in the IEEE Transactions on Communications, from the theory in those two papers, it makes sense to replace "k|b" with "k|v0*b" (and "k|gcd(v,b)" with "k|gcd(v,v0*b)"). Pab Ter, however, uses "k|b" in the Maple program below. (End)

%F A007225 The number of perforation patterns to derive high-rate convolutional code (v,b) (written as R = b/v) from a given low-rate convolutional code (v0, 1) (written as R = 1/v0) is (1/b)*Sum_{k|gcd(v,b)} phi(k)*binomial(v0*b/k, v/k).
%F A007225 According to Pab Ter's Maple code, this is the coefficient of z^v in the polynomial (1/b)*Sum_{k|b} phi(k)*(1 + z^k)^(v0*b/k).
%F A007225 Here (v,b) = (n+4,n) and (v0,1) = (2,1), so
%F A007225 a(n) = (1/n)*Sum_{k|gcd(n+4,n)} phi(k)*binomial(2*n/k, (n+4)/k).
%F A007225 This simplifies to
%F A007225 a(n) = (1/n)*(binomial(2*n, n+4) + [(n mod 2) == 0]*binomial(n, (n/2) + 2) + 2*[(n mod 4) == 0]*binomial(n/2, (n/4) + 1)). (End)
