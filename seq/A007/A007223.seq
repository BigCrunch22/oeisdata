%N A007223 Number of distinct perforation patterns for deriving (v,b) = (n+2,n) punctured convolutional codes from (2,1).
%C A007223 Number of ways to distribute n pairs parentheses into 2 groups where each group of parentheses represents a Catalan ordering (A000108), and each group must contain at least one pair of parentheses. If one of the groups may have no parentheses, we arrive at A007595. Analog of A274934 with Catalan numbers replacing connected graph counts. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jul 19 2016
%C A007223 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jul 27 2020: (Start)
%C A007223 "A punctured convolutional code is a high-rate code obtained by the periodic elimination (i.e., puncturing) of specific code symbols from the output of a low-rate encoder. The resulting high-rate code depends on both the low-rate code, called the original code, and the number and specific positions of the punctured symbols." (The quote is from Haccoun and Bégin (1989).)
%C A007223 A high-rate code (v,b) (written as R = b/v) can be constructed from a low-rate code (v0,1) (written as R = 1/v0) by deleting from every v0*b code symbols a number of v0*b - v symbols (so that the resulting rate is R = b/v).
%C A007223 Even though the formulas below do not appear in the two published papers in the IEEE Transactions on Communications, from the theory in those two papers, it makes sense to replace "k|b" with "k|v0*b" (and "k|gcd(v,b)" with "k|gcd(v,v0*b)"). Pab Ter, however, uses "k|b" in the Maple program below. (End)

%F A007223 Conjecture: Expansion of [A(x)^2 + A(x^2)]/2, where A(x) = A000108(x) - 1. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jul 19 2016
%F A007223 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jul 27 2020: (Start)
%F A007223 The number of perforation patterns to derive high-rate convolutional code (v,b) (written as R = b/v) from a given low-rate convolutional code (v0, 1) (written as R = 1/v0) is (1/b)*Sum_{k|gcd(v,b)} phi(k)*binomial(v0*b/k, v/k).
%F A007223 According to Pab Ter's Maple code, this is the coefficient of z^v in the polynomial (1/b)*Sum_{k|b} phi(k)*(1 + z^k)^(v0*b/k).
%F A007223 Here (v,b) = (n+2,n) and (v0,1) = (2,1), so
%F A007223 a(n) = (1/n)*Sum_{k|gcd(n+2,n)} phi(k)*binomial(2*n/k, (n+2)/k).
%F A007223 This simplifies to
%F A007223 a(n) = (1/n)*(binomial(2*n, n+2) + [(n mod 2) == 0]*binomial(n, (n/2) + 1)).
%F A007223 It follows from my comments in A275206 that _R. J. Mathar_'s conjecture is correct and that
%F A007223 a(n) = (-2*c(n) + c(n+1) + [(n mod 2) == 0]*c(n/2))/2 for n >= 1, where c = A000108. (End)
