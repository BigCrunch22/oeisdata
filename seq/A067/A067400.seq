%N A067400 Non-uniquely factorizable OR-numbrals, i.e., numbrals for which there exist more than one different factorizations into irreducible factors (modulo order).
%C A067400 See A048888 for the definition of OR-numbral arithmetic.
%e A067400 15 is in A067400 since [15] = [3] * [5] = [3]^3 and [3] and [5] are irreducible.
