%N A067814 The start of a record-breaking run of consecutive integers with a number of prime factors (counted with multiplicity) equal to 4.
%C A067814 3405122 is the first number having 8 and 9 consecutive integers with 4 prime factors. - _T. D. Noe_, Mar 19 2014
%e A067814 a(4)=4023 because 4023 is the start of a record breaking run of 4 consecutive integers (4023 to 4026) each having 4 prime factors; i.e. bigomega(n)=A001222(n)=4 for n = 4023, ..., 4026.
