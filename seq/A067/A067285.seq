%N A067285 a(n) = smallest integer k such that k is not of the form m + reverse(m) for any m (cf. A067031) and A067030(n) occurs in the 'Reverse and Add' trajectory of k.

%e A067285 a(14) = 7, since A067030(14) = 55 and the five integers 7, 23, 32, 41, 50 are not of the form m + reverse(m) for any m, 55 occurs in the trajectory of each of them and 7 is the smallest one. a(25) = 1, since A067030(25) = 154 and the eleven integers 1, 25, 34, 43, 52, 59, 61, 68, 70, 86, 95 are not of the form m + reverse(m) for any m, 154 occurs in the trajectory of each of them and 1 is the smallest one.
