%N A067288 Records for the number of integers k such that k is not of the form m + reverse(m) for any m and for some n A067030(n) occurs in the 'Reverse and Add' trajectory of k (cf. A067284).
%C A067288 Successive maxima in sequence A067284. A067287 gives the corresponding integers at which these records are attained.
%H A067288 <a href="/index/Res#RAA">Index entries for sequences related to Reverse and Add!</a>
%e A067288 3 is a record, since for A067030(12) = 33 there are three integers k not of the form j + reverse(j) for any j such that 33 occurs in the "Reverse and Add!" trajectory of these k and for m < 33 there are at most two integers which have the corresponding property.
