%N A067873 Numbers x satisfying x^2 - D*y^2 = 1 for more than one value of D distinct from x^2 - 1.
%C A067873 The sequence contains A056220(n) for n>1. For a given x, solutions (x,y) to x^2 - D*y^2 = 1 do not all stand for the least nontrivial positive solution pair. For instance, x=244 solves the latter equation for D=15 and D=135 with corresponding y=63 and y=21. While (244,21) is indeed the fundamental solution to x^2 - 135*y^2 = 1, (244,63) comes only as the third one after the solution pairs (4,1) and (31,8) to x^2 - 15*y^2 = 1.
%C A067873 Sequence includes mostly odd entries in consecutive pairs. It seems reasonable to conjecture that an even entry e satisfies big omega(E) - omega(E) > 2, where E = e^2 - 1. (See A001222 and A001221.)
