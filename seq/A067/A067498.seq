%N A067498 Maximum number of reflections for a ray of light which reflects at n points (reflecting more than once at most or all points).
%C A067498 The maxima occur when the points of reflection are arranged at the vertices of a regular n-gon and the ray (except entering and leaving) follows the edges and diagonals of the polygon.
