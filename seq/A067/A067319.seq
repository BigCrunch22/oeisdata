%N A067319 Numbers n such that phi(n)^phi(n)+1 is prime.
%C A067319 It is conjectured that the sequence of Fermat primes (A019434) is complete; if so then this sequence is complete:
%C A067319 Suppose that x is a positive integer for which x^x+1 is prime. If x has an odd prime factor p, then x^x + 1 = (x^(x/p))^p + 1 is divisible by x^(x/p) + 1, so it is not prime. So x must be a power of 2. Hence x^x is also a power of 2, so x^x+1 is a Fermat prime.
%C A067319 If there are no Fermat primes beyond the known ones (as is widely believed), then x must be 1, 2, or 4. Letting x=phi(n), it is easy to see that n must be one of the numbers listed. - _Dean Hickerson_, Feb 11 2002
%e A067319 Cases n=1-12 are based on the primes 2, 5, 257.
