%N A067281 Number of permutations of {1,2,3,...,n} where the elements of n are considered indistinguishable if they differ by a power of 2 (for example 3, 12 and 24 are all considered equivalent).
%C A067281 Alternatively, one can think of these sequences as permutation of {1,2,...,n} where the term n corresponds to the appropriate ideal in Z[1/2]. This description gives an obvious generalization to Z[1/n] or other localizations of Z.
%C A067281 The conjecture a(2n+1)=(2n+1)a(2n) is obviously true from the definition of the sequence and the fact that 2n+1 is the smallest element of its equivalence class. - Brian Rothbach (rothbach(AT)Math.Berkeley.EDU), Sep 15 2004
%C A067281 a(2n+1) = (2n+1)*a(2n). However, a(n+1)/a(n) is non-integral for n = {3, 15, 19...}.
%e A067281 a(6)=20 since {1,2,3,4,5,6} becomes {1,1,3,1,5,3} which has 60 permutations.
