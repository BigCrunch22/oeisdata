%e A067737 44 = A067030(13) is in the sequence, since there are five integers k (viz. 5, 13, 20, 31, 40; A067284(13) = 5) such that k is not of the form m + reverse(m) for any m and 44 occurs in the "Reverse and Add!" trajectory of k, but only four integers k (viz. 13, 22, 31, 40; A067032(13) = 4) such that 44 = k + reverse(k).
