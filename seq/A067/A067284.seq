%N A067284 a(n) = number of integers k such that k is not of the form m + reverse(m) for any m (cf. A067031) and A067030(n) occurs in the 'Reverse and Add' trajectory of k.
%C A067284 For an integer j not in A067030 there exists no integer k of the form m + reverse(m) such that j occurs in the trajectory of k. a(n) >= A067032(n); A067737 gives the terms of A067030 such that a(n) > A067032(n). A067288 gives the records in this sequence, A067287 gives the terms of A067030 at which these records are attained.

%e A067284 a(14) = 5, since A067030(14) = 55 and the five integers 7, 23, 32, 41, 50 are not of the form m + reverse(m) for any m and 55 occurs in the trajectory of each of them. a(25) = 11, since A067030(25) = 154 and the eleven integers 1, 25, 34, 43, 52, 59, 61, 68, 70, 86, 95 are not of the form m + reverse(m) for any m and 154 occurs in the trajectory of each of them.
