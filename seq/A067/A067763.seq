%N A067763 Square array read by antidiagonals of base n numbers written as 122...222 with k 2's (and a suitable interpretation for n=0, 1 or 2).
%C A067763 Start with a node; step one is to connect that node to n+1 new nodes so that it is of degree n+1; further steps are to connect each existing node of degree 1 to n new nodes so that it is of degree n+1; T(n,k) is the total number of nodes after k steps.
%F A067763 T(n, k) =((n+1)*n^k-2)/(n-1) [with T(1, k)=2k+1] =n*T(n, k-1)+2 =(n+1)*T(n, k-1)-n*T(n, k-2) =T(n, k-1)+(1+1/n)*n^k =A055129(k, n)+A055129(k-1, n). Coefficient of x^k in expansion of (1+x)/((1-x)(1-nx)).
%e A067763 Rows start: 1,2,2,2,2,2,...; 1,3,5,7,9,11,...; 1,4,10,22,46,94,...; 1,5,17,53,161,485,... T(3,2) =122 base 3 =17.
%Y A067763 Rows include A040000, A005408, A033484, A048473, A020989, A057651, A061801 etc. For negative n (not shown) absolute values of rows would effectively include A000012, A014113, A046717.
