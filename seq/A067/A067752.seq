%N A067752 Number of unordered solutions of xy + xz + yz = n in nonnegative integers.
%C A067752 An upper bound on the number of solutions appears to be 1.5*sqrt(n). - _T. D. Noe_, Jun 14 2006
%C A067752 a(n) is also the total number of distinct quadratic forms of discriminant -4n. A232551 counts only the primitive quadratic forms of discriminant -4n (those with all coefficients pairwise coprime) and A234287 includes those by which some prime can be represented (those with all coefficients pairwise coprime or coefficient of x^2 is prime or coefficient of y^2 is prime). This sequence includes all quadratic forms like 2x^2 + 2xy + 4y^2 and 2x^2 + 4y^2 which are non-primitive and those like 4x^2 + 2xy + 4y^2 and 4x^2 + 4xy + 4y^2 by which no prime can be represented (those with no restrictions). - _V. Raman_, Dec 24 2013
