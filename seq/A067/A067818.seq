%N A067818 Start with 1. To get a(n+1), describe a(n) in terms of the number of 0's, 1's, 2's,...,9's it has. Do not ignore leading 0's in the computation, but ignore them when listing the terms.
%C A067818 If leading 0's are not included in the computation, the sequence becomes constant after the third term.
%C A067818 Including leading 0's, the sequence oscillates between 10714213141516172819 and 10812213241516271819 from a(7) onward. - _Sean A. Irvine_, Jan 08 2024

%e A067818 1 has 0 0's, 1 1's, 0 2's, 0 3's, 0 4's, 0 5's, 0 6's, 0 7's, 0 8's, 0 9's, so the term following 1 is 00110203040506070809. Ignore the two leading zeros when listing this term, but include them in the computation of the third term. The second term has 10 0's, 2 1's, 1 2's, 1 3's, 1 4's, 1 5's, 1 6's, 1 7's, 1 8's, 1 9's, so the third term is 100211213141516171819.
