%N A067126 Numbers for which phi(n) >= phi(k) for all k = 1 to n-1.
%C A067126 Conjecture: 4 and 9 are the only composite terms.
%C A067126 No more composite terms below 1.5e18. Such a term would require a prime gap greater than sqrt(p); in the absence of such large gaps, a(n) = prime(n-2) for n > 6. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Apr 12 2010
%e A067126 4 is a term as phi(4)=2 and phi(1), phi(2), phi(3) are <= 2. 16 is not a term as phi(16) < phi(11).
