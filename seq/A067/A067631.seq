%N A067631 If n is composite then a(n) is the standard deviation of the prime factors of n, rounded off to the nearest integer (rounding up if there's a choice), with each factor counted according to its frequency of occurrence in the prime factorization. If n is 1 or prime then a(n)=0.
%C A067631 The (sample) standard deviation sigma of {x_1,...,x_n} is calculated from sigma^2 = 1/(n-1) * sum_{1,...,n}(x_i - mu)^2, where mu denotes the average of {x_1,...,x_n}.
%e A067631 24 = 2^3 * 3^1, so the corresponding average = (2 + 2 + 2 + 3)/ 4 = 2.25 and the standard deviation is [(1/3){3 * (2-2.25)^2 + (3-2.25)^2}]^0.5 = 0.5, which rounds to 1. So a(24) = 1.
