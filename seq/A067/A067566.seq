%N A067566 Smallest k such that k = n*A001414(k) (or 0 if no such k exists), where A001414(k) is the integer log of k, i.e., Sum p_i*e_i if the prime factorization of k is Product p_i^e_i.
%e A067566 a(3)=27 since 27 = 3^3 and 27 = 3*(3*3), but not 30 even though 30 = 2^1*3^1*5^1 and 30 = 3*(2*1+3*1+5*1) because 27 is less than 30.
