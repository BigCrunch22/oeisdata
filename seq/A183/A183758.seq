%N A183758 Unlabeled super-Catalan numbers: patterns of nonintersecting chords joining unlabeled points on a flippable circle.
%C A183758 Interpret the super-Catalan sequence (A001003) as follows:  Ways to insert parentheses in a string of n+1 symbols. The parentheses must be balanced but there is no restriction on the number of pairs of parentheses. The number of letters inside a pair of parentheses must be at least 2. Parentheses enclosing the whole string are ignored.  Now picture the x's and parentheses as equally spaced unlabeled points on a circle with chords joining paired parentheses and x's having no chord. Circles thus produced may have n+1, n+3, ..., 3*n-1 points and up to n-1 chords. The circle may be rotated and flipped over. a(n) is the count of unique patterns.
%e A183758 A183757(3) = 6: (xx)xx, (xx)(xx), (xxx)x, ((xx)x)x, x(x(xx)), xxxx and removing the reflected pattern x(x(xx)) leaves a(3) = 5.
%Y A183758 Cf. A001003 super-Catalan numbers. A183757 similar but counts reflections. A183760 this sequence decomposed by number of chords in the circles.
