%N A183422 Ordering of the numbers in the tree A183420; complement of A183423.
%F A183422 The monotonic ordering of the numbers in the set S generated by these rules:  2 is in S, and if n is in S, then n^2+4*n+2 and n+Floor[1/2+sqrt(n+2)] is in S.
%e A183422 The complementary trees A183420 and A183421 contain initial terms (2,14,4,254,18,34,6,...) and (1,7,3,79,10,23,5,...).  A183422 comes from arranging in increasing order the numbers in the first tree: (2,4,6,9,,12,14,...), these being complementary to the numbers in the second tree.
