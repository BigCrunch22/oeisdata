%N A183122 Magnetic Tower of Hanoi, number of moves of disk number k, generated by a certain algorithm, yielding a "forward moving" non-optimal solution of the [NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL] pre-colored puzzle.
%C A183122 A.   The Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle is described in link 1 listed below. The Magnetic Tower is pre-colored. Pre-coloring is [NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL], given in [Source ; Intermediate ; Destination] order. The solution algorithm producing the presented sequence is NOT optimal. The particular "62" algorithm solving the puzzle at hand is presented and discussed in the paper referenced by link 1 below. For the optimal solution of the Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle with the given pre-coloring configuration (the "natural" or "free" Magnetic Tower) see A183117 and A183118. Optimal solutions are discussed and their optimality is proved in link 2 listed below.
%C A183122 B.   Disk numbering is from largest disk (k = 1) to smallest disk (k = N)
%C A183122 C.   The above-listed "original" sequence generates a "partial-sums" sequence - describing the total number of moves required to solve the puzzle.
%C A183122 D.   Number of moves of disk k, for large k, is close to (67/108)*3^(k-1) ~ 0.62*3^(k-1). Series designation: P62(k).
