%N A183990 Indices of pairs with (odd i, even j) in list of pairs (i,j) ordered by value of i+j*r, where r=(1+sqrt(5))/2, i>=0, j>=0.
%C A183990 This is obviously the same as rankings of (even i, odd j) when ordered according to i+j/r, since the position of the pair in the original list does not matter. [Observation of _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Feb 13 2011.]
%e A183990 Writing (i,j) for i+r*j, the first 7 in the ranking are
%e A183990 (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (2,0), (1,1), (3,0), (0,2);
%e A183990 the ranks where i is odd and j is even are a(1)=2 and a(2)=6. If sorted according to the value of i+j/r, the list is the same with i,j exchanged.
%Y A183990 Cf. A183987, A183988, A183989, A183991, A183992, A183993.
