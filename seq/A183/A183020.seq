%N A183020 Largest members of k-sociable cycles of order r, with k > 1 and r > 1.
%C A183020 A k-sociable (or multisociable) cycle of order r consists of r distinct positive integers such that the sum of the aliquot divisors (or proper divisors) of each is equal to k times the next term in the cycle, where k (the multiplicity) is a fixed positive integer.
%C A183020 In this sequence, a(1), a(2) and a(4) are the largest terms of 2-sociable cycles of order 3 (or bicrowds), and a(3) is the larger term of a 3-sociable cycle of order 2 (or triamicable pair).
%C A183020 No other terms <= 10^12.
%Y A183020 Cf. A001065, A166069, A183013, A183021, A183022.
