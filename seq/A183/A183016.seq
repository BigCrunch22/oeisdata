%N A183016 Conjectured list of smallest terms of k-sociable cycles of order r.
%C A183016 A k-sociable (or multisociable) cycle of order r consists of r distinct positive integers such that the sum of the aliquot divisors (or proper divisors) of each is equal to k times the next term in the cycle, where k (the multiplicity) is a fixed positive integer.
%C A183016 A183017(n) gives the multiplicity of the cycle with smallest term a(n).
%C A183016 A183018(n) gives the order of the cycle with smallest term a(n).
%C A183016 If examples of two or more multisociable cycles with the same smallest term exist, the smallest term is repeated in this sequence, and corresponding multiplicities listed in order of increasing size in A183017. (No such examples are known. Do any exist?)
