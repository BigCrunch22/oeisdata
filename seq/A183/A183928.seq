%N A183928 Number of nondecreasing arrangements of n numbers in -2..2 with sum zero and sum of squares less than 2n.

%C A183928 From _David A. Corneth_, Oct 21 2017: (Start)
%C A183928 Let x_i be the number of numbers in such an arrangement with |i| = 2. Then x_1 + 4*x_2 < 2*n and x_1 is even, x_1 + x_2 != 1.
%C A183928 A pair (x_1, x_2) has a fixed number of arrangements corresponding to it, independent of the number of zeros in the arrangement, hence independent of n. For example, for (x_1, x_2) = (2, 1), we could find the arrangements (-1, -1, 2) and (-2, 1, 1) and from there on find some solutions counted in n = 4 (see example below) by putting an extra 0 to each arrangement to find (-1, -1, 0, 2) and (-2, 0, 1, 1).
%C A183928 For some n, we might find that (x_1, x_2) is feasible by the restrictions above. If all those 1's and 2's are signed positive, their sums become S = x_1 + 2 * x_2. We then change signs of 1's and 2's such that the sum of all terms is 0. If we change the sign of 1 from + to -, the total is reduced by 2 * 1 = 2. Similarily, if we change the sign of 2 from + to -, we reduce the total by 2*2 = 4. Let s_i be the number of i's whose signs we change from + to -, x_i - s_i, s_i >= 0. So the sum S must be even. We get the new sum 0 = (x_1 - 2*s_1) + (2 * x_2 - 2*s_2) = x_1 + 2 * x_2 - 2 * (s_1 + s_2) = S - 2 * (s_1 + s_2). I.e., s_1 + s_2 = S/2, which is a Diophantine equation. Note that the solution to this equation can be used for computation of various values of a(n). See the example for an application.

%e A183928 Suppose we try to find a(6) and see that (0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2) has sum of squares <= 2*6 = 12. This corresponds to x_1 = x_2 = 2 and gives S = x_1 + 2*x_2 = 2 + 2*2 = 6. We change signs so that s_1 + 2*s_2 = S/2 = 6/2 = 3, with s_1, s_2 in {0, 1, 2}. We see that (s_1, s_2) in {(1, 1)} so the only solution for this is (0, 0, -1, 1, -2, 2) which is (-2, -1, 0, 0, 1, 2) when sorted. - _David A. Corneth_, Oct 24 2017
