%N A183013 Largest members of k-sociable cycles of order r.
%C A183013 A k-sociable (or multisociable) cycle of order r consists of r distinct positive integers such that the sum of the aliquot divisors (or proper divisors) of each is equal to k times the next term in the cycle, where k (the multiplicity) is a fixed positive integer.
%C A183013 A183014(n) gives the multiplicity of the cycle with largest term a(n).
%C A183013 A183015(n) gives the order of the cycle with largest term a(n).
%C A183013 If examples of two or more multisociable cycles with the same largest term exist, the largest term is repeated in this sequence, and corresponding multiplicities listed in order of increasing size in A183014. (No such examples are known. Do any exist?)
