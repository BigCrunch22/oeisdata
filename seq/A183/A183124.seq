%N A183124 Magnetic Tower of Hanoi, number of moves of disk number n, generated by a certain algorithm, yielding a "forward moving" non-optimal solution of the [NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL] pre-colored puzzle.
%C A183124 The Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle is described in the preprint of March 2010. The Magnetic Tower is pre-colored. Pre-coloring is [NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL ; NEUTRAL], given in [Source ; Intermediate ; Destination] order. The solution algorithm producing the presented sequence is NOT optimal. The particular "61" algorithm solving the puzzle at hand is not explicitly presented in any of the referenced papers. For the optimal solution of the Magnetic Tower of Hanoi puzzle with the given pre-coloring configuration (the "natural" or "free" Magnetic Tower) see A183117 and A183118. Optimal solutions are discussed and their optimality is proved in the preprint of Nov 2010.
%C A183124 Disk numbering is from largest disk (k = 1) to smallest disk (k = N).
%C A183124 The above-listed "original" sequence generates a "partial-sums" sequence - describing the total number of moves required to solve the puzzle.
%C A183124 Number of moves of disk k, for large k, is close to (197/324)*3^(k-1) ~ 0.61*3^(k-1). Series designation: P61(k).
