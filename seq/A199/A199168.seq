%N A199168 Numbers whose digits are a permutation of (0,...,m) for some m.
%C A199168 2013 is the fourth odd term in this sequence: Up to and including the 5 digit terms, odd terms must end in 1 or 3.
%C A199168 Due to the fact that 0 is not allowed as initial digit, this sequence is quite different from A030299, the analog with digits (1,...,m) instead of (0,...,m).
