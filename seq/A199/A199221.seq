%N A199221 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = (n+1-k)*|s(n,n+1-k)| - 2*|s(n-1,n-k)|, where s(n,k) are the signed Stirling numbers of the first kind and 1 <= k <= n.
%C A199221 Use the T(n,k) as coefficients to generate a polynomial of degree n-1 in d as Sum_{k=1..n} T(n,k)d^(k-1) and let f(n) be the greatest root of this polynomial. Then a polygon of n sides that form a harmonic progression in the ratio 1 : 1/(1+d) : 1/(1+2d) : ... : 1/(1+(n-1)d) can only exist if the common difference d of the denominators is limited to the range f(n) < d < g(n). The higher limit g(n) is the greatest root of another group of polynomials defined by coefficients in the triangle A199220.
%F A199221 The triangle of coefficients can be generated by expanding the equation (Sum_{k=1..n} 1/(1+(k-1)d)) - 2/(1+(n-1)d) = 0 into a polynomial of degree n-1 in d.
