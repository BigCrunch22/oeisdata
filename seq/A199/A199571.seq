%N A199571 Table version of the array of number of round trips of length L from any of the N vertices of the cycle graph C_N.
%C A199571 Let w(N,L) be the number of return paths (round trip walks) of length L >= 0 from any vertex of the cycle graph C_N, N >= 1. (Due to cyclic symmetry, this array w(N,L) is independent of the start vertex.) w(N,L) = trace(AC(N)^L)/N = Sum_{k=0..N-1} x^{(N)}_k, with the N X N adjacency matrix AC(N) of the cycle graph C_N, and x^{(N)}_k are the zeros of the characteristic polynomial C(N,x) of AC(N). See A198637 for the coefficient triangle for C(N,x). C(N,x) = 2*(T(N,x/2)-1) for N >= 2. These zeros are x^{(N)}_k = 2*cos(2*Pi*k/N), N >= 2 (from T(N,x/2)=1). For N=1 one has C(1,x)=x with x^{(1)}_0 = 0. This sum formula for w(n,L) has been given in a comment to A054877 (N=5 case) by H. Kociemba. For N=1 one uses 0^0 := 1 to obtain w(1,L) = delta(L,0) (Kronecker's delta-symbol).
%C A199571 The o.g.f. G(N,x) := Sum_{L>=0} w(N,L)*x^L is, by a general result on moments of zeros of polynomials (see the W. Lang reference, theorem 5, p. 244),
%C A199571   y*(d/dx)C(N,x)/(N*C(N,x)), with y=1/x. This becomes for N >= 2: G(N,x) = y*S(N-1,y)/(2*T(N,y/2)-1) with y=1/x. For N=1 one has G(1,x)=1 (not 1/(1-2*x)). In the formula section this N >= 2 result is given explicitly, using the Binet-de Moivre form of the S- and T-polynomials.

%F A199571 a(K,L) = w(N,K-N+1), K >= 0, n=1,...,K+1, with w(N,L) defined as return walk numbers of length L of the cycle graph C_N in the comment section above.
%F A199571 w(N,L) = Sum_{k=0..N-1} (2*cos(2*Pi*k)/N)^L, N >= 2. For N=1 one has w(1,0)=1 and w(1,L)=0 if L >= 1.
%F A199571 O.g.f. G(N,x) for w(N,L): for N >= 2:
%F A199571   y*S(N-1,y)/(2*(T(N,y/2)-1)) with y=1/x, and for N=1 one has G(1,x)=1. This can, for N >= 2, be written as
%F A199571 G(N,x) = sinh(N*log(2*x/(1-sqrt(1-(2*x)^2))))/(sqrt(1-(2*x)^2)*(cosh(N*log(2*x/(1-sqrt(1-(2*x)^2))))-1)).
