%N A199973 a(n) = the sum of LCQ_B(n, k) for 1 <= k <= n (see definition in comments).
%C A199973 Definition of LCQ_B: The least common non-divisor of type B (LCQ_B) of two positive integers a and b (a<=b) is the least positive non-divisor q of numbers a and b such that 1<=q<=b common to a and b; LCQ_B(a, b) = 0 if  no such c exists.
%C A199973 LCQ_B(a, b) = 0 or >= 2.
%F A199973 For n = 6, a(6) = 9 because LCQ_B(6, 1) = 4, LCQ_B(6, 2) = 4, LCQ_B(6, 3) = 4, LCQ_B(6, 4) = 5, LCQ_B(6, 5) = 4, LCQ_B(6, 6) = 4. Sum of results is 25.
