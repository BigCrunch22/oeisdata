%N A199970  a(n) = the smallest number m with the smallest non-divisor n such that 1<n<m, or 0 if no such m exists.
%F A199970  a(n) > 0 for prime powers n = p^k (p prime, k >= 0) else 0.
%e A199970  a(7) = 60 because 60 is the smallest number such that numbers k < 7 divides 60 but number 7 is not divisor of 60.
