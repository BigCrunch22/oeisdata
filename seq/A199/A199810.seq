%N A199810 Duplicate of A199807.
%C A199810 Name was: Sorted number of polyhedral facets of distinct solutions in the mix of 2 or 3 regular convex 4-polytopes.
%C A199810 Sorted 4th column of Table 2, p. 11, of Cunningham. Once sorted, from column 1 of the same table, which is the permutation A199807, becomes the same sequence as sorted number of vertices of distinct solutions in the mix of 2 or 3 regular convex 4-polytopes.
