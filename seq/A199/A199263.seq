%N A199263 Let CardE(K) the number of elements (x, y) of the finite group defined by the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + x + 1 (mod p) including the point at infinity; a(n) is the difference between 2*sqrt(p) and |cardE(K) - (p + 1)|.
%C A199263 Hasse's theorem tells us the following estimate:
%C A199263 |cardE(K) - (p + 1)| <= 2*sqrt(p) where K = Fp is the finite field with p elements and E an elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + x + 1 (mod p) defined over K. CardE(K) is the number of elements (x, y) of the finite group defined by the elliptic curve including the point at infinity. The number of points of the curve grows roughly as the number of elements in the field. This sequence gives the integer difference: 2*sqrt(p) - |cardE(K) - (p + 1)|.
%C A199263 We obtain remarkable values such that a(38) = 0, a(258) = 0.
