%N A199636 Irregular rows of odd numbers that produce n even numbers in their Collatz iteration.
%C A199636 It is conjectured that every odd number greater than 1 eventually appears in this sequence. The smallest and largest terms in row n are A199637(n) and A199638(n). The number of terms in row n is A131450(n) for n > 3.
%C A199636 The 10th and 20th rows are A199817 and A199818.
