%N A199426 Janet helicoidal classification of the periodic table.
%C A199426 A permutation of the natural numbers up to 120 (Janet table; in OEIS Wiki, Periodic table). Or more (extension).
%C A199426 Janet explicitly published his table in reference (1), leaflet 7. This was a consequence of his helicoidal classification of the periodic table created with four tangential increasing cylinders on which the numbers are written (2), leaflet 3, (for the first 3 cylinders):

%C A199426 A boustrophedon path is used. 1 increases, 2 decreases.
%C A199426 a(n) is the vertical terms taken from bottom to top.
%C A199426 By 2 consecutive verticals the numbers of the terms are 2,2,6,2,6,2,10,6,2,... = A167268.

%F A199426 A167268/2 = 1,1,3,1,3,1,5,3,1,5,3,1,... = b(n). b(n) repeated is every term of A167268 shared in 2 equal parts: 1,1,1,1,3,3,1,1,5,5,3,3,1,1,... = c(n), distribution of verticals of (A).
%F A199426 a(n) is created by mixed increasing 1, 3,  5,6,7, 11, 13,14,15,   via b(n) (or both via c(n))
