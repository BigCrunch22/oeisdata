%N A199766 Number of Landsberg zones in the n-th Brillouin zone of a rectangular centered lattice.
%C A199766 This sequence enumerates the number of polygons that make up the n-th Brillouin zone of a two-dimensional rectangular-centered lattice. Brillouin zones play an important role in the description of wave propagation in crystals. Their tiling of the lattice's fundamental domain is also known in physics as the "reduced zone scheme", so, alternatively, this sequence enumerates the number of "pieces" in the reduced zone scheme.
