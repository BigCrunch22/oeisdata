%N A199013 Numbers which, when divided by the sum of their prime factors, give a prime number.
%C A199013 One of the prime factors of n disappears in the sum of its prime factorsâ€™ prime factors. The sequence includes 2p(p+2) whenever p and p+2 are twin primes. There are no primes or semiprimes in the sequence.
