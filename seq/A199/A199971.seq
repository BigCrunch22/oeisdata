%N A199971  a(n) = the sum of LCQ_A(n, k) for 1 <= k <= n (see definition in comments).
%C A199971  Definition of LCQ_A: The least common non-divisor of type A (LCQ_A) of two positive integers a and b (a<=b) is the least positive non-divisor q of numbers a and b such that 1<=q<=a common to a and b; LCQ_A(a, b) = 0, if  no such c exists.
%C A199971 LCQ_A(1, b) = LCQ_A(2, b) = 0 for b >=1. LCQ_A(a, b) = 0 or >= 2.
%e A199971  For n = 6, a(6) = 9 because LCQ_A(6, 1) = 0, LCQ_A(6, 2) = 0, LCQ_A(6, 3) = 0, LCQ_A(6, 4) = 0, LCQ_A(6, 5) = 4, LCQ_A(6, 6) = 4. Sum of results is 8.
