%N A199801 Primitive elements of A060355: n such that n and n+1 are powerful but n is not of the form 4m(m+1) where m and m+1 are powerful.
%C A199801 This sequence is infinite. See the comment dated Nov 19 2012 in A060355. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Nov 09 2013

%e A199801 8 and 9 are powerful and although 8 = 4*1*(1+1), 1+1 is not powerful so 8 is in this sequence.
%e A199801 288 and 289 are powerful but 288 = 4*8*(8+1) and both 8 and 8+1 are powerful so 288 is not in this sequence.
%e A199801 675 and 676 are powerful and 675 is not of the form 4m(m+1) so 675 is in this sequence.
%Y A199801 Subsequence of A060355 and hence of A001694.
%K A199801 nonn
