%N A282598 Minimal number of cuts along the edges of n-th Platonic solid required to unfold the net of the solid into the plane, in the order tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron.
%C A282598 An obvious generalization not in the OEIS: Minimal number of cuts along the faces of the cells (i.e. along the 2-faces) of the six Platonic polytopes in four dimensions required to unfold the nets of the polytopes into 3-dimensional space.
%C A282598 Each cut is along an edge, so trivially a(n) <= A063722(n). - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Feb 20 2017
