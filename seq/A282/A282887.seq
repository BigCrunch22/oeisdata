%N A282887 Sum_{k=0..n} -(-1)^issquare(p(k))*p(k), where p = A282887 is the lexicographic-first permutation of the nonnegative integers such that these sums always remain nonnegative.
%C A282887 In short: add squares, and subtract nonsquares when you can.
%C A282887 A variant of A282886 (corresponding to permutation A282840) and A282846 (corresponding to permutation A282864) and A282865; in the latter variants, "square" is replaced by "prime".
%C A282887 The graph yields a nice moir√©e pattern.

%e A282887 Starting from a(0)=0 we add the square 1 to get a(1)=1, and since we can't yet subtract 2, we also add the next larger square 4, to get a(2)=5. Then we can subtract nonsquares 2, a(3)=3, and 3, a(4)=0. Now we must add the square 9 to get a(5)=9 before subtracting the nonsquare 5, a(6)=4. Since we can't subtract the nonsquare 6, we add the square 16, a(7)=20. And so on.
