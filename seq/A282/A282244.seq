%N A282244 Lexicographic block-fractal zero-one word with initial block 01.
%C A282244 To the initial block, 01, append the lexicographically ordered missing 2-letter words (00,10,11) to get 01001011.  To that, append the missing 3-letter words to get 01001011000110111.  To that, append the missing 4-letter words to get 010010110001101110000101011101111, etc.  In the limiting word, every finite binary word occurs infinitely many times; thus, the word (or sequence) is block-fractal, as defined at A280511.
