%N A282713 Orbit of 23 under repeated applications of the inverse of the map m -> A127202(m).
%C A282713 It is known that A127202 is a permutation of the positive integers. The orbit containing 23 appears to be the first infinite orbit. See A282713 for the orbit of 23 under the permutation itself, and see A127202 for other orbits (there are several small cycles).
