%N A282573 The number of steps taken on a staircase of n steps during the following routine: Take steps of length 1 up a staircase until you can't step any further, then take steps of length 2 down until you can't step any further, and so on.

%e A282573 For n = 4:
%e A282573 step size 1: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (four steps);
%e A282573 step size 2: 4 -> 2 -> 0 (two steps);
%e A282573 step size 3: 0 -> 3 (one step).
%e A282573 Because the walker cannot take four steps down, a(4) = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.
