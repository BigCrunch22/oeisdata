%N A282443 a(n) is the largest step size that is taken on a staircase of n steps when following the following procedure: Take steps of length 1 up a staircase until you can't step any further, then take steps of length 2 down until you can't step any further, and so on.

%F A282443 a(n) = A282442(n) - 1.
%e A282443 For n = 4:
%e A282443 step size 1: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4;
%e A282443 step size 2: 4 -> 2 -> 0;
%e A282443 step size 3: 0 -> 3.
%e A282443 Because the walker cannot take four steps down, the biggest step size is 3.
%e A282443 Therefore a(4) = 3.
