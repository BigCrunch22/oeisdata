%N A282649 The larger term of the pair (a(n), a(n+1)) is always prime.
%C A282649 The sequence is started with a(1) = 1 and always extended with the smallest integer not yet present and not leading to a contradiction. The sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.

%C A282649 Let p_k = A000040(k) and c_k = A002808(k), the data can be written:
%C A282649 1, p_1, p_2, p_3, c_1, p_4, c_2, p_5, c_3, p_6, c_4, p_7, ...
%C A282649 At the 4th term, begins the alternating pattern:
%C A282649 {p_3, c_1, p_4, c_2, p_5, c_3, ..., p_(m+2), c_m, ...}.
%C A282649 The terms with odd index are 1, p_2, c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5, ...;
%C A282649 the terms with even index are p_1, p_3, p_4, p_5, p_6, p_7, ... This is A045344. (End)
