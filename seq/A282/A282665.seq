%N A282665 The larger term of the pair (a(n), a(n+1)) is always even and the larger digit of any pair of adjacent digits is also even.
%C A282665 The sequence is started with a(1) = 0 and always extended with the smallest integer not yet present and not leading to a contradiction. If two successive digits are equal (e.g., 2,2) we accept that there is a "larger one" (2).
