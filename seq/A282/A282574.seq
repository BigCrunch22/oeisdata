%N A282574 The final position on a staircase of n steps during the following routine: Take steps of length 1 up a staircase until you can't step any further, then take steps of length 2 down until you can't step any further, and so on.
%C A282574 If a(n) = 0 or a(n) = n, then A282443(n) = n and n is in A282444.
%C A282574 a(n) is bounded above by A282443(n) and bounded below by n - A282443(n).

%e A282574 For n = 4:
%e A282574 step size 1: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 (four steps);
%e A282574 step size 2: 4 -> 2 -> 0 (two steps);
%e A282574 step size 3: 0 -> 3 (one step).
%e A282574 Because the walker cannot take four steps down, a(4) = 3 (the final position).
