%N A282024 Define k by A280864(k) = 2^n; then a(n) = A280864(k-1)/2, or -1 if that is not an integer.
%C A282024 It is known that every even number appears in A280864, and that the powers of 2 appear in increasing order.
%C A282024 If it were known that A280864(k-1) were always even, this would prove that A280864 contains every odd number, and so complete the proof that A280864 contains every positive number.
