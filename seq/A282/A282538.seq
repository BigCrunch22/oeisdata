%N A282538 Odd integers n with the property that the largest prime factor of n^2+4 is less than n.
%C A282538 Every Pythagorean prime p can be uniquely written as the sum of two positive integers a and b such that ab is congruent to 1 (mod p).  If a>b, then the difference a-b must be an odd number; no number on this list can be said difference, and every positive odd integer NOT on this list is the difference of exactly one pair.
%e A282538 Examples: 5 is not on this list, and 17-12=5 while 17+12=29 and (17)(12)==1 mod 29.  9 is not on this list, and 13-4=9 while 13+4=17 and (13)(4)==1 mod 17.  13 is not on this list, and 93-80=13 while 93+80=173 and (93)(80)==1 mod 173.  Note that 5^2+4=29, 9^2+4=85=17(5), and 13^2+4=173
