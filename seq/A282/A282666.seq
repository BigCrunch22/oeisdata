%N A282666 The larger term of the pair (a(n), a(n+1)) is always prime and the larger digit of any pair of adjacent digits is also prime.
%C A282666 The sequence is started with a(1) = 0 and always extended with the smallest integer not yet present and not leading to a contradiction.
%C A282666 If two successive digits are equal (e.g., 2,2) we accept that there is a "larger one" (2).
%C A282666 The digits "8" and "9" cannot be present in the sequence as no "prime digit" is larger than "8" or "9".
