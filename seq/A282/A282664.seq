%N A282664 The larger term of the pair (a(n), a(n+1)) is always odd and the larger digit of any pair of adjacent digits is also odd.
%C A282664 The sequence is started with a(1) = 0 and always extended with the smallest integer not yet present and not leading to a contradiction.
%C A282664 If two successive digits are equal (e.g., 3,3) we accept that there is a "larger one" (3).
