%N A282530 Number of finite FRUTE loops of order n up to isomorphism.
%C A282530 For a groupoid Q and x in Q, define the right (left) translation map R_x: Q->Q by yR_x=yx (L_x: Q->Q by yL_x=xy). A loop is a groupoid Q with neutral element 1 in which all translations are bijections in Q. A loop Q is called a FRUTE loop if it satisfies the identity (x.xy)z=(y.xz)x for all x, y, z in Q. The smallest associative non-commutative finite FRUTE loop is of order 8, the quaternion group having 8 elements.

%e A282530 a(8)=2 since there are 2 FRUTE loops of order 8, one of which is the quaternion group of order 8 and a(16)=6 since there are 6 FRUTE loops of order 16.
