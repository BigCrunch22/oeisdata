%N A282001 a(n) is the smallest prime p such that there is a multiplicative subgroup H of Z/pZ, of odd size and of index 2n, such that for any two cosets H1 and H2 of H, H1 + H2 contains all of (Z/pZ)\0.
%C A282001 The fact that H is of odd size means H is disjoint from -H. The finite integral relation algebra with n pairs of asymmetric flexible diversity atoms is representable over Z/pZ, where p = a(n).
