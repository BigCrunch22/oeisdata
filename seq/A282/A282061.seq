%N A282061 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct terms such that, for any prime p, any run of consecutive multiples of p has length exactly 2, and the terms in such a run have the same p-adic valuation.
%C A282061 This sequence is similar to A280864, with an additional constraint on the p-adic valuation of consecutive multiples of any prime p. However, the graphs of those two sequences are quite different.
