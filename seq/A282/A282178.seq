%N A282178 Primes for which the sum of all preceding odd-indexed prime gaps is exactly one greater than the sum of all preceding even-indexed prime gaps.
%C A282178 If the counting numbers 1, 2, 3, ... are written out sequentially such that one unit is moved in a given direction each time a new number is written and such that the direction is reversed if and only if a prime number is reached, these are the primes that lie directly below the number 1.
%C A282178 Comments from _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 21 2019: (Start)
%C A282178 Let p(k) = k-th prime, Delta p(k) = p(k+1)-p(k). The sequence contains those primes q such that
%C A282178   Sum_{k odd, p(k+1) <= q} Delta p(k) = 1 + Sum_{k even, p(k+1) <= q} Delta p(k).
%C A282178 The boustrophedon path described in the first comment can be drawn as follows (it is very similar to the path in A330339):

%C A282178 The primes that fall in column 0 make up the sequence.
%C A282178 Thanks to _Walter Trump_ for pointing out that this sequence is very similar to the Boustrophedon Primes sequence of A330339, and for correcting an omission in an earlier version of these comments.
%C A282178 The close relationship between the two sequences is demonstrated by the fact that the Boustrophedon Primes occur exactly when A330545 is 0, whereas the primes in the present sequence occur exactly when A330545 is 1 or 2.
%C A282178 Yet another way to relate the two sequences is to say that the present sequence gives all the primes > 2 in columns 1 and 2 of the triangle in A330339.
%C A282178 (End)
%C A282178 The primes (other than 2) occur only in even-numbered columns: primes congruent to 3 mod 4 occur in columns congruent to 0 mod 4, and primes congruent to 1 mod 4 occur in columns congruent to 2 mod 4. See the "Notes" link for proof. In particular, a(n) == 3 mod 4.- _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 04 2020
%C A282178 Frank Stevenson's data seems to suggest that a(n) is roughly growing like n^c where c is about 2.74. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 31 2019
