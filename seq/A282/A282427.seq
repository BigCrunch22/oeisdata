%N A282427 Numbers k such that A282442(k) = ceiling(k/2) + 1.
%C A282427 All terms are odd.
%C A282427 Proof: if A282442(2m) = m + 1, then the step of length m would have to have concluded on exactly the middle step, but a phase with step-length m cannot end on the middle step because the distance from the middle step to the top/bottom of the staircase is equal to m.
