%N A282712 Orbit of 23 under repeated applications of the map m -> A127202(m).
%C A282712 It is known that A127202 is a permutation of the positive integers. The orbit containing 23 appears to be the first infinite orbit. See A282713 for the orbit of 23 under the inverse permutation, and see A127202 for other orbits (there are several small cycles).
