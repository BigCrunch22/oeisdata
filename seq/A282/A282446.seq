%N A282446 Call d a recursive divisor of n iff the p-adic valuation of d is a recursive divisor of the p-adic valuation of n for any prime p dividing d; a(n) gives the number of recursive divisors of n.
%C A282446 More informally, the prime tower factorization of a recursive divisor of n can be obtained by removing branches from the prime tower factorization of n (the prime tower factorization of a number is defined in A182318).
%C A282446 A recursive divisor of n is also a divisor of n, hence a(n)<=A000005(n) for any n, with equality iff n is cubefree (i.e. n belongs to A004709).
%C A282446 A recursive divisor of n is also a (1+e)-divisor of n, hence a(n)<=A049599(n) for any n, with equality iff the p-adic valuation of n is cubefree for any prime p dividing n.
%C A282446 This sequence first differs from A049599 at n=256: a(256)=4 whereas A049599(256)=5; note that 256=2^(2^3), and 2^3 is not cubefree.

%F A282446 Multiplicative, with a(p^k)=1+a(k) for any prime p and k>0.
%F A282446 a(A014221(n))=n+1 for any n>=0.
%e A282446 The recursive divisors of 40 are: 1, 2, 5, 8, 10 and 40, hence a(40)=6.
