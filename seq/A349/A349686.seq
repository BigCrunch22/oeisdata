%N A349686 Numbers k such that the continued fraction of the abundancy index of k contains a single distinct element.
%C A349686 All the multiply-perfect numbers (A007691) are terms of this sequence, since the continued fraction of their abundancy index contains a single element.
%C A349686 Up to 4*10^10 the continued fractions of the abundancy indices of the terms have lengths 1, 2, 3, 5 or 11. The least terms that are corresponding to these lengths are 1, 24, 30, 348 and 1997868, respectively. Are there terms with other lengths?
%e A349686 24 is a term since the continued fraction of its abundancy index sigma(24)/24 = 5/2 = 2 + 1/2 has the elements {2, 2}.
%e A349686 30 is a term since the continued fraction of its abundancy index sigma(30)/30 = 12/5 = 2 + 1/(2 + 1/2) has the elements {2, 2, 2}.
%e A349686 143880 is a term since the continued fraction of its abundancy index sigma(143880)/143880 = 360/109 = 3 + 1/(3 + 1/(3 + 1/(3 + 1/3))) has the elements {3, 3, 3}.
