%N A349820 Primes p such that 2*p is a member of A230624.
%C A349820 It is not known if A230624 is infinite. Many of its initial terms are twice primes, so it would interesting if these primes could be characterized in some other way.
%C A349820 a(n)+1 typically has a slowly growing power of 2 as factor. as can be seen here: (PARI) for(k=1, #a, print1(valuation(a[k]+1,2),", ")): 1, 3, 2, 2, 5, 4, 4, 3, 6, 4, 7, 5, 5, 5, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 10, 9, 8, 9, 8, 8, 9, 9, 12, 11, 11, 10, 10, 11, 10, 17, 11, 11, 12, 12,.. - _Hugo Pfoertner_ Jan 03 2022
