%N A349366 Number of primes p such that prime(n) < p <= prime(n) + (log(prime(n)))^2 - log(prime(n)) - 1.
%C A349366 This sequence is an example of the search for an elementary upper bound for prime gaps that is valid for all but finitely many cases. A182134 is motivated by Firoozbakht's conjecture. Kourbatov's paper proves that Firoozbakht's conjecture is equivalent to an upper bound on prime gaps of the form (log(p))^2 - log(p) - b, where 1 <= b <= 1.17. This sequence results from the choice b = 1. While Kourbatov's bound with b = 1 implies Firoozbakht's conjecture, the terms of this sequence appear to be smaller than A182134.
%C A349366 Conjectures: prime gaps are o((log(p))^2), but are larger infinitely often than (log(p))^(2 - epsilon), for any epsilon > 0.

%e A349366 a(12) is the number of primes above prime(12), which is 37, in a gap whose width is (log(37))^2 + log(37) - 1 = 8.4278: that is, the number of primes between 37 and 45.4278, and that is 2 (namely, 41 and 43).
