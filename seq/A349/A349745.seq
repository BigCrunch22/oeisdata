%N A349745 Numbers k for which k * gcd(sigma(k), A003961(k)) is equal to sigma(k) * gcd(k, A003961(k)), where A003961 shifts the prime factorization one step towards larger primes, and sigma is the sum of divisors function.
%C A349745 Numbers k for which k * A342671(k) = A000203(k) * A322361(k).
%C A349745 Numbers k such that gcd(A064987(k), A191002(k)) = gcd(A064987(k), A341529(k)).
%C A349745 Obviously, all odd terms in this sequence must be squares.
%C A349745 All the terms k of A005820 that satisfy A007949(k) < A007814(k) [i.e., whose 3-adic valuation is strictly less than their 2-adic valuation] are also terms of this sequence. Incidentally, the first six known terms of A005820 satisfy this condition, while on the other hand, any hypothetical odd 3-perfect number would be excluded from this sequence. Also, as a corollary, any hypothetical 3-perfect numbers of the form 4u+2 must not be multiples of 3 if they are to appear here. Similarly for any k which occurs in A349169, for 2*k to occur in this sequence, it shouldn't be a multiple of 3 and k should also be a term of A191218. See question 2 and its partial answer in A349169.
%C A349745 From _Antti Karttunen_, Feb 13-20 2022: (Start)
%C A349745 Question: Are all terms/2 (A351548) abundant, from n > 1 onward?
%C A349745 Note that of the 65 known 5-multiperfect numbers, all others except these three 1245087725796543283200, 1940351499647188992000, 4010059765937523916800 are also included in this sequence. The three exceptions are distinguished by the fact that their 3 and 5-adic valuations are equal. In 62 others the former is larger.
%C A349745 If k satisfying the condition were of the form 4u+2, then it should be one of the terms of A191218 doubled as only then both k and sigma(k) are of the form 4u+2, with equal 2-adic valuations for both. More precisely, one of the terms of A351538.
