%N A349474 a(n) is the length of the continued fraction of the harmonic mean of the divisors of n.
%C A349474 a(n) = 1 if and only if n is a harmonic number (A001599).
%C A349474 a(n) <= 2 if and only if n is in A348865.

%e A349474 a(1) = 1 since the harmonic mean of the divisors of 1 is 1 and its continued fraction has 1 element, {1}.
%e A349474 a(2) = 2 since the harmonic mean of the divisors of 2 is 4/3 = 1 + 1/3 and its continued fraction has 2 elements, {1, 3}.
%e A349474 a(4) = 4 since the harmonic mean of the divisors of 4 is 12/7 = 1 + 1/(1 + 1/(2 + 1/2)) and its continued fraction has 4 elements, {1, 1, 2, 2}.
