%N A349822 Irregular triangle T(n,b) (n >= 3, 2 <= b <= A230624(n)/2+1) read by rows. Let m = A230624(n). Then T(n,b) is the smallest nonnegative number k such that k+S_b(k)=m, where S_b(k) is the sum of the digits of k in base b.
%C A349822 T(n,b) must be nonzero for all b >= 2, and so this triangle is actually the upper left corner of an array with infinitely long rows (it is believed that there are also infinitely many rows).
%C A349822 Since T(n,b) = m/2 for all b > m/2, we may truncate row n after m/2 terms. The rows do not change beyond that point.
%e A349822 Triangle begins as follows:

%e A349822 For n = 3, m = A230624(3) = 10, and row 3 of the triangle is [7, 7, 8, 7, 5], corresponding to the identities (where x_b is the base-b expansion of x):
%e A349822    10 = 111_2 + 3 = 7 + 3,
%e A349822       = 21_3 + 3 = 7 + 3
%e A349822       = 20_4 + 2 = 8 + 2
%e A349822       = 12_5 + 3 = 7 + 3
%e A349822       = 5_b + 5  = 5 + 5 for all b >= 6.
