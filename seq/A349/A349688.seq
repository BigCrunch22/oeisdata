%N A349688 Numbers k such that the sequence of elements of the continued fraction of the abundancy index of k is palindromic.
%C A349688 All the multiply-perfect numbers (A007691) are terms of this sequence, since the continued fraction of their abundancy index contains a single element.

%e A349688 24 is a term since the sequence of elements of the abundancy index of 24, sigma(24)/24 = 5/2 = 2 + 1/2, is {2, 2}, which is palindromic.
%e A349688 42 is a term since the sequence of elements of the abundancy index of 42, sigma(42)/42 = 16/7 = 2 + 1/(3 + 1/2), is {2, 3, 2}, which is palindromic.
