%N A349690 Numbers k such that the continued fraction of the abundancy index of k contains distinct elements.
%C A349690 All the primes (A000040) are terms of this sequence, since the continued fraction of the abundancy index of a prime p is {1, p}.
%C A349690 All the multiply-perfect numbers (A007691) are terms of this sequence, since the continued fraction of their abundancy index contains a single element.

%e A349690 2 is a term since the abundancy index of 2 is 3/2 = 1 + 1/2 and the elements of the continued fraction, {1, 2}, are different.
%e A349690 4 is not a term since the abundancy index of 4 is 7/4 = 1 + 1/(1 + 1/3) and the elements of the continued fraction, {1, 1, 3}, are not distinct.
