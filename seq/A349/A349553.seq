%N A349553 a(n) is the least k such that some halving partition of n has exactly k parts.
%C A349553 Let S(m) = {f(m/2)), c(m/2) : m >= 1}, where f = floor and c = ceiling. A halving partition of n is a partition p(1) + p(2) + ... + p(k) of n such that p(1) is in S(n) and p(i) is in S(p(i-1)) for i = 1, 2, ..., k .  The basic idea is that each term after the first is about half of the preceding term. (See A349552.)
%e A349553 Let f = floor and c = ceiling.
%e A349553 a(1) counts this partition: c(1/2) = 1.
%e A349553 a(2) = 5 counts these partitions:
%e A349553 c(5/2) + c(3/2) = 5;
%e A349553 c(5/2) + f(3/2) + c(1/2) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.
%e A349553 a(3) = 11 counts these partitions:
%e A349553 c(11/2) + f(6/2) + c(3/2) = 6 + 3 + 2 = 11;
%e A349553 c(11/2) + f(6/2) + f(3/2) + c(1/2) = 6 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 11;
%e A349553 f(11/2) + c(5/2) + c(3/2) + f(2/2) = 5 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 11.
%e A349553 a(4) = 19 counts these partitions:
%e A349553 c(19/2) + f(10/2) + c(5/2) + f(3/2) = 10 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 19;
%e A349553 c(19/2) + f(10/2) + f(5/2) + f(2/2) + c(1/2) = 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 19;
%e A349553 f(19/2) + c(9/2) + c(5/2) + c(3/2) = 9 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 19;  f(19/2) + c(9/2) + c(5/2) + f(3/2) + c(1/2) = 9 + 5 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 19.
