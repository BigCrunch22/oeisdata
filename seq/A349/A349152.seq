%N A349152 Standard composition numbers of compositions into divisors. Numbers k such that all parts of the k-th composition in standard order are divisors of the sum of parts.
%C A349152 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%e A349152 The terms and corresponding compositions begin:
