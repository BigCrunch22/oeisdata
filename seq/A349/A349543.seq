%C A349543 Although terms k in A277272 are distinct, terms m in this sequence may appear A000607(m) times, even consecutively.
%C A349543 The restriction of the number of appearances of m to A000607(m) is a consequence of distinct k such that A001414(k) = m. Distinct k for which A001414(k) = m relates to the number of prime partitions of m and are listed in row m of A064364. For example, k in {7, 10, 12} have A001414(k) = 7. Once these k have appeared in A277272, there is no other way to obtain m = 7 in this sequence. Hence m = 7 is exhausted in this sequence.
%C A349543 Terms are greater than 1.
