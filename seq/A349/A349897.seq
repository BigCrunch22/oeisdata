%N A349897 Start with b(0)=4. a(n) is the smallest integer such that b(n)=a(n)*b(n-1) has twice as many divisors as b(n-1) has.
%C A349897 If b(0)=4 is replaced by b(0)=1 we get numbers of the form p^(2^k) where p is prime; that is, A050376. The number of divisors of 4*the n-th partial product of sequence terms is 3*2^n.
%C A349897 Conjecture: a composite number is in this sequence if and only if it is the product of 2 consecutive terms of A050376.
%e A349897 4 has 3 divisors. a(1) must be a number by which you can multiply 4 to get a number with 3*2=6 divisors. It can't be 2 because 4*2=8 has 4 divisors. It can be 3 because 4*3=12 has 6 divisors.
