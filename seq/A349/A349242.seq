%N A349242 Numbers N = pqrs such that |pqr - s| < |ps - qr|, where p <= q <= r <= s are the 4 prime factors of N.
%C A349242 The set A014613 of numbers n with bigomega(n) = A001222(n) = 4, can be partitioned in these here (of "cis" type), and their complement A349241, those of "trans" type; see the math-fun post in LINKS for this suggested terminology.
%C A349242 Within the 4-almost primes below 10^k, k = 2, 3, ...,8, we have (92, 1215, 13784, 148834, 1559299, 16089405, ...) of cis type, more than twice as much as those of trans type.

%F A349242 { N in A014613 | |g - N/g| < |sg - N/sg| }, where g = gpf(N) = A006530(N) is the greatest, and s = spf(N) = A020639(N) is the smallest prime factor.
%e A349242 The first three 4-almost primes 16 = 2^4, 24 = 2^3*3 and 36 = 2^2*3^2 are not in this sequence, because the factorization u*v with closest possible factors u and v consists of choosing both, u and v, to be semiprimes (namely, 4*4, 4*6 and 6*6).
%e A349242 The 4-almost prime 40 = 2^3*5 is in this sequence because the factorization 40 = u*v with u = 2^3, v = 5 has closer factors (distance 8 - 5 = 3) than u = 2*2, v = 2*5 (distance 10 - 4 = 6).
