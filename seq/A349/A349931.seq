%N A349931 Numbers that have an equal number of factorizations of even and odd length in both unordered and ordered manners.
%C A349931 Intersection of A319240 and A013929, i.e., terms of A319240 that are not squarefree.
%C A349931 A319240 lists the numbers that have an equal number of factorizations of even and odd length in an unordered manner.
%C A349931 A013929 lists the numbers that have an equal number of factorizations of even and odd length in an ordered manner.
%C A349931 There are infinitely many terms in this sequence since p^2 is always such a number for prime p.
%C A349931 Out of all numbers of the form p^k with p prime (listed in A000961), only the numbers of the form p^2 (A001248) are terms.
%C A349931 Out of all numbers of the form p*q^k, p and q prime, only the numbers of the form p*q (A006881), p*q^2 (A054753), p*q^4 (A178739) and p*q^6 (A189987) are terms.
%C A349931 Similar methods can be applied to all prime signatures.
%C A349931 Wilf's conjecture is equivalent to the statement that this sequence is the set difference of A319240 and A006881.
