%N A349990 For any n >= 0, consider a sandpile model on the infinite square lattice starting with n grains at the origin, the other sites being empty; a(n) gives the number of nonempty sites after stabilization of this sandpile model.
%C A349990 A site is unstable when it holds 4 or more grains.
%C A349990 As long as there is an unstable site:
%C A349990 - choose such an unstable site,
%C A349990 - remove 4 grains from this site and add 1 grain to each of its four neighbors.
%C A349990 This procedure is guaranteed to result in a stable configuration, which does not depend on the order in which we treat the unstable sites.

%F A349990 a(4*n) + 1 = a(4*n+1) = a(4*n+2) = a(4*n+3).
%e A349990 For n = 25:
%e A349990 - after stabilization, we have the following configuration:
%e A349990          1
%e A349990        2 3 2
%e A349990      1 3 1 3 1
%e A349990        2 3 2
%e A349990          1
%e A349990 - there are 13 nonempty sites,
%e A349990 - so a(25) = 13.
