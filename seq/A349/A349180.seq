%N A349180 Coreful harmonic numbers: nonsquarefree numbers k such that the harmonic mean of the coreful divisors of k is an integer.
%C A349180 A divisor of a number k is coreful if it is divisible by every prime that divides k.
%C A349180 The sequence is restricted to nonsquarefree numbers since the squarefree numbers have a single coreful divisor and thus they trivially have an integer harmonic mean.
