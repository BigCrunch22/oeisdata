%N A349765 Numbers k which cannot be expressed as the sum of two positive integers k = a + b with a < b so that the continued fraction for a/b has all its partial quotients equal to 1 or 2.

%e A349765 For k = 4, k = 1 + 3. The only continued fraction is 1/3 = [0; 3] and 4 is a term.
%e A349765 For k = 5 we have k = 1 + 4 and k = 2 + 3. The continued fractions are 1/4 = [0;4] and 2/3 = [0; 1, 2]. So, 5 is not a term.
%e A349765 For k = 17, 5/12 = [0; 2, 2, 2]. So, 17 is not a term.
