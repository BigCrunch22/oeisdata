%N A349245 Minimal sequence of single-tile sliding moves that progressively transpose elements 0 through k (k = 1, 2, 3, ...) of the infinite square matrix, cf. comments for details.
%C A349245 Consider the infinite square matrix filled with the nonnegative integers by falling antidiagonals (cf. A001477 displayed as table / square array),
%C A349245    0  1  3  6 ...
%C A349245    2  4  7 11 ...
%C A349245    5  8 12 17 ...
%C A349245   ...
%C A349245 Similar to the moves in the well-known sliding puzzle, "move m" consists in shifting one place towards "empty tile" 0 all nonzero elements between 0 and the nonzero number m in the same row or column as 0, and moving 0 in the former location of m, cf. EXAMPLE. If m is an immediate neighbor of 0 (so m and 0 simply exchange their places) this is a single-tile move, else a multi-tile move.
%C A349245 The target configuration is the transposed matrix, cf. A061579 read as table / square array. More precisely, we call goal [k] any infinite matrix where all of {0, ..., k}, are in the same position as in the transposed matrix. The position of numbers > k is irrelevant.
%C A349245 This sequence gives the shortest (and in case of a tie, the lexicographically earliest) sequence of single-tile moves that successively achieve goal [1], then [2], then [3], etc. It can be considered as an irregular table where row k gives the moves needed to go from goal [k-1] to goal [k]. See EXAMPLE for details.
%C A349245 It is interesting to note that goal [2] cannot be achieved without using a tile outside the upper left 2 X 2 square, and goal [5] can't be achieved within the 3 X 3 square. Goal [9] can be achieved within the 4 X 4 square, with moves (2, 5, 11, 9, 8, 11, 5, 4, 7, 18, 11, 8, 17, 11, 18, 7, 4, 2), but the minimal solution (row 9, see EXAMPLE) requires using row 5.
%C A349245 There are several variants of this sequence, mainly by achieving different goals and/or considering multi-tile moves. See A349244 for successive goals [1], [2], [3], .... One can also consider goals (k) where only the position of {1, ..., k} must be as given. Then goal (2) is achieved through moves (1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2).

%e A349245 Starting from the initial configuration (cf. comments), the first possible move "1" means to slide the 1 from row 1, column 2 to the "empty square" 0 at (1,1); then move "4" slides the 4 one up, and move "2" slides the 2 to the right:
%e A349245    0  1  3 ...   (1)   1  0  3 ...   (4)   1  4  3 ...   (2)   1  4  3 ...
%e A349245    2  4  7 ...   ==>   2  4  7 ...   ==>   2  0  7 ...   ==>   0  2  7 ...
%e A349245    ... ... ...         ... ... ...         ... ... ...         ... ... ...
%e A349245 The next move, 1, will place that tile in its final position (row 2, column 1):
%e A349245    (1)   0  4  3 ...
%e A349245    ==>   1  2  7 ...
%e A349245          ... ... ...
%e A349245 Given that the 0 is also in its final position (1,1), this achieves what we call goal [1]. Now further moves 4 and 2 would move the 2 in its final position (1,2), so {1, 2} are in their final position, but 0 isn't. (This is called goal (2) in comments.)
%e A349245 However, to achieve goal [2] with also 0 in its initial position (row 1, column 1), in a minimum number of moves, one has to proceed differently: see a(4..18).
%e A349245 Formatted as an irregular table with rows ending with achieved goals [1], [2], [3], ... the sequence reads:
%e A349245 row 1: [1, 4, 2, 1]   \\ here {0, 1} are at their final position
%e A349245 row 2: [4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 3, 7, 12, 8, 5, 4, 1, 3, 2] \\ here {0, 1, 2} are "done"
%e A349245 row 3: [1, 3, 5, 4, 3, 1] \\ here {0, 1, 2, 3} are in their final position
%e A349245 row 4: [2, 5, 4, 8, 12, 7, 5, 2] \\ now {0, ..., 4} are in their final position
%e A349245 row 5: [1, 3, 8, 13, 9, 8, 3, 1] \\ now {0, ..., 5} are in their final position
%e A349245 row 6: [2, 5, 6, 11, 7, 6, 5, 2, 1, 4, 6, 12, 13, 6, 4, 3, 6, 9, 8, 6, 3, 1]
%e A349245 row 7: [2, 4, 12, 7, 17, 13, 7, 12, 9, 7, 12, 9, 4, 2]
%e A349245 row 8: [1, 3, 7, 8, 18, 12, 8, 18, 12, 24, 13, 17, 9, 8, 18, 7, 3, 1]
%e A349245 row 9: [2, 4, 8, 18, 17, 23, 16, 10, 11, 9, 18, 8, 4, 2]
