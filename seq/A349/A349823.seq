%N A349823 First differences of A230624.
%C A349823 This sequence could certainly be divided by 2, just as we divided A230624 itself by 2 to get A349821. But there is a reason for not dividing this by 2: it appears that, for any power of 2, from a certain point on, the sequence is divisible by that power of 2. At present this only a conjecture. But it may provide a clue to the structure of this sequence and therefore of A230624.
%C A349823 For example, after 14 terms, the present sequence (as far as it is presently known) can be divided by 64, giving 3, 1, 8, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6, 1, 5, 4, 5, 6, 12, 6, 4, 6, 2, 14, 32, 8, 2, 2, 20, 32, 4, 4, 20, 62, 60, 36, 284, 48, 424, 440, 40, 136, 16, 200, 48, 96, 40, ..., which in turn can be divided by 2 after a further 14 terms.
%C A349823 So there is at least some structure here.
