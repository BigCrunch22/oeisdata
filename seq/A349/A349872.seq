%N A349872 a(1) = 2; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest unused number > 1 such that none of the previous a(n) terms divide a(n).
%C A349872 Slightly under two-thirds of the terms are between the lines a(n) = n/2 and a(n) = n; in the range studied all of these numbers are composite. The remaining terms, all of which are primes, lie approximately on a curve that starts with a slope near 2 that slowly increases. See the linked image.
%C A349872 There are no fixed points up to 10000 terms so it is likely none exist.
%C A349872 For many even terms a(n) where n > a(n) it is found that a(n - a(n) - 1) = a(n)/2. The first even term where that is not the case is a(113) = 68, as a(113 - 68 - 1) = a(44) = 97, not 34. In this case a(43) = 34.
%C A349872 For a given number k the longest possible sequence of unique numbers that contains a number every k terms that divides k is finite, ~ 2*sqrt(k)*k; this implies all numbers > 1 eventually appear.

%F A349872 a(2) = 3 as the previous term 2 does not divide 3.
