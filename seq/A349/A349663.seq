%N A349663 Positive numbers x for which x^2 can be expressed as z^2 - y^4 with y != 0.
%C A349663 This sequence is closely related to A271576.
%C A349663 Conditions to be satisfied for a solution:
%C A349663 - z cannot be a square.
%C A349663 - z must have at least one prime factor of the form p == 1 (mod 4), a Pythagorean prime (A002144).
%C A349663 - If z has prime factors of the form p == 3 (mod 4), which are in A002145, then they must appear in the prime divisor sets of x and y too.
%C A349663 - If z is even, x and y must be even too.
%C A349663 - The lower limit of the ratio x/y is sqrt(2).
%C A349663 Multiple solutions are possible; e.g., term 420 has 5 solutions.
%e A349663 The 5 solutions corresponding to a(54) = 420 are 420^2 = 176400 = 444^2 - 12^4 = 580^2 - 20^4 = 609^2 - 21^4 = 1295^2 - 35^4 = 3164^2 - 56^4.
%Y A349663 Cf. A000290, A000583, A271576, A002144, A002145.
