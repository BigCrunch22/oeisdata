%N A349953 a(1)=0 and thereafter a(n) = Min a(i) over those i=1..n-2 with i + a(i+1) = n; or if no such i then a(n) is the least integer >= 2 not in a(1)..a(n-1).
%C A349953 The idea is that a value a(i) may repeat at a distance a(i+1) ahead of i, which is location n = i + a(i+1).
%C A349953 A given location n might have multiple such candidate a(i), in which case the smallest a(i) is taken.
%C A349953 A given location n might have no candidate a(i), and those are filled by successive integers >= 2.
%C A349953 Once a(n) has been determined, it becomes a distance ahead for use with a(n-1).  One way to calculate the sequence is to keep track of the smallest candidate at locations ahead, and apply each a(n-1) into them as each a(n) is determined.
%C A349953 A given term repeats in a kind of chain of locations.  If that chain is broken because the term was not the smallest candidate, then it never occurs again.
%C A349953 0 occurs infinitely since it is always the smallest candidate.
%C A349953 Any number followed by 0 does not reappear, since its candidate location is only its own i + 0 = i.
%C A349953 This sequence was inspired by Van Eck's sequence (A181391). The question there "Have I seen this before?" changes to here "Will I see this again?", and we count the places forward instead of backward.

%e A349953 a(6) = 0 because a(3) = 0 reappeared 3 places further on in the sequence, as a(4) = 3 has determined this.
%e A349953 a(7) = 5 because no candidate repeating number was determined for this place by any previous term, and 5 is the least integer >= 2 among those not already in the sequence.
%e A349953 For a(14), a(9) = 6 made a(8) = 3, and a(10) = 5 made a(9) = 6 as candidate repeated numbers. Of these, a(8) = 3 is the lesser one, therefore a(14) = 3.
