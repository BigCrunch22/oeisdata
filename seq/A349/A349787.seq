%N A349787 Number of ways to write n as x^2 + y^k + 2^a + 2^b, where x,y,a,b are nonnegative integers with x >= y and a >= b, and k is either 2 or 3.
%C A349787 Conjecture 1: a(n) > 0 for all n >= 2.
%C A349787 Below is our weaker version of Conjecture 1.
%C A349787 Conjecture 2: Each n = 2,3,... can be written as a sum of two perfect powers (including 0 and 1) and two powers of 2 (including 2^0 = 1).
%C A349787 In contrast, R. Crocker proved in 2008 that there are infinitely many positive integers which cannot be written as a sum of two squares and two powers of 2.
