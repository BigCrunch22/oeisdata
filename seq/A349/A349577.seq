%N A349577 Decimal expansion of the volume of the solid formed by the intersection of 4 right circular unit-diameter cylinders whose axes pass through the diagonals of a cube.
%C A349577 Equivalently, the axes of the cylinders can be placed along the lines joining the vertices of a regular tetrahedron with the centers of the faces on the opposite sides.
%C A349577 This constant was first calculated by Moore (1974).
%C A349577 The corresponding volumes in the analogous cases of 2 and 3 mutually orthogonal cylinders are 2/3 (A010722) and 2 - sqrt(2) (A101465), respectively.
