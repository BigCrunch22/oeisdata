%N A349985 Primes of the form (product of 4 consecutive primes) + (sum of the same 4 consecutive primes).
%C A349985 It is conjectured that this sequence is infinite, and that similar lists of primes can be generated by using any even number of consecutive primes.  Specifying 2 consecutive primes results in A096342.  However, it should be noted that the percentage of resulting primes (as compared to all numbers generated in this manner) decreases as the number of consecutive primes to consider increases.
