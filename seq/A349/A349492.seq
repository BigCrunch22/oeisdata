%N A349492 a(1)=1, a(2)=6; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number such that gcd(a(n-1)+n, a(n)) > 1, gcd(a(n-1), a(n)) > 1, and gcd(n, a(n)) > 1.
%C A349492 The majority of terms lie near a line of gradient 1, but some terms show extremely large jumps in value, e.g., in the first 30000 terms the largest value is a(25391) = 87893333254. It is likely all numbers eventually appear although this is unknown. In the same range, and other than a(3) = 3, there are twenty-one fixed points all between 626 to 856 inclusive. As the terms for n>30000 appear both above and below the line y = n it is possible more exist although this is unknown.
