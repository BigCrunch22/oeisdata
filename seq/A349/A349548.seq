%C A349548 From _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Nov 30 2021: (Start)
%C A349548 In A348575, row 30 begins with 167 == 5 (mod 9), so T(30, k) = 167 + A000217(k-1), hence a number whose digit sum is congruent to 2, 5, 6, or 8 (mod 9). After the first several terms of row 30, the smallest digit sums that have not yet appeared are 160, 169, 208, 214, 216, 219, 224, 226, 237, and 240; among those, the only ones congruent to 2, 5, 6, or 8 (mod 9) are 224 and 240, so it seems nearly certain that row 30 will end with the first term of A348575 whose digit sum is 224.
%C A349548 The smallest number whose digit sum is 224 is 8999999999999999999999999 = 9*10^24 - 1, so row 30 will have at least 4242640687120 terms. (The smallest number of the form 167 + A000217(k-1) whose digit sum is 224 seems likely to be a few orders of magnitude larger than 9*10^24.) (End)
%e A349548 When A348575 is written as an irregular triangle, the first three rows start as:
%e A349548    1,  2,  4, ...
