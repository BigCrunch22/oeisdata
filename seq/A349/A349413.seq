%N A349413 Number of smooth positroid varieties corresponding to derangements in S_n.
%C A349413 a(n) is also the number of derangements in S_n whose chordal diagram contains no crossed alignments.
%C A349413 a(n) is also the number of derangements in S_n whose chordal diagram is a separable union of star graphs, where a star graph is the chordal diagram of a permutation in S_m of the form w(i) = i + t (mod m) for some t.
%C A349413 a(n) counts the complement of A349456 in the set of all derangements of S_n (A000166).
%C A349413 a(n) appears to be the number of n-edge ordered trees in which each nonleaf has at least two children and each leftmost child has a designated favorite sibling. For example, for n = 3, the underlying tree must be a root with 3 children and there are two choices for the favorite sibling, so a(3) = 2. The generating function for these trees, A(x) = 1 + x^2 + 2*x^3 + 5*x^4 + ..., is easily shown, using the "symbolic method" of Flajolet and Sedgewick, to satisfy A(x) = 1 + x^2*A(x)^2/(1 - x*A(x))^2. - _David Callan_, May 15 2022
