%N A349222 Numbers k such that k and k+1 have the same average of unitary divisors.
%C A349222 The average of the unitary divisors of k is equal to A034448(k)/A034444(k).
%C A349222 Terms k such that k and k+1 are squarefree are also terms of A238380. The terms that are not in A238380 are 44, 55, 152, 1652, 2204, 2232, 2295, 3195, 4256, ...
%C A349222 The average is an integer for the first 1000 terms. Are there terms with a noninteger average?

%e A349222 5 is a term since the average of the unitary divisors of 5 is (1 + 5)/2 = 3, and the average of the unitary divisors of 6 is (1 + 2 + 3 + 6)/4 = 3.
%e A349222 44 is a term since the average of the unitary divisors of 44 is (1 + 4 + 11 + 44)/4 = 15, and the average of the unitary divisors of 45 is (1 + 5 + 9 + 45)/4 = 15.
