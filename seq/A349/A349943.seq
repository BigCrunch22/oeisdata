%N A349943 Number of ways to write n as a^4 + (b^4 + c^2 + d^2)/9, where a,b,c,d are nonnegative integers with c <= d.
%C A349943 Conjecture 1: a(n) > 0 for all n >= 0, and a(n) = 1 only for n = 0, 16^k*m (k = 0,1,2,... and m = 7, 8, 31, 39, 47, 79, 519).
%C A349943 This implies that each nonnegative rational number can be written as x^4 + 9*y^4 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w rational numbers.
%C A349943 Conjecture 2: Each n = 0,1,2,... can be written as a^4 + (4*b^4 + c^2 + d^2)/81 with a,b,c,d nonnegative integers.
%C A349943 This implies that each nonnegative rational number can be written as x^4 + 4*y^4 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w rational numbers.
%C A349943 We have verified Conjectures 1 and 2 for n <= 10^5.
%C A349943 It seems that each n = 0,1,2,... can be written as a^4 + (b^4 + c^2 + d^2)/m^2 with a,b,c,d nonnegative integers, provided that m is among the odd numbers 7, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, ....
