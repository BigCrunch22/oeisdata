%N A349552 a(n) is the number of halving partitions of n (see Comments for definition).
%C A349552 Let S(m) = {f(m/2)), c(m/2) : m >= 1}, where f = floor and c = ceiling. A halving partition of n is a partition p(1) + p(2) + ... + p(k) of n such that p(1) is in S(n) and p(i) is in S(p(i-1)) for i = 1, 2, ..., k.  The basic idea is that each term after the first is about half of the preceding term.
%e A349552 a(9) counts these 2 partitions:
%e A349552 c(9/2) + f(5/2) + f(2/2} + c(1/2) = 5 + 3 + 1;
%e A349552 f(9/2) + f(5/2) + f(2/2) + c(1/2) = 4 + 2 + 1 + 1.
%e A349552 a(13) counts these:
%e A349552 c(13/2) + c(7/2) + f(4/2) = 7 + 4 + 2;
%e A349552 c(13/2) + f(7/2) + c(3/2) + f(2/2) = 7 + 3 + 2 + 1;
%e A349552 f(13/2) + f(6/2) + c(3/2) + f(2/2) + c(1/2) = 6 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1.
