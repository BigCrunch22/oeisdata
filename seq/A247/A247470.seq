%N A247470 Number of weak peaks in all weighted lattice paths in B(n).
%C A247470 B(n) is the set of lattice paths of weight n that start in (0,0), end on the horizontal axis and never go below this axis, whose steps are of the following four kinds: h = (1,0) of weight 1, H = (1,0) of weight 2, u = (1,1) of weight 2, and d = (1,-1)  of weight 1. The weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its steps.
%C A247470 A weak peak in a lattice path is a vertex on the top of a hump. A hump is an upstep followed by 0 or more flatsteps followed by a downstep. For example, the weighted lattice path Hu*duu*h*H*dd has 4 weak peaks (shown by the stars).
%C A247470 a(n) = Sum(k*A247469(n,k), k>=0).

%F A247470 G.f. G = z^3*g/((1 - z - z^2)^2*(1 - z - z^2 - 2*z^3*g)), where g = 1 + z*g + z^2*g + z^3*g^2.
%e A247470 a(4) = 4  because B(4) = {hhhh, hhH, hHh, Hhh, HH, hu*d, u*h*d, u*dh} (weak peaks shown by *).
