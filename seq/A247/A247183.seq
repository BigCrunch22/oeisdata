%N A247183 Numbers n such that the largest n-digit odd number concatenated with the smallest n-digit odd number is prime.
%C A247183 Numbers n such that 10^n-1 concatenated with 10^(n-1)+1 is prime.
%C A247183 a(8) > 10^4.
%e A247183 The largest and smallest odd 3-digit numbers are 999 and 101, respectively. Since 999101 is prime, 3 is a member of the sequence.
%e A247183 The largest and smallest odd 4-digit numbers are 9999 and 1001, respectively. Since 99991001 is not prime, 4 is not a member of this sequence.
%o A247183 (PARI) f(n) = 10^(n-1)*(10^(n+1)-9)+1
