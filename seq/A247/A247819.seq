%N A247819 Integers such that A247552(n) is not a repunit.
%C A247819 A247552(n) is the least number x such that the ratio of the sum of all the cyclic permutations of x, plus the unpermuted number, and x itself is equal to n.
%C A247819 When x is in the sequence, then all multiples of x are there too. The primitive terms, i.e., the terms that are not a multiple of a previous term, are 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 37, 41, 43, 47, 48, 53, 59, 61, 62, ... Among those, one finds few composites: 48, 62, 93, 180, 675, 961, ...
