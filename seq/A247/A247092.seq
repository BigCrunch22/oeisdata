%N A247092 Limiting sequence obtained by taking the sequence of Mersenne numbers 2^n-1, n=1,2,...(A000225) and applying an infinite process which is described in the comments.
%C A247092 Write the Mersenne numbers 2^n-1, n=1,2,..., in binary in form of triangle T_0(M) consisting of all 1's:
%C A247092 1
%C A247092 11
%C A247092 111
%C A247092 1111
%C A247092 11111
%C A247092 ......
%C A247092 Let the operator A_k map every k-th entry to its binary opposite (1->0, 0->1), for k=2,3,... . Put T_inf(M) = ...*A_4*A_3*A_2(T_(0)M), with successive applications of the operators A_2, A_3, A_4, ...
%C A247092 Note that the (0,1)-triangle T_inf(M) is well-defined, since the operator T_n does not affect entries in the first floor((sqrt(8*n-7) - 1)/2) rows.
%C A247092 The sequence lists numbers obtained by reading rows of T_inf(M) in binary and converting them to decimal.
%C A247092 The n-th entry t_n of T_inf(M) equals 1, if n is perfect square, and 0 otherwise (A010052, for n>=1).
%C A247092 Indeed, in order to get an entry t_n of T_inf(M), we should use all considered operators A_d, d|n, d>1. The number of these operators is the diminished on 1 the number of divisors of n which is even iff n is a perfect square. Thus only in this case we obtain that entry in the n-th position is flipped, beginning with 1, an even number of times, such that t_n=1, while, if n is nonsquare, t_n=0.
%C A247092 Note that, since (n+1)^2 - n^2 > n, then in every row of T_inf(M) there exists at most one 1. So every term is either 0 or a power of 2.

%F A247092 If there is an integer x in [sqrt((n-1)*n/2 +1), sqrt(n*(n+1)/2)] then it is unique and a(n) = 2^(n(n+1)/2-x^2); otherwise, a(n)=0.
%F A247092 Thus there are n/sqrt(2) + O(1) positive terms among the first n.
