%N A247250 Indices of Pell numbers having exactly one primitive prime factor.
%C A247250 Conjecture: The n-th Pell number A000129(n) has a primitive prime factor for all n > 1. (The n-th Fibonacci number A000045(n) has a primitive prime factor for all n except n = 0, 1, 2, 6, and 12.)
%C A247250 For prime p, all prime factors of Pell(p) are primitive. Hence the only primes in this sequence are the prime numbers in A096650, which gives the indices of prime Pell numbers.
%e A247250 Pell(1) = 1, which has no prime factors, so 1 is not in this sequence.
%e A247250 Pell(4) = 12 = 2^2 * 3, but 2 is not a primitive prime factor, and 3 is the only primitive prime factor of Pell(4), so 4 is in this sequence.
%e A247250 Pell(5) = 29, which is a prime and the only primitive prime factor of itself, so 5 is in this sequence.
%e A247250 Pell(12) = 13860 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5 * 7 * 11, but none of 2, 3, 5, 7 is a primitive prime factor, and 11 is the only primitive prime factor of Pell(12), so 12 is in this sequence.
%e A247250 Pell(14) = 80782 = 2 * 13^2 * 239, but neither 2 nor 13 is a primitive prime factor, and 239 is the only primitive prime factor of Pell(14), so 14 is in this sequence.
%e A247250 Pell(19) = 6625109 = 37 * 179057, both of which are primitive prime factors of Pell(19), so 19 is not in this sequence.
