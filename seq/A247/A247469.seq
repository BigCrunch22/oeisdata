%N A247469 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of weighted lattice paths B(n) having k weak peaks.
%C A247469 B(n) is the set of lattice paths of weight n that start in (0,0), end on the horizontal axis and never go below this axis, whose steps are of the following four kinds: h = (1,0) of weight 1, H = (1,0) of weight 2, u = (1,1) of weight 2, and d = (1,-1) of weight 1. The weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its steps.
%C A247469 A weak peak in a lattice path is a vertex on the top of a hump. A hump is an upstep followed by 0 or more flatsteps followed by a downstep. For example, the weighted lattice path Hu*duu*h*H*dd has 4 weak peaks (shown by the stars).
%C A247469 Row n contains n-1 entries (n>=2).
%C A247469 Sum of entries in row n is A004148(n+1) (the 2ndary structure numbers).
%C A247469 T(n,0) = A000045(n+1) (the Fibonacci numbers).
%C A247469 Sum(k*T(n,k), k=0..n) = A247470(n).

%e A247469 Row 3 is 3, 1 because B(3) = {u*d, hH, Hh, hhh} (weak peaks shown by *).
