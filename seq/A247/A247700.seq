%N A247700 Numbers which have d digits "d", whenever one of their digits is "d", ordered by largest digit, then by size of the number.
%C A247700 This sequence lists the same terms as A108571, but ordered first by the largest digit in the number, then by size. This way, a truncation to the first 1, 5, 80, 14381,... terms is this very same sequence for bases b=2, 3, 4, 5, ...
%e A247700 In base 2, the only number with this property is a(1) = 1.
%e A247700 In base 3, this property is again satisfied by 1, but also by the 4 additional terms 22, 122, 212 and 221. They are listed "as such" (without conversion from base 3 to base 10) as a(2),...,a(5).
%e A247700 In base 4, there are 75 more terms (involving three digits "3"), listed as a(6),...,a(80).
