%N A247979 Numbers of the form x^2 + 7y^2 with x, y integers, or x^2/4 + 7y^2/4 with x, y odd integers.
%C A247979 Norms of numbers in O_Q(sqrt(-7)).
%C A247979 A033207 and A045386 are subsets of this sequence. - _Colin Barker_, Sep 29 2014
%e A247979 1/4 + 7/4 = 2, so 2 is in the sequence. (This also means 2 is composite in O_Q(sqrt(-7))).
%e A247979 2^2 + 7 * 0^2 = 4, so 4 is in the sequence.
%e A247979 There is no way to express 5 as x^2 + 7y^2, nor as x^2/4 + 7y^2/4 if x and y are constrained to odd integers, hence 5 is not in the sequence. (This also means 5 is prime in O_Q(sqrt(-7)) and its norm is 25).
