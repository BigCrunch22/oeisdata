%N A247064 Dynamic Betting Game D(n,5,4).
%C A247064 Players A and B bet in a k-round game. Player A has an initial amount of money n. In each round, player A can wager an integer between 0 and what he has. Player A then gains or loses an amount equal to his wager depending on whether player B lets him win or lose. Player B tries to minimize player A's money at the end. The number of rounds player A can lose is r. a(n) is the maximum amount of money player A can have at the end of the game for k = 5 and r = 4.

%e A247064 In the case of n=31: For the 1st round, player A bets 1. If A loses, A will end up with D(30,4,3)=32 per reference A247160. If A wins, he has 32 and will bet 0 for the remaining rounds. So he will end up 32. If A does not follow the proposed bet, he will have fewer than 32 at the end. So a(31) = 32.
