%N A247385 Erroneous decimal expansion (or digits) of Pi engraved in the wall of the Robertson Tunnel at the Washington Park (MAX station), Portland, Oregon. The digits displayed are digits 1-11, 102-111, 202-211, 302-311, 402-411, 502-511, 602-611, 702-711, 802-811, 902-911, 12-17.
%C A247385 This sequence begins with 3, the first digit of Pi. The rest of the sequence is the result of organizing the next 1000 digits of Pi in groups of 10, starting a new line after each 10 groups, and then reading the digits of the first resulting column followed by the first six digits from the second. In the engraving, the characters are arranged in a 12 X 9 grid, with the decimal point counting as one of the 108 characters.
