%N A045903 Number of nonisomorphic systems of catafusenes in an example in Cyvin et al. (1994) with two appendages to the core indexed by the total number of hexagons in the appendages.
%C A045903 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, May 25 2019: (Start)
%C A045903 This is column alpha = 2 in Table 5 on p. 1179 of Cyvin et al. (1994). (The table starts with column alpha = 0.) Here, the index alpha for the columns in Table 5 is the number of appendages to the core.
%C A045903 The table refers to the example described on pp. 1177-1179 of the paper and especially to Figure 5 (p. 1178). The entries refer to the number of nonisomorphic systems of catafusenes in this example (as shown in Figure 5, p. 1178).
%C A045903 The rows of Table 5 are indexed by the total number of hexagons in the appendages.
%C A045903 Therefore, a(n) = number of nonisomorphic systems of catefusenes in the example on pp. 1177-1179 of Cyvin et al. (1994) with alpha = 2 appendages to the core, where n = total number of hexagons in the appendages.
%C A045903 From Note 10 (p. 1180) in Cyvin et al. (1994), we see that (most probably) the number of hexagons a (= n in this sequence) does not include any hexagons in the core.
