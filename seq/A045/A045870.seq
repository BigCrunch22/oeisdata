%e A045870 A045869(1) = 2034, and the divisors of 2034_5 = 269 (a prime) are 1 and 269; in base 5, these are 1 and 2034. Each digit from 0 through 4 appears exactly once, so a(1) = 1.
%e A045870 A045869(2) = 2403; 2403_5 = 353 (a prime) has divisors 1 and 353, which in base 5 are 1 and 2403, so each digit in 0..4 appears exactly once, so a(2) = 2.
%e A045870 A045869(3) = 2430; 2430_5 = 365 = 5*73, so its divisors are 1, 5, 73, and 365, which in base 5 are 1, 10, 243, and 2430, so each digit in 0..4 appears exactly twice, so a(3) = 2.
