%N A045779 Number of factorizations of n into distinct factors for some n (image of A045778).
%C A045779 We may use A045778(k*m) >= A045778(k) for any k, m >= 1 to disprove presence of some positive integer in this sequence. - _David A. Corneth_, Oct 24 2024

%e A045779 From _David A. Corneth_, Oct 24 2024: (Start)
%e A045779 5 is a term as 24 has five factorizations into distinct divisors of 24 namely 24 = 2 * 12 = 3 * 8 = 4 * 6 = 2 * 3 * 4 which is five such factorizations.
%e A045779 11 is not a term. From terms in A025487 only the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 30, 32, 36, 48, 60, 64, 72, 96, 128, 256, 512, 1024 have no more than 11 such factorizations. Any multiple of these numbers in A025487 that is not already listed has more than 11 such factorizations which proves 11 is not in this sequence. (End)
%Y A045779 Factorizations are A001055, with image A045782, with complement A330976.
