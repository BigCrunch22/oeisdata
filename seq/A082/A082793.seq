%N A082793 A tribonacci triangle in which the top two northeast and southeast diagonals consist of tribonacci numbers.
%C A082793 Uses a Hosoya-like format except that the latter has the Fibonacci recursion. This triangle uses the tribonacci recursion such that every interior number can be obtained by adding the 3 previous numbers, on its diagonal.

%F A082793 T(n, j) = T(n-1, j) + T(n-2, j) + T(n-3, j); (every interior number can be obtained by adding the three previous numbers, on its diagonal.)
%e A082793 T(7,3) = 14 = (8 + 4 + 2) = T(6,3) + T(5,3) + T(4,3).
