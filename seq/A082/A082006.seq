%N A082006 In the following square array numbers (not occurring earlier) are entered like this: a(1, 1), a(1, 2), a(2, 1), a(3, 1), a(2, 2), a(1, 3), a(1, 4), a(2, 3), a(3, 2), a(4, 1), a(5, 1), a(4, 2), ... such that every entry is coprime to the members of the row and column it belongs, with the condition that the n-th diagonal sum is a multiple of n. 1 2 7 9 31 25... 4 5 11 23 27... 3 13 8... 19 21... 17 ... ... Sequence contains numbers as they are entered.
%C A082006 Next term T(6,1) =a(21)> 500000, a(21) is odd. The sum of the first diagonal is 1 (a multiple of 1). The sum of the second diagonal is T(1,2)+T(2,1)=2+4=6 (a multiple of 2). The sum of the 3rd diagonal is T(1,3)+T(2,2)+T(3,1)=7+5+3=15 (a multiple of 3). The sum of the 4th diagonal is T(1,4)+T(2,3)+T(3,2)+T(4,1)=9+11+13+19=52 (a multiple of 4). The members of the first row (1,2,7,9,31,25,..) are mutually coprime. The members of the 2nd row (4,5,11,23,27,..) are mutually coprime. The members of the first column (1,4,3,19,17,..) are mutually coprime. The members of the 2nd column (2,5,13,21,..) are mutually coprime. The a(n) transverses the table in meandering fashion: first diagonal up, 2nd diagonal down, 3rd diagonal up, 4th down etc. - _R. J. Mathar_, May 06 2006
%C A082006 From _Alois P. Heinz_, Oct 06 2009: (Start)
%C A082006 T(6,1) is undefined, so there are no further terms.
%C A082006 For T(6,1) would be == 3 (mod 6) w.r.t. antidiagonal 6, (T(6,1)+159=6k) and it would be == 1 or == 5 (mod 6) w.r.t. column 1 (coprime to 3 & 4) which is impossible, unless backtracking is allowed and earlier elements are altered. But that is not intended by the author, because "sequence contains numbers as they are entered", and it would not make a valid definition at all. (End)
