%N A082224 Square array read by antidiagonals alternately upwards and downwards. A(i, j) is the least positive integer not occurring earlier in the sequence such that (1) if j > 1, then the j-th partial sum of the i-th row is prime; and (2) if i > 1, then the i-th partial sum of the j-th column is composite (with A(1,1) = 1).
%e A082224 Array A(i,j) (with rows i >= 1 and columns j >= 1) begins:

%e A082224 A(1,2) = 2 because i = 1, j = 2 > 1, and 1 + 2 = 3 is prime (2nd partial sum of 1st row).
