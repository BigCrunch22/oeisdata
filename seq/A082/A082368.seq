%C A082368 Number of combinations that are possible when placing teams ranked #1 to #4*N in a single elimination tournament where there are four columns of N teams (as in the NCAA Men's Division-1 basketball tournament that is played in March) and each column is a separate regional tournament that produces one of the four semi-finalists. (The teams in the columns appear in sorted order and the relative positions of the four columns is irrelevant.)

%F A082368 a(n) = Integral_{x=0..256} x^n*W(x) dx, n>=0, where W(x) = x^(1/4)*hypergeometric3F2([1/4, 1/4, 1/4], [1/2, 3/4], x/256)/(96*Gamma(3/4)^4) - sqrt(x)*hypergeometric3F2([1/2, 1/2, 1/2], [3/4, 5/4], x/256)/(96*Pi^2) + Gamma(3/4)^4*x^(3/4)*hypergeometric3F2([3/4, 3/4, 3/4], [5/4, 3/2], x/256)/(768*Pi^4) is positive and unimodal on x = [0, 256]. It has a single maximum at approximately x = 31, and it goes to zero with W'(x) diverging, at both x = 0 and x = 256. This integral representation as the n-th power moment of the positive function W(x) on the interval [0, 256] is unique, as W(x) is the solution of the Hausdorff moment problem. (End)
%F A082368 a(n) = A008977(n)/24. - _Vaclav Kotesovec_, Feb 14 2024
%e A082368 8 ranked teams (n=2) in a four region, single elimination tournament generates 105 different possible tournament orderings, where the teams in each region are ordered from best to worst. (Teams would be matched up from top to bottom and continue towards the middle two for other matchups, when more than two teams are listed in each column.) 105 tournaments is too many to list here. As this formula applies to single elimination tournaments, this enumeration formula really only makes sense when n is even.
