%N A082274 Palindromes k such that k + 2 is also a palindrome.
%C A082274 Perhaps from 8th term onwards the only members are a(n) = 10^(n-7) - 1 for n > 7.
%C A082274 The above conjecture is true. Adding two to the least significant digit of a number can result in a carry of at most 1, which only happens if the digit of least significance is 8 or 9. If the least significant digit is 8, adding two results in that digit becoming 0, so the resulting number can't be palindromic. If only the k least and most significant digits are 9, the least significant digit will become 1 and all other adjacent digits 9 will turn into the digit 0 and produce a carry of 1. For the starting number to have been palindromic, the k most significant digits must also be 9's. Any digits that are not 9's between the 9's will not produce a carry on their own when increased by one through the previous carry, resulting in a nonpalindromic number with some 9's as most significant digits and a single 1 and 0's as least significant digits. - _Felix Fröhlich_, Jul 22 2014
