%N A082790 Number of nonisomorphic configurations of degree >= 2 (or generators) of n triples in Steiner triple systems.
%C A082790 A configuration is a set of triples (of points) where every pair of points occurs in at most one triple. (A Steiner triple system is a set of triples where every pair occurs exactly once; thus configurations are often called partial Steiner triple systems). The triples are also called blocks.
%C A082790 A 'generator' is 'a configuration where every point occurs in at least two blocks'. The term refers to the work of Horak, Phillips, Wallis & Yucas, who show that the number of occurrences of a configuration in a Steiner triple system is expressible as a linear form in the numbers of occurrences of the generators.
%C A082790 If you relax the restriction on the number of times a pair of points can occur in a configuration - so that a configuration is just any multi-set of triples - then we get A050913.
