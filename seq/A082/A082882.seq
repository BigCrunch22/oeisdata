%N A082882 Number of distinct values of A075860(j) when j runs through composite numbers between n-th and (n+1)-th primes. That is, the counts of different fixed-points[=prime] reached by iteration of function A008472(=sum of prime factors) initiated with composite values between two consecutive primes.
%C A082882 This count is smaller than A001223[n]-1 and albeit not frequently but it can be one even if primes of borders are not twin primes. Such primes are collected into A082883.
%F A082882 a(n) = Card(Union(A075860(x)); x=1+p(n), ..., -1+p(n+1)).
%e A082882 Between p(23)=83 and p(24)=89, the relevant fixed points are
%e A082882 {5,13,2,2,13}, i.e., four are distinct from the 5 values, a(24)=4;
%e A082882 between p(2033)=17707 and p(2034)=170713, the fixed-point set is {5,5,5,5,5}, so a(2033)=1, so a(88)=1.
