%N A082399 a(1) = 1; thereafter, a(n) is the smallest nonnegative number such that the number Sum_{i=1..n} a(i)*10^(n-i) is divisible by n.
%C A082399 Suggested by studying A144688. If all a(n) had turned out to be in the range 0 to 9 then this sequence would have produced a counterexample to the assertion that A144688 is finite.
%C A082399 The old entry with this A-number was a duplicate of A080825.

%e A082399 After we have the first 11 terms, 1,0,2,0,0,0,5,6,4,0,5, the next number x must be chosen so that 102000564050 + x is divisible by 12; this implies that x = 10.
