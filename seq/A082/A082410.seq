%N A082410 a(1)=0. Thereafter, the sequence is constructed using the rule: for any k >= 0, if a(1), a(2), ..., a(2^k+1) are known, the next 2^k terms are given as follows: a(2^k+1+i) = 1 - a(2^k+1-i) for 1 <= i <= 2^k.
%C A082410 a(n) is A014577 shifted right twice (the definition here is similar to one of the constructions for A034947). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jul 27 2012
%C A082410 Complement of characteristic function of A060833.
%C A082410 From _Tanya Khovanova_, Apr 21 2020: (Start)
%C A082410 Suppose you have a deck of cards face down with 2^n cards such that the color pattern corresponds to this sequence: 0 for one color, 1 for the other. Then you proceed in the following manner: transfer to top card to the bottom of the deck, deal the next card, then repeat. The dealt cards will have alternating colors.
%C A082410 Even terms of this sequence alternate: 1, 0, 1, 0 and so on.
%C A082410 Removing even-indexed terms doesn't change the sequence. (End)

%F A082410 a(1) = 0, a(4*n+2) = 1, a(4*n+4) = 0, a(2*n+1) = a(n+1) for n >= 0. - _A.H.M. Smeets_, Jul 27 2018
%e A082410 First 3 terms are 0,1,1; therefore, a(4) = a(3+1) = 1 - a(3-1) = 1 - a(2) = 0, a(5) = a(3+2) = 1 - a(3-2) = 1 - a(1) = 1 and the sequence begins 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, ...
