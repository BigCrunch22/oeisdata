%N A082615 Palindromes such that the GCD of any pair of successive terms is a palindromic prime.
%C A082615 From _Danny Rorabaugh_, Mar 21-24 2015: (Start)
%C A082615 This sequence is generated by setting a(1)=2 and letting a(n+1) be the least palindromic integer strictly greater than a(n) such that GCD(a(n),a(n+1)) is a palindromic prime.
%C A082615 By initiating with a different palindrome, a different sequence is generated: for example, [3, 6, 8, ...] or [151, 1661, 1771, 1881, 1991, 2002, 3113, ...]. 323 is the smallest palindrome greater than 1 whose sequence does not eventually coincide with the present sequence. Indeed, 323 is the smallest palindrome greater than 1 with no palindromic prime factor (thus, as with 1, the sequence beginning with 323 has only one term).
%C A082615 I conjecture that every sequence generated in this fashion, beginning with a palindrome that has a palindromic prime factor, is infinite and eventually coincides with this sequence.
%C A082615 (End)
%C A082615 The sequence, started with any palindrome having a palindromic prime factor, is certainly infinite: if a(n) is a palindrome divisible by palindromic prime p, then M = p*(1+10^m) for large enough m is another palindrome;  if m is divisible by the order of 10 mod q for every prime q other than 2 and 5 dividing a(n), then gcd(M,a(n)) = p. - _Robert Israel_, Mar 24 2015
