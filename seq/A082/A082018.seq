%N A082018 First column of square array T(n,k) with T(1,1) = 1 where antidiagonals are filled alternating upwards and downwards with the smallest number not already used such that the n-th antidiagonal sum is a multiple of n.
%C A082018 This is the boustrophedon method of filling an array. Sums of antidiagonals of T are in A074132. Sums of antidiagonals of T divided by number of antidiagonals are in A074133. Diagonal of T is in A082019.
