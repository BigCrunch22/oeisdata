%N A082270 a(1) = 1; for n >= 1, a(n+1) = smallest number not occurring earlier such that a(n)*a(n+1) + 1 is a palindrome.
%e A082270 a(51)=54; 54*1 + 1 = palindrome 55 but 1 occurs already at a(1); next 54*11 + 1 = 595 but 11 occurs already at a(7); next 54*14 + 1 = 757 but 14 occurs at a(5); next 54*17 + 1 = 919 but 17 occurs at a(13); ...; finally 54*111 + 1 = 5995 and 111 did not yet occur so 111 is included as next term a(52).
