%N A082236 a(1) = 1 and then numbers such that the product of n terms starting with the n-th term is an n-th power. The smallest numbers not occurring earlier are used first.
%e A082236 as a(3) = 8 choose a(4) = 3 ( smallest number not occurring earlier) and a(5) = 9 to satisfy the requirement. The product of three terms starting with a(3) is 8*3*9 = 216 = 6^3.
