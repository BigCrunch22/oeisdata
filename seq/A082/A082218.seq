%N A082218 Square array T(i,j) in which for every k, the k-th partial sums of every row and column are divisible by k. Array read by antidiagonals, alternating upwards and downwards. Each entry is the least number not already used that fits the divisibility requirement.
%C A082218 In the square array T shown above, numbers (not occurring earlier) are entered like this, T(1, 1), T(1, 2), T(2, 1), T(3, 1), T(2, 2), T(1, 3), T(1, 4), T(2, 3), T(3, 2), T(4, 1), T(5, 1), T(4, 2), ... in such a way that every n-th partial sum of a row or a column is a multiple of n.
%C A082218 T(i, j) must satisfy a congruence mod i and another congruence mod j. i and j are not always relatively prime, but this pair of congruences is always solvable. See the link for a proof. - _David Wasserman_, Aug 26 2004

%e A082218 We start with T(1,1) = 1.
%e A082218 T(1,2) = 3 because i = 1, j = 2, and 1 + 3 = 4 which is divisible by j = 2. (We rejected 2 because 1 + 2 = 3, which is not divisible by 2.)
%e A082218 T(2,1) = 5 because i = 2 > 1, j = 1, and 1 + 5 = 6, which is divisible by j = 2. (We rejected 2 because 1 + 2 = 3, which is not divisible by j = 2. For the same reason, we rejected 4 because 1 + 4 = 5.)
%e A082218 T(3,1) = 6 because i = 3 > 1, j = 1, and 1 + 5 + 6 = 12, which is divisible by i = 3. (We rejected 2 because 1 + 5 + 2 = 8, which is not divisible by i = 3. For the same reason, we rejected 4 because 1 + 5 + 4 = 10.)
%e A082218 T(2,2) = 7 because i = 2 = j, 5 + 7 = 12, which is divisible by i = 2, and 3 + 7 = 10, which is divisible by j = 2. (We rejected 2, because 5 + 2 = 7 is not divisible by i = 2. We also rejected 4 because 5 + 4 = 9 is not divisible by i = 2.)
%e A082218 T(1,3) = 2 because i = 1, j = 3, and 1 + 3 + 2 = 6, which is divisible by j = 3. (End)
