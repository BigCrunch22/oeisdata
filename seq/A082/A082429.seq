%N A082429 a(n) is the cardinality of the smallest subset S1 of S={1,2,3,...,n} such that every element of S is either in S1 or is the sum of two elements of S1.
%e A082429 a(6)=3 since, for S1={1,2,4}, we have 1=1, 2=2, 3=1+2, 4=4, 5=1+4 and 6=2+4 and no set S1 with fewer than three elements has the required property.
