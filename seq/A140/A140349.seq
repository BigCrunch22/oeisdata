%N A140349 A number k is included if both (the largest divisor of k that is <= sqrt(k)) and (the smallest divisor of k that is >= sqrt(k)) are composite.
%C A140349 All numbers that are each the square of a composite are included in the sequence. All numbers that are the square of a prime are excluded from the sequence.
%C A140349 A prime power p^h is included if and only if h >= 4. - _Robert Israel_, Jun 21 2018

%e A140349 The divisors of 80 are 1,2,4,5,8,10,16,20,40,80. The middle two divisors are 8 and 10, which are both composite. So 80 is included in the sequence.
