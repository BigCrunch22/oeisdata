%N A140755 Square array read by rows: T(n,k) = 41*n^2 + k^2 + n*k, with 20 columns.
%C A140755 The original definition of this sequence was obscure: "A prime array is embedded in a binary quadratic equation that is a transform of x^2 -x + 41".
%F A140755 41b^2 + ab + a^2, a = column 1:20, b = row 1:8, factor the row number b starting at b = 2 and remove all prime factors in b (on row 2 just 2's) from all terms on the row. Repeat the process for all rows. The numbers that remain at the end of the process in the 20*8 array will all be prime
%e A140755 a = 16, b = 2, S(16,2) = 452, 452/2 = 226, 226/2 = 113 (a prime}
%e A140755 a = 6, b = 3, S(6,3) = 423, 423/3 = 141, 141/3 = 47 (a prime}
%e A140755 a = 6, b = 6, S(6,6) = 1548, 1548/2 = 774, 774/2 = 387, 387/3 = 129,
%e A140755 129/3 = 43 (a prime}
