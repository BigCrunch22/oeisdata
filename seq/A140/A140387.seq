%N A140387 Binary encoding of the location of primes in integer sets r+30*n with remainder r=1,7,11,..,29.
%C A140387 Classify all integers 30n+r with r= 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 or 29 as nonprime or prime and assign bit positions 0=LSB, 1, 2, 3, .., 7=MSB to the 8 remainders in the same order. Raise the bit if 30n+r is nonprime, erase it if 30n+r is prime.
%C A140387 The sequence interprets this as a number in base 2 and shows the decimal representation.
%e A140387 For n=1, the 8 numbers 31 (r=1), 37 (r=7), 41 (r=11), 43 (r=17), 47 (r=17), 49 (r=19), 53 (r=23) and 59 (r=29) are prime, prime, prime, prime, prime, nonprime, prime, prime, prime, which is rendered into the binary 000100000 = 2^5=32=a(1).
