%N A140656 Arises in a simple, polynomial-time algorithm for the matrix torsion problem.
%C A140656 Nicolas, Corollary 1, p.4, cites Mandel and Simon, Lemma 4.1: let d be in N^*, then every d x d torsion matrix M satisfies M^((2*d^2)! + d) = M^d.
%C A140656 Abstract: The Matrix Torsion Problem (MTP) is: given a square matrix M with rational entries, decide whether two distinct powers of M are equal. It has been shown by Cassaigne and the author that the MTP reduces to the Matrix Power Problem (MPP) in polynomial time: given two square matrices A and B with rational entries, the MTP is to decide whether B is a power of A. Since the MPP is decidable in polynomial time, it is also the case of the MTP. However, the algorithm for MPP is highly nontrivial. The aim of this note is to present a simple, direct, polynomial-time algorithm for the MTP.
