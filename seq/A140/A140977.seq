%e A140977 4 in binary is 100, which has 2 zeros. Checking the binary representations of the integers > 4: 5 = 101 in binary, which has one 0. 6 = 110 in binary, which has one 0. 7 = 111 in binary, which has zero 0's. 8 = 1000 in binary, which has three 0's. But 9 = 1001 in binary, which has two 0's, the same number of zeros that 4 (= 100 in binary) has. So a(4) = 9.
