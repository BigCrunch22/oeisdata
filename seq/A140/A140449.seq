%N A140449 a(n) = the multiple of A142972(n) such that the n-th prime <= a(n) <= the (n+1)th prime.
%C A140449 There is always only one multiple of A142972(n) that is between the n-th prime and the (n+1)th prime.
%e A140449 The 15th prime is 47 and the 16th prime is 53. So we will examine the integers 47,48,49,50,51,52,53. Now, 1 divides each of these integers. 2 divides 48,50,52. 3 divides 48 and 51. 4 divides 48 and 52. 5 divides 50. 6 divides 48. 7 divides 49. 8 divides 48. But 9 doesn't divide any integer in the span of consecutive integers 47 to 53. So 8 is the largest integer m such that 1,2,3,4,...m each divide at least one integer in the span 47 to 53. 48 is the multiple of 8 among the integers in the span. So a(15) = 48.
