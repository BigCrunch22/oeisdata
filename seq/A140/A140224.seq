%N A140224 Triangle: T(n,m) is number of m's among (d(1),d(2),...,d(n)), where d(n) = A000005(n).
%e A140224 The sequence of the numbers of divisors of the first 12 positive integers is: 1,2,2,3,2,4,2,4,3,4,2,6.
%e A140224 There is one 1 in this list, five 2's, two 3's, three 4's, zero 5's, one 6 and zero of any other positive integer. So row 12 of the triangle is: 1,5,2,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.
