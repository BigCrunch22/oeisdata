%N A140459 A positive integer n is included if n can be added to d(n) in binary without any carries, where d(n) is the number of positive divisors of n. In other words, no 1 in the binary representation of n is in the same position as any 1 in the binary representation of d(n).

%e A140459 27 in binary is 11011. 27 has 4 divisors. 4 in binary is 100. Comparing 11011 and 100, it is seen that the two do not have any ones in the same position, so 27 is included in the sequence.
