%N A140316 Write n in base 3, delete 0's.
%C A140316 This is to A038585 as A007088 is to A007089.
%e A140316 a(29) = 12 because 29 base 3 = A007089(29) = 1002 and upon deleting 0's, this becomes 12. Note the fixed points (input in decimal, output in zeroless base 3) begin 1, 2, 21, 111, ... with for example, 21 base 10 becoming 21 base 3 = A007089(21) = 210 and upon deleting 0's, this becomes 21 again; and 111 base 10 becoming A007089(111) = 11010 and upon deleting 0's, this becomes 111 again.
