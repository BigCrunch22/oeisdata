%N A140600 Grand totals of prime factors in composite runs between two primes.
%C A140600 In this sequence a run consists of three or more terms, the first prime, one or more composites and the last prime. The values of the two primes are not included in the grand total of prime factors (only the prime factors in the composites).
%F A140600 Compute composite runs between two primes. If the grand total of prime factors in each run is also prime, add the prime grand total to the sequence.
%e A140600 In a(6) the grand total is 37 because that is the prime sum of all the prime factors of composites in the composite run beginning at 24 (between primes 23 and 29).
%Y A140600 Cf. A140599.
