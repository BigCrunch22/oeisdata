%N A140800 Total number of vertices in all finite n-dimensional convex regular polytopes, or 0 if the number is infinite.
%C A140800 _Andrew Weimholt_ suggests a related sequence, namely "total number of vertices in all finite n-dimensional regular polytopes, or 0 if the number is infinite, includes both convex and non-convex, beginning: 1, 2, 0, 106, 2453, 48, 83, 150, 281, 540, ... and writes that the sequence of just the non-convex cases (0, 0, -1, 56, 1680, 0, 0, 0, ..., where "-1" indicates infinity as zero is otherwise employed) is not as interesting, since it's all zeros from a(5) on.

%e A140800 a(0) = 1 because the 0-D regular polytope is the point.
%e A140800 a(1) = 2 because the only regular 1-D polytope is the line segment, with 2 vertices, one at each end.
%e A140800 a(2) = 0, indicating infinity, because the regular k-gon has k vertices.
%e A140800 a(3) = 50 (4 for the tetrahedron, 6 for the octahedron, 8 for the cube, 12 for the icosahedron, 20 for the dodecahedron) = the sum of A053016.
%e A140800 a(4) = 773 = 5 + 8 + 16 + 24 + 120 + 600 = sum of A063924.
%e A140800 For n>4 there are only the three regular n-dimensional polytopes, the simplex with n+1 vertices, the hypercube with 2^n vertices and the hyperoctahedron = cross polytope = orthoplex with 2*n vertices, for a total of A086653(n) + 1 = 2^n + 3*n + 1 (again restricted to n > 4).
