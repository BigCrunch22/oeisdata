%C A140393 This is a new calculation of A000170 which produced a different answer for n=24. I do not know which version is correct and I have therefore created this second entry for the values found by the NQueens(AT)home team. See the main entry for this sequence, A000170, for many further references and comments.
%C A140393 As discovered on Nov 07 2008, this sequence is likely to suffer from an overflow error in the implementation of the NQueens(AT)Home project. The results differ by 781684047872 = 0xb600000000 = 182 * 2^32.
