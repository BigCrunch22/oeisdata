%N A140602 Values of m for which C(m,a)+C(m,a+1)=C(m+1,a+1) divides C(m,2a+1) for some nonnegative integer a with 2a+1 <= m.
%C A140602 See A140601 which is the main entry for this sequence.
%C A140602 Some large terms of this sequence: 255959 (a=47), 618799 (a=25). - _Max Alekseyev_, Sep 19 2015
%e A140602 a(1)=34 because C(34,6) + C(34,7) = 1344904 + 5379616 = 6724520 divides C(34,13) = 927983760.
