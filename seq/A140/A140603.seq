%N A140603 Values of m for which C(m,a) + C(m,a+2) divides C(m,2a+2) for some nonnegative integer a with 2a+2 <= m.
%C A140603 See A140601 which is the main entry for this sequence.
%e A140603 a(1) = 19 because C(19,3) + C(19,5) = 969 + 11628 = 12597 divides C(19,8) = 75582, and 19 is the smallest nonnegative integer for which the required condition holds.
