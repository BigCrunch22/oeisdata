%N A140891 Binary encoding of the prime-ness of the 6 integers r+14*n with remainder r=1, 3, 5, 9, 11 or 13.
%C A140891 Classify all integers 14n+r with r= 1, 3, 5, 9, 11 or 13 as nonprime or prime and assign hit positions 0=LSB, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5=MSB to the 6 remainders in the same order. Raise the bit if 14n+r is nonprime, erase it if 14n+r is prime.
%C A140891 The sequence interprets this as a number in base 2 and shows the decimal representation.
%e A140891 For n=2, the 6 numbers 29 (r=1), 31 (r=3), 33 (r=5), 37 (r=9), 39 (r=11) and 41 (r=13) are prime, prime, nonprime, prime, nonprime, prime, which is rendered into the binary 001010 = 2^2+2^4=4+16=20=a(2).
