%N A140074 Excess over the asymptote of the number of perfect squares between cubes.
%C A140074 There are always at least two squares between positive consecutive cubes, starting with the perfect squares 1 and 4 between the perfect cubes 1 (included) and 8 (excluded).
%C A140074 The number of squares between the cube of n (included) and the cube of n+1 (excluded) is always one of the two integers bracketing 3*sqrt(n)/2.
%C A140074 The number a(n) in the sequence is 0 if the correct count is the lower number or 1 if the actual count is the higher number.
%H A140074 G. P. Michon, <a href="http://www.numericana.com/answer/numbers.htm#bits">A Sequence of Bits with Strange Statistics</a>.
%F A140074 a(n) = floor(sqrt((n+1)^3-1)) - ceiling(sqrt(n^3)) + 1 - floor(1.5 sqrt(n))
%e A140074 The sequence starts with a(0)=1 for n=0 because there is just one perfect square (0) between the cube of 0 (included) and the cube of 1 (excluded).
%e A140074 This exceeds by a(0)=1 the asymptotic expression floor(1.5*sqrt(n)) for the value n=0.
