%N A140343 a(n)=4a(n-1)-7a(n-2)+6a(n-3)-3a(n-4), n>4.
%C A140343 This is the main sequence representing the degenerate case of sequences which equal their sixth differences, where, besides the generic a(n)=6a(n-1)-15a(n-2)+20a(n-3)-15a(n-4)+6a(n-5), cf. A135356, there is also a shorter recurrence. Another sequence of this kind is A134581.
