%N A140947 Four-columned array read by rows: each row gives a series of 4 consecutive primes that share a 2nd-degree polynomial relationship and produce a positive-only integer series from the derived quadratic.
%C A140947 These "proximate-prime polynomials" exhibit high prime densities. Of the 333 under 100000, 46 have greater than 50% prime values for the first 1000 terms. 2221 positive-only PPPs have been found under 1000000. All positive-integer PPPs have complex roots (only negative-integer PPPs, which are excluded) have real roots. The roots mostly have a real part of 1/2 or a multiple of 1/2.

%F A140947 Method of common differences: if (P2 - P1) - (P3 - P2) = (P3 - P2) - (P4 - P3) then polynomial is degree 2.
%e A140947 For 17, 19, 23, 29 the method of common differences produces coefficients of 1, -1 and 17 for a polynomial expression of n^2 - n + 17.
