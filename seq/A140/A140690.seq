%N A140690 A positive integer n is included if n written in binary can be subdivided into a number of runs all of equal-length, the first run from the left consisting of all 1's, the next run consisting of all 0's, the next run consisting of all 1's, the next run consisting of all 0's, etc.
%C A140690 Also: numbers of the form (2^s-1)*[4^{s*(k+1)}-1]/(4^s-1) or 2^s(2^s-1)*[4^{s*(k+1)}-1]/(4^s-1), s>=1, k>=0. Subsequences are, with the possible exception of terms at n=0, A002450(n), A043291(n), A015565(2n), A093134(2n+1), A000225(n), A020522(n). [_R. J. Mathar_, Aug 04 2008]
%C A140690 From _Emeric Deutsch_, Jan 25 2018: (Start)
%C A140690 Also the indices of the compositions having equal parts.
%C A140690 We define the index of a composition to be the positive integer whose binary form has run-lengths (i.e. runs of 1's, runs of 0's, etc., from left to right) equal to the parts of the composition. Example: the composition [1,1,3,1] has index 46 since the binary form of 46 is 101110. The integer 992 is in the sequence since its binary form is 1111100000 and the composition [5,5] has equal parts. The integer 100 is not in the sequence since its binary form is 1100100 and the composition [2,2,1,2] does not have equal parts.
%C A140690 The command c(n) from the Maple program yields the composition having index n. (End)

%e A140690 819 in binary is 1100110011. The runs of 0's and 1's are (11)(00)(11)(00)(11). Each run (alternating 1's and 0's) is the same length. So 819 is in the sequence.
