%N A140118 Extrapolation for (n + 1)-st odd prime made by fitting least-degree polynomial to first n odd primes.
%C A140118 Construct the least-degree polynomial p(x) which fits the first n odd primes (p has degree n - 1 or less). Then predict the next prime by evaluating p(n + 1).
%C A140118 a(n) = sum_1_n p_i (-1)^(n - i) binomial(n, i - 1) where p_i are the primes.
%C A140118 Can anything be said about the pattern of positive and negative values?
%C A140118 How many of these terms are the correct (n + 1)th prime?
%C A140118 How many terms are prime?
%C A140118 The terms at indices 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 13, 17, 20, 24, 32, 54, 75, 105, 283, 676, 769, 1205 and 1300 actually are prime (ignoring negative signs).
