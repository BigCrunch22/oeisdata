%N A140887 Number of nonprimes in [30n - 30, 30n] coprime to 30.
%C A140887 For almost all n, a(n) = phi(30) = 8. It first attains this value at a(361).
%e A140887 {1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29} are coprime to 30 in [0, 30]; 1 is nonprime, so a(1) = 1.
%e A140887 {31,37,41,43,47,49,53,59} are coprime to 30 in [30, 60]; 49 is nonprime, so a(2) = 1.
