%N A140335 Smallest number greater than a(n-1) that, when adding the reciprocals of all the terms up to it, the sum is <= 3.
%C A140335 The definition similar to this except that it reaches 2 is simply 1, 2, 3, 6.
%C A140335 The sequence ends at a(13) because Sum_{n=1..13} 1/a(n) = 3. - _Joerg Arndt_, Sep 06 2019
%e A140335 11 does not qualify for the term after 10 because the sum of the reciprocals of the first 11 terms would then fall between 3.01 and 3.02.
%Y A140335 Cf. A281873 (sum <= 4).
