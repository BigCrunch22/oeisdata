%N A140124 a(n) = degree in N of the number of orbits under S_N of the set of n-tuples of partitions of {1,...,N} into n subsets.
%C A140124 This formula and its first two values are given in Bergman, p. 18. Abstract: Erdos and Szekeres showed in 1978 that for any four positive integers satisfying m_1+m_2 = n_1+n_2, the two binomial coefficients (m_1+m_2)!/m_1! m_2! and (n_1+n_2)!/n_1! n_2! have a common divisor >1. The analogous statement for families of k k-nomial coefficients (k>1) was conjectured in 1997 by David Wasserman. Erdos and Szekeres remark that if m_1, m_2, n_1, n_2 as above are all >1, there is probably a lower bound on the common divisor in question which goes to infinity as a function of m_1+m_2. Such a bound is here obtained.
%C A140124 Results are proved that narrow the class of possible counterexamples to Wasserman's conjecture. On the other hand, several plausible generalizations of that conjecture are shown to be false.
