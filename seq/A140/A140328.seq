%N A140328 Sum of two squares of Lucas numbers (A000032).
%C A140328 This is to A045702 as Lucas numbers (A000032) are to Fibonacci numbers A000045. Hypotenuse squared of right triangle whose legs are both Lucas numbers.
%F A140328 {k = i + j such that i is in A000032^2 and j is in A000032^2} = {k = i + j such that i is in A001254 and j is in A001254}.
%e A140328 a(1) = 2 because A001254(1) = 1^2 = 1 and 1 + 1 = 2.
%e A140328 a(17) = 125 because A001254(5) = 11^2 = 121, A001254(0) = 2^2 = 4 and 125 + 4 = 125.
%Y A140328 Cf. A000032, A001254, A045702.
