%N A140188 Table read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of groupoids (categories all of whose morphisms are invertible) with n morphisms and k objects.
%C A140188 The first column is T(n,1) = A000001(n) (number of groups of order n).
%C A140188 T(n,k) >= A136406(n,k).
%C A140188 The sum of the n^th row is A140189(n).
%C A140188 For 2k<=n, T(n,n-k) = A140190(k) does not depend on n.
%F A140188 T(n,k) is the sum over the quadratic bi-partitions (n_i,k_i) of (n,k) (see A136406) of the "product" of the A000001(n_i), where the "product" is the usual product except when (n_i1,k_i1)=...=(n_ip,k_ip), in which case a^p is replaced by binomial(a+p-1,p).
