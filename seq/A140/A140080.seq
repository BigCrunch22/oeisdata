%N A140080 Fix e = 3; a(n) = minimal Hamming distance between the binary representation of n and the binary representation of any multiple ke (0 <= k <= n/e) which is a child of n.
%C A140080 A number m is a child of n if the binary representation of n has a 1 in every position where the binary representation of m has a 1.
%C A140080 In other words, this tells us how closely (in Hamming weight) we can approximate n "from below" by a multiple of e.

%e A140080 If n = 14 = 1110_2, take k=2, ke = 6 = 110_2, which is Hamming distance 1 from n. This is the best we can do, so a(14) = 1.
