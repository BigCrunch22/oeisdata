%N A140516 For definition see comments lines.
%C A140516 Inspired by Van der Waerden's Theorem, the positive integers are partitioned into two disjoint sequences, A and B, so that they obey the following rules:
%C A140516 Rule 1: For a given n, let A(n) and B(n) be the subsets of A and B with terms less than or equal to n. Any maximal arithmetic subsequence of A(n) must have at least as many terms as any maximal arithmetic subsequence of B(n).
%C A140516 Rule 2: Construct the sequences by starting at 1 and always favoring to add terms to B, unless it violates Rule 1. Add terms to A if they cannot be added to B.
%C A140516 The sequence listed here is the A sequence.
%e A140516 A gets 1, because B cannot yet have an AS of length 1.
%e A140516 B gets 2, because we favor adding to B and A already has an AS of length 1.
%e A140516 A gets 3, because B cannot yet form an AS of length 2.
%e A140516 B gets 4, because A now has an AS of length 2.
%e A140516 B gets 5, because 2,4,5 does not contain an AS of length 3.
%e A140516 A gets 6, because 2,4,5,6 would contain an AS of length 3.
