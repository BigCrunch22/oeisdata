%N A140068 Triangle read by rows, n-th row = (n-1)-th power of the matrix X * [1,0,0,0,...] where X = an infinite lower triangular matrix with [1,2,1,2,1,2,...] in the main diagonal and [1,1,1,...] in the subdiagonal.
%C A140068 Sum of n-th row terms = odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers, F(2n+1); e.g. sum of row 5 terms = (1 + 15 + 11 + 6 + 1) = 34 = F(9).
%C A140068 The triangle is a companion to A140069 (having row sums = even-indexed Fibonacci numbers).
%F A140068 Triangle read by rows, n-th row = (n-1)-th power of the matrix X * [1,0,0,0,...] where X = an infinite lower triangular matrix with [1,2,1,2,1,2,...] in the main diagonal and [1,1,1,...] in the subdiagonal. Given the matrix X, perform X * [1,0,0,0,...] and then iterate: X * (result), etc. and record the result as each successive row of the triangle.
