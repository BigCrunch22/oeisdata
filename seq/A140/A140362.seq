%N A140362 Semiprimes pq that divide the sum of the squares of their divisors, 1+p^2+q^2+(pq)^2.
%C A140362 6 is the smallest integer n which is the product of two distinct primes and which divides the sum of the cubes of the divisors of n. Are there other numbers with this property?
%C A140362 Using Pell equations and a Fibonacci identity, Max Alekseyev and I have shown that all terms are the product of prime Fibonacci numbers whose indices are twin primes. The first three terms are Fib(3)*Fib(5), Fib(5)*Fib(7) and Fib(11)*Fib(13). The other two known terms are Fib(431)*Fib(433) and Fib(569)*Fib(571), huge numbers that are in the b-file. The sequence probably has no additional terms. - _T. D. Noe_, Jul 27 2008
%C A140362 Let a, b, c and d be consecutive odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers. Then it can be proved that 1 + b^2 + c^2 + (bc)^2 = abcd, which shows that bc divides 1 + b^2 + c^2 + (bc)^2. Hence if b and c are prime, then bc is in this sequence. - _T. D. Noe_, Jul 27 2008
%C A140362 Empirical search suggests that A067558(a(n))/A032741(a(n)) = a(n). A032741(a(n)) = 3 for all n by definition of semiprime. A067558(a(n)) must also then be divisible by 3. a(n) can be called the n-th "perfect mean square aliquot number". - _William Krier_, Dec 16 2024
