%N A140999 Members of A067128 that are the smallest numbers with their prime signatures.
%C A140999 Includes all members of A002182.
%C A140999 Conjecture (false!): includes all members of A094348.
%C A140999 Contribution from _Matthew Vandermast_, Oct 10 2008: (Start)
%C A140999 Counterexample to conjecture: 5354228880, the smallest positive multiple of the first 23 positive integers, does not belong to A067128. It is the smallest member of A003418 (a subsequence of A094348) not to be largely composite.
%C A140999 Intersection of A067128 and A025487.
%C A140999 Includes all members of A097212. (End)
