%N A140443 Difference between n-th Fibonacci number and floored n-th power of Viswanath's constant.
%C A140443 Using the value of Viswanath's constant given by Eric Weisstein's notebook (v = 1.1321506910656020459) makes this sequence different from a(32) forwards; the gap gradually widens after that.

%F A140443 a(n) = F(n) - floor(v^n), where F(n) is given by A000045 with F(1) = F(2) = 1 and v = 1.1319882487943 as given by A078416.
%e A140443 a(7) = 11 because F(7) = 13 and v^7 is approximately 2.38173, which floored is 2, so 13 - 2 = 11.
%t A140443 V = 1.1319882487943; Table[Fibonacci[n] - Floor[V^n], {n, 50}]
