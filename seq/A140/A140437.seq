%e A140437 The number 13 can be partitioned into 3 numbers with the same product in two ways: {1,6,6} and {2,2,9}. It can also be partitioned into 5 numbers with the same product in two ways: {1,1,3,4,4} and {1,2,2,2,6}. 13 can't have 3 different partitions of the same length with the same product. Hence a(13) = 2.
