%N A140956 Triangle read by rows: coefficients of the alternating factorial polynomial (x+1)(x-2)(x+3)(x-4)...(x+n*(-1)^(n-1)).
%C A140956 The coefficients belong to the rows of the following tree, which is built up from the following polynomials:
%C A140956 1
%C A140956 (x+1) = x+1
%C A140956 (x+1)(x-2) = x^2-x-2
%C A140956 (x+1)(x-2)(x+3) = x^3+2x^2-5x-6
%C A140956 (x+1)(x-2)(x+3)(x-4) = x^4-2x^3-13x^2+14x+24 and so on.

%C A140956 Every term of the tree can be denoted by nAm as follows:
%C A140956 1A0 1A1
%C A140956 2A0 2A1 2A2
%C A140956 3A0 3A1 3A2 3A3
%C A140956 4A0 4A1 4A2 4A3 4A4
%C A140956 . . . . . .
%C A140956 nA0 nA1 nA2 nA3 nA4 . . nAn
%C A140956 Properties:
%C A140956 (1) For all positive integers n, nAn = 1
%C A140956 (2) nA0 = n!(-1)^T where T=int(n/2)
%C A140956 (3) For terms of the tree, which are not on the border of the tree, nAm = (-1)^(n+1) * n * (n-1)Am + (n-1)A(m-1). E.g., for m=1, nA1 = (-1)^(n+1) * n * (n-1)A1 + (n-1)A0 and this term has coordinates (n,m)=(n,1). The term with coordinates (3,1) = 3A1 =(-1)^2*3*2A1+2A0 =1*3*-1+-2 = -5
%C A140956 (4) All terms of the tree are integers; this follows from (1), (2) and (3).
%C A140956 (5) For n >= 2, the sum of the terms of any row is given by: Sum of terms of row n = (-1)^T*[n+(-1)^(n-1)]*Sum of terms of row (n-1).
%C A140956 (6) For all n, nA0/[(-1)^T * n! ] = 1
%C A140956 (7) As n approaches infinity, (nA2) / ((-1)^T * n!) approaches (1/2) * (log 2)^2 - (Pi^2) / 12.
%C A140956 As n approaches infinity, (nA3) / ((-1)^T * n!) approaches (1/6) * (log 2)^3 - (1/12) * (Pi^2) * (log 2) + (1/4) * zeta(3) where zeta(3) = Sum_{m >=1} 1/m^3.
%C A140956 (8) Since all terms of the tree are integers, then it follows from (7) that Zeta(3) = (1/3) * (Pi^2) * (log 2) - (2/3) * (log 2)^3 + C, where C is a rational number.
%C A140956 Remember that T equals the integer part of (n divided by 2) and n! equals (factorial n).
