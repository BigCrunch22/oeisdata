%N A140997 Triangle G(n,k) read by rows, for 0 <= k <= n, where G(n, 0) = G(n+1, n+1) = 1, G(n+2, n+1) = 2, G(n+3, n+1) = 4, and G(n+4, m) = G(n+1, m-1) + G(n+1, m) + G(n+2, m) + G(n+3, m) for n >= 0 and m = 1..n+1.
%C A140997 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jun 12 2019: (Start)
%C A140997 This is a mirror image of the triangular array A140994. The current array has index of asymmetry s = 2 and index of obliqueness (obliquity) e = 0. Array A140994 has the same index of asymmetry, but has index of obliqueness e = 1. (In other related sequences, the author uses the letter y for the index of asymmetry and the letter z for the index of obliqueness, but on the stone slab that appears over a tomb in a picture that he posted in those sequences, the letters s and e are used instead. See, for example, the documentation for sequences A140998, A141065, A141066, and A141067.)
%C A140997 In general, if the index of asymmetry (from the Pascal triangle A007318) is s, then the order of the recurrence is s + 2 (because the recurrence of the Pascal triangle has order 2). There are also s + 2 infinite sets of initial conditions (as opposed to the Pascal triangle, which has only 2 infinite sets of initial conditions, namely, G(n, 0) = G(n+1, n+1) = 1 for n >= 0).
%C A140997 Pascal's triangle A007318 has s = 0 and is symmetric, arrays A140998 and A140993 have s = 1 (with e = 0 and e = 1, respectively), and arrays A140996 and A140995 have s = 3 (with e = 0 and e = 1, respectively).

%F A140997 G(n, k) = A140994(n, n-k) for 0 <= k <= n.
%F A140997 Bivariate g.f.: Sum_{n,k >= 0} G(n,k)*x^n*y^k = (1 - x - x^2 - x^3 + x^2*y + x^4*y)/((1 - x) * (1 - x*y) * (1 - x - x^2 - x^3 - x^3*y)).
%F A140997 Differentiating once w.r.t. y and setting y = 0, we get the g.f. of column k = 1: x/((1 - x) * (1 - x - x^2 - x^3)). This is the g.f. of sequence A008937.
