%N A140807 a(n) is the largest integer such that n^k is palindromic in binary for all nonnegative integers k that are <= a(n).
%C A140807 a(2n) = 0 for all n.

%F A140807 For n > 3, a(n)=0 or 1; moreover, a(n)=1 iff n belongs to A006995 (in other words, this sequence is an indicator function of A006995). - _Max Alekseyev_, Jul 22 2008
%e A140807 The powers of 3 are, when written in binary: 1, 11, 1001, 11011, 1010001, ... Now, 3^k written in binary is palindromic for k = 0,1,2 and 3, but not for k=4. So a(3) = 3.
