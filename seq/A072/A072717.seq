%N A072717 Let d(k) be the sequence whose values are in (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) and are such that the continued fraction for the decimal number D(n)=0.d(1)d(2)...d(n) has strictly more elements than the continued fraction for D(n-1)=0.d(1)d(2)...d(n-1) and d(n) is as small as possible. Sequence gives values of d(n)=a(n) for d(1)=1.
%C A072717 The continued fraction for D(3) = 0.123 is [0, 8, 7, 1, 2, 5] with 6 elements the continued fraction for 0.1234 is [0, 8, 9, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 2] with 10 elements > 6 and 4 is the smallest number in (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), hence d(4)=a(4)=4.
