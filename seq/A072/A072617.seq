%N A072617 Number of essentially different ways of arranging numbers 1 through 2n around a circle so that the sum of each pair of adjacent numbers is prime, with the odd and even numbers in order in opposite directions.
%C A072617 A very restricted form of the prime circle problem whose sequence is A051252. Finding these solutions is very fast because there are only n possible solutions to try. See A072616 for the case where only the odd numbers or only the even numbers are in order. Note that a(2)=1 because the two solutions are essentially the same. Solutions can be printed by removing comments from the Mathematica program.
%C A072617 There is a provable solution for n when either (a) 2n+1 and 2n+3 are prime, (b) 2k+1, 2k+3, 2k+2n+1 and 2k+2n+3 are prime for some 0 < k < n-1, or (c) 2n-1, 2n+1 and 4n-1 are primes. Part (a) is due to Mike Hennebry. Note that cases (a) and (b) involve 3 sets of twin primes. For n > 3, due to the form of twin primes, it can be shown that (a) implies not (b) and not (c).
