%N A072041 a(n) is the smallest number of the form k + reverse(k) for exactly n integers k, or -1 if no such number exists.
%C A072041 The negative terms are conjectural. Moreover they have a rather low degree of confirmation, since due to the time-consuming computations only numbers from 0 to 65000 have been taken into account. Random tests of larger numbers however seem to indicate, that only selected values of n occur. - In the cognate sequence A071266 two numbers a and b are counted only once, if n = a + b, a = reverse(b), b = reverse(a). Then 33 = 12 + 21 = 30 + 03 has a count of 2 and 44 = 13 + 31 = 22 + 22 = 40 + 04 has a count of 3, so 44 appears in A071266 instead of 33.
%C A072041 Terms are correct for k <= 10^8. - _Sean A. Irvine_, Aug 27 2024

%e A072041 a(0) = 1, since 1 can in no way be written as k + reverse(k); a(1) = 0, since 0 = k + reverse(k) for k = 0; a(3) = 33, since 33 = k + reverse(k) for k = 12, 21 and 30.
