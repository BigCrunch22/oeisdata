%N A072525 a(0) = 1; a(n+1) is smallest composite number > a(n) such that a(n) + a(n+1) is prime.
%C A072525 The value of a(0) is of minor importance; starting with a(0) = 2, 3, 4, 5, ... results in sequences that differ from this sequence only in a few initial terms.
%C A072525 22, 25, 28 are three and 49,52,55,58 are four consecutive terms in arithmetic progression. Are there k consecutive terms in arithmetic progression for every k?
%e A072525 34 is the next term after 33 since 34 is composite and 33 + 34 = 67 is prime.
