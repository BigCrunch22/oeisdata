%N A072862 The smallest k>1 such that k divides sigma(k*n) is equal to 6.
%C A072862 The smallest k>1 such that k divides sigma(k*n) is always 2, 3 or 6. Sequence generates squares but not all the squares (49, 169, 196, 361, 441, 676, 784, ... are the first squares not in the sequence).
%C A072862 This is not the sequence of solutions to sigma(n) == 1 (mod 6), because 2401 is in this sequence but sigma(2401) == 5 (mod 6). See A074384 for more examples. - _R. J. Mathar_, May 19 2020
