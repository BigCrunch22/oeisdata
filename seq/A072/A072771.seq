%N A072771 X-projection of the tabular N X N -> N bijection A072764 and Y-projection of its transpose A072766.
%C A072771 This corresponds to Lisp/Scheme function 'car' computed with respect to the lexicographical ordering of parenthesizations/planar binary trees (A014486), i.e. with planar binary trees this is equal to extracting the left subtree (from the root), with general parenthesizations equal to taking the first sub-parenthesization of the top-level list and with general plane trees equal to taking the leftmost branch of the tree (at the root).
