%N A072549 a(n) = abs(floor(n + a(n-1)^2/n - n*log(n))) with a(0)=1.
%C A072549 This sequence is based on the cylinder flow equation that is in most fluid dynamics texts. I used a n*log(n) circulation term to slow down the progression that gets very large very fast after n=36.
%C A072549 I take this sequence as an analog of the inverse of the rate of flow in fluid layers around a cylinder and the fluid comes to a near stop when n gets greater than 36. A similar complex plane Julia to this is also possible using the iterative k for the n in this equation and leaving out the absolute value and floor functions.
