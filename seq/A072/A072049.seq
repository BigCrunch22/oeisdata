%N A072049 a(n) = floor(2^(n/(floor(n*log(2)/log(prime(n)))))).
%C A072049 The sequence comes from the relationship of the primes to powers of two: in Sierpi≈Ñski gasket sets the number s(n)=log(prime(n))/log(2) is the Moran dimension of unique fractal types. I first thought of making numbers that take these to integers by multiplication. And then of using integers of those to make other integers as powers of two that were prime like.
%C A072049 The sequence is slow to increase and has an alternating effect so that it dips lower after reaching a peak.
