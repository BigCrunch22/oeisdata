%N A072417 a(n) = smallest positive m such that m! contains exactly n 0's, or 0 if no such m exists.
%e A072417 a(1)=5: 5!=120, which has only 1 zero. Other numbers with only 1 zero are 6 and 9.
%e A072417 a(2)=7 since 7th factorial, i.e., 7!=5040 contains exactly two 0's.
%e A072417 a(3)=0 since no factorial contains just three zeros.
