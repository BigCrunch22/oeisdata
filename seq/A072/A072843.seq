%N A072843 O'Halloran numbers: even integers which cannot be the surface area of a cuboid with integer-length sides.
%C A072843 Named to commemorate the founder of the Australian Mathematics Competition, Peter O'Halloran, shortly before his untimely death in 1994.

%e A072843 The total surface areas of the smallest possible cuboids (1.1.1), (2.1.1),(2.2.1),(3.1.1) and (4.1.1) are, respectively, 6, 10, 16, 14 and 18 square units, assuming their side lengths are whole numbers. Thus the first two O'Halloran Numbers are 8 and 12 as they do not appear on this list of areas.
