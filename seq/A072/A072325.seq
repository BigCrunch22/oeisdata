%N A072325 Number of even numbers that cannot be expressed as the difference p-q of two odd primes q < p <= prime(n).
%C A072325 If a(n)=0, then Prime[n], called a cluster prime, is in A038134. If a(n)>0 then Prime[n] is in A038133.

%e A072325 a(25)=1 because Prime[25]=97 and there is 1 even number, 88, that cannot be written as the difference of two odd primes less than or equal to 97.
