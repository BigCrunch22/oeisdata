%N A072445 Number of subsets S of the power set P{1,2,...,n} such that: {1}, {2},..., {n} are all elements of S; {1,2,...,n} is an element of S; if X and Y are elements of S and X and Y have a nonempty intersection, then the union of X and Y is an element of S. The sets S are counted modulo permutations on the elements 1,2,...,n.
%C A072445 We define a connectedness system to be a set of finite nonempty sets (edges) that is closed under taking the union of any two overlapping edges. It is connected if it is empty or contains an edge with all the vertices. Then a(n) is the number of unlabeled connected connectedness systems without singletons on n vertices. - _Gus Wiseman_, Aug 01 2019

%e A072445 a(3) = 4 because of the 4 sets: {{1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2, 3}}; {{1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}}; {{1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}; {{1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}.
%Y A072445 The non-connected case is A072444.
%Y A072445 The labeled case is A072447.
%Y A072445 The case with singletons is A326869.
