%N A072447 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) = number of families of subsets of {1, ..., n} that contain both the universe and the empty set, are closed under union of nondisjoint sets, and contain no singletons.
%C A072447 The old definition was: "Number of subsets S of the power set P{1,2,...,n} such that: {1}, {2},..., {n} are all elements of S; {1,2,...n} is an element of S; if X and Y are elements of S and X and Y have a nonempty intersection, then the union of X and Y is an element of S."
%C A072447 Comments on the old definition from _Gus Wiseman_, Aug 01 2019 (Start):
%C A072447  If this sequence were defined similarly to A326877, we would have a(1) = 0.
%C A072447 We define a connectedness system to be a set of finite nonempty sets (edges) that is closed under taking the union of any two overlapping edges. It is connected if it is empty or contains an edge with all the vertices. a(n) is the number of connected connectedness systems on n vertices without singletons. For example, the a(3) = 8 connected connectedness systems without singletons are:
%C A072447   {{1,2,3}}
%C A072447   {{1,2},{1,2,3}}
%C A072447   {{1,3},{1,2,3}}
%C A072447   {{2,3},{1,2,3}}
%C A072447   {{1,2},{1,3},{1,2,3}}
%C A072447   {{1,2},{2,3},{1,2,3}}
%C A072447   {{1,3},{2,3},{1,2,3}}
%C A072447   {{1,2},{1,3},{2,3},{1,2,3}}

%C A072447 Conjecture concerning the original definition: a(n) is also the number of families of subsets of {1, ..., n} that contain both the universe and the empty set, are closed under intersection and contain no sets of cardinality n-1. - _Tian Vlasic_, Nov 04 2022. [This was false, as pointed out by _Christian Sievers_, Oct 20 2023. The new definition makes it clear that the conjecture does not hold. See the Sievers link. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Oct 21 2023]
