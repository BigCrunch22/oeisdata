%N A072454 Number of nontotients in the reduced residue system of 2n-1.
%e A072454 n=105: phi(105) = 48 with 24 odd, 24 even terms in reduced residue system, of which 9 even terms and (all but 1) odd term is nontotient: a([105+1]/2)=a(53)=24-1+9=32. n=21: reduced residue system[21]=Union[{1,5,11,13,17,19},{2,4,8,16,20}] includes 6 odd and 5 even numbers. No even nontotients terms in reduced residue system[21], so 6-1=5 odd terms give all nontotients, so a([21+1]/2)=a(11)=5.
