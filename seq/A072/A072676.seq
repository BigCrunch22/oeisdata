%N A072676 Numbers k for which the prime circle problem has a solution composed of disjoint subsets: the arrangement of numbers 1 through 2k around a circle is such that the sum of each pair of adjacent numbers is prime, the odd numbers are in order and the even numbers are in groups of decreasing sequences.
%C A072676 This is a generalization of A072618. The integer k is in this sequence if either (a) 4k-1 and 2k+1 are prime, or (b) 2k+2i-1, 2k+2i+1 and 2i+1 are prime for some 0 < i < k. The Mathematica program computes a prime circle for such k. It is very easy to show that there are prime circles for large k, such as 10^10.

%e A072676 k=10 is a term because one solution is {1, 2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 7, 4, 9, 20, 11, 18, 13, 16, 15, 14, 17, 12, 19, 10} and the even numbers are in three decreasing sequences {2}, {8, 6, 4} and {20, 18, 16, 14, 12, 10}. Note that this solution contains {1, 2} and {1, 2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 7, 4}, which are solutions for k=1 and k=4.
