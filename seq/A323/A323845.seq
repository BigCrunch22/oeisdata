%N A323845 Number of inequivalent height 1 degree n polynomials with nonzero constant term.
%C A323845 A height 1 degree n polynomial p(x) is considered equivalent to -p(x), p(-x), x^n * p(1/x). Together, these transformations (polynomial negation, variable negation, variable inversion) generate an equivalence relationship among height 1 degree n polynomials with nonzero constant term. Two equivalent polynomials have equivalent factorizations.
%C A323845 If we consider only monic polynomials, equivalence classes can comprise 1, 2, or 4 different polynomials.
%C A323845 Proof for n = 2k+1: There are 2*3^2k monic degree n height 1 polynomials with nonzero constant term. Of those, 2*3^k are transformed to themselves by p(0)*x^n*p(1/x). For odd degree monic polynomials, that is the only equivalence transformation that has a fixed point. The number of equivalence classes is thus 2*3^k/2 + (2*3^2k-2*3^k)/4 = 3^k*(3^k+1)/2.
%C A323845 Proof for n = 2k+2:
%C A323845 Let T be the set of monic height 1 degree-n polynomials with nonzero constant term.
%C A323845 Let V be the subset for which p(0)*x^n*p(1/x) = p(x).
%C A323845 Let N be the subset for which p(-x) = p(x).
%C A323845 Let G be the subset for which p(0)*x^n*p(-1/x) = p(x).
%C A323845 Let A be the intersection of V, N, and G.
%C A323845 A comprises the elements of T in 1-element equivalence classes.
%C A323845 V-A, N-A, and G-A are disjoint. Their union comprises the elements of T in 2-element equivalence classes.
%C A323845 The remaining element of T are those in 4-element equivalence classes.
%C A323845 The number of equivalence classes is |A| + (|V-A|+|N-A|+|G-A|)/2 + |T-A-(V-A)-(N-A)-(G-A)|/4 = |A|+(|V|+|N|+|G|-3|A|)/2 + (|T|-|V|-|N|-|G|+2|A|)/4 = (|T|+|V|+|N|+|G|)/4.
%C A323845 It is not hard to show |T|=2*3^(2k+1), |V|=|G| = 4*3^k and |N| = 2*3^k. Then we have (|T|-|V|-|N|-|G|)/4 = 3^k*(3^(k+1)+2+1+2)/2 = 3^k*(3^(k+1)+5)/2.

%e A323845 For n = 2, the degree 2 height 1 polynomials with nonzero constant term are x^2-x-1, x^2-x+1, x^2-1, x^2+1, x^2+x-1, x^2+x+1, and their (equivalent) negatives. x^2-x-1 is equivalent to x^2+x-1 (either by variable negation or a combination of variable inversion and polynomial negation), and x^2-x+1 is equivalent to x^2+x+1 (by variable negation), while x^2+1 and x^2-1 are each (together with their negative) in their own equivalence class, so a(2) = 4.
