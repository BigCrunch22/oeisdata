%N A323845 For each n >= 2, the number of solutions per geometric iteration of increasingly nearly cube-congruent n-dimension hyper-rectangular solids, where sides and diagonal are all integer length and side lengths vary by <= 1.
%C A323845 Only applies to nonsquare n; squares are represented by 0 in this sequence.
%e A323845 For n=2 (2 dimensions), there is only one configuration for increasingly nearly isosceles Pythagorean right triangles: s,s+1,d; and because the series of these triangles does grow geometrically, a(2)=1.
%e A323845 For n=3 (3 dimensions), there are 2 possible configurations: s,s+1,s+1,d and s,s,s+1,d; and the valid solutions happen to alternate between these and each pair grows geometrically, so a(3)=2.
%e A323845 n=4 is a square so it forms no geometric pattern and is set to a(4)=0.
%e A323845 For n=5 (5 dimensions) there are 4 possible configurations, but only two of them produce valid solutions; these also alternate and grow geometrically as a pair, so a(5)=2.
%e A323845 For n=6 (6 dimensions) there are 5 possible configurations, and they form a pattern of 6 valid solutions before the pattern starts to repeat and grow geometrically; even though particular configurations appear multiple times in the pattern, this sequence is concerned with the total solution count per pattern, therefore a(6)=6.
