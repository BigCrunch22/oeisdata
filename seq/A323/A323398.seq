%N A323398 Lexicographically first 3-free sequence on nonnegative integers not containing the Stanley sequence S(0,1), which is A005836.
%C A323398 Consider the lexicographically earliest sequence of nonnegative numbers that does not contain the arithmetic mean of any pair of terms (such sequences are called 3-free sequences as they do not contain 3-term arithmetic progressions): 0,1,3,4 and so on. This sequence is Stanley sequence S(0,1). Remove numbers in the Stanley sequence from nonnegative integers and repeat the process of finding the earliest 3-free sequence. The result is this sequence.
%C A323398 When written in base three these are numbers that contain exactly one 2 that might be followed by zeros.

%e A323398 Removing the Stanley sequence from nonnegative integers we get sequence A074940:  2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 (Numbers having at least one 2 in their ternary representation). Our new sequence starts with 2,5,6. It can't contain 7 as 5,6,7 form an arithmetic progression. It can't contain 8 as 2,5,8 form an arithmetic progression. The next term is 11.
