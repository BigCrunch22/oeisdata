%N A323382 a(n) is the period of the oscillating pattern formed by a diagonal line of 2*n cells in the Life-like cellular automaton B2e3ijkn4cz5/S236.
%C A323382 An explanation of the Hensel notation used to define the cellular automaton rule can be found on the LifeWiki (see links).
%C A323382 Lines of odd lengths are excluded because they break up into patterns not consisting of diagonal lines.
%C A323382 These diagonal line oscillators are effectively emulating a four-state one-dimensional cellular automaton.
%C A323382 From _Charlie Neder_, Feb 12 2019: (Start)
%C A323382 Specifically, such an oscillator with 2*n cells is isomorphic to a row of 2*n state-1 cells that evolve according to the following rules:
%C A323382 1) A state-1 cell becomes state-3 if it has a state-1 neighbor, and state-2 otherwise,
%C A323382 2) A state-2 cell becomes state-1 unconditionally,
%C A323382 3) A state-3 cell becomes state-1 if both its neighbors are state-3, and state-2 otherwise. (End)

%F A323382 If n == 2 (mod 4), a(n) = 3.
%e A323382 a(4) = 5 because a diagonal line of 8 cells oscillates with period 5 in this cellular automaton.
