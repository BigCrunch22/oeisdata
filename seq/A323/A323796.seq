%N A323796 Numbers (both the reverse and the add numbers) occurring in the Reverse and Add! graph with seed 196.
%C A323796 The graph has a tree structure with reversed edges. The tree structure is in fact a branched horsetail (a botanical term). The vertices are pairs (Added number and its Reverse). Both the Add as well as the Reverse terms are included in the sequence.
%C A323796 Each term in the sequence represents the number (either Added or Reversed) of the tail of the edge of the directed graph, lexicographical ordered by first the head of its edge and second the tail of the edge. The heads in the graph are the numbers in A006960.
%C A323796 In general, a(n) for n = A323797(m)..A323797(m+1)-1 point to A006960(m) for m > 0; for example: a(n) for n = 1..8 point to A006960(1) and a(n) for n = 9..12 point to A006960(2).
%C A323796 The structure seems is somewhat surprising:
%C A323796 a(1)..a(8) is given by 97 + 99*n0 for n0 = 0..7;
%C A323796 a(9)..a(12) is given by 689 + 99*n0 for n0 = 0..3
%C A323796 a(13)..a(54) is given by 496 + 90*n0 + 999*n1 for n0 = 0..5 and n1 = 0..6;
%C A323796 a(55)..a(102) is given by 4079 + 90*n0 + 999*n1 for n0 = 0..7 and n1 = 0..5;
%C A323796 a(103)..a(142) is given by 2794 + 90*n0 + 999*n1 for n0 = 0..7 and n1 = 0..4;
%C A323796 a(143)..a(182) is given by 539 + 990*n0 + 9999*n1 for n0 = 0..3 and n1 = 0..9;
%C A323796 a(183)..a(190) is given by 97009 + 990*n0 for n0 = 0..7;
%C A323796 a(191)..a(430) is given by 70799 + 900*n0 + 9990*n1 + 99999*n2 for n0 = 0..7, n1 = 0..2 and n2 = 0..8;
%C A323796 a(431)..a(744) is given by 1057969 + 9900*n0 + 99990*n1 + 999990*n2 for n0 = 0..7, n1 = 0..8 and n2 = 0..8, where (n0,n1,n2) = (2,3,4) must be excluded due to the fact that it results in a palindrome, 5377735.
