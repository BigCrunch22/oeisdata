%N A323733 Numbers k for which there exists at least one number j > 1 such that j^k has exactly j divisors.
%C A323733 Complement of A323732.
%C A323733 This sequence lists the numbers k such that A073049(k) > 0.
%C A323733 Equivalently:
%C A323733 numbers k for which 1 is not the only number j such that j^k has exactly j divisors;
%C A323733 numbers k such that A323731(k) > 1;
%C A323733 numbers k such that A323734(k) > 1.
%e A323733 For k=9 and j=640, j^k = 640^9 = (2^7 * 5)^9 = 2^63 * 5^9, which has exactly (63+1)*(9+1) = 64*10 = 640 = j divisors, so k=9 is a term.
%e A323733 There exists no j > 1 such that j^14 has exactly j divisors, so 14 is not a term.
