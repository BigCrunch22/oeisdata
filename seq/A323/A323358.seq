%N A323358 Number of distinct automorphism group sizes for binary self-dual codes of length 2n such that multiple same length binary self-dual codes with different weight distributions share the same automorphism group size.
%C A323358 Two codes are said to be permutation equivalent if permuting the columns of one code results in the other code.
%C A323358 If permuting the columns of a code results in the same identical code the permutation is called an automorphism.
%C A323358 The automorphisms of a code form a group called the automorphism group.
%C A323358 Some codes have automorphism groups that contain the same number of elements.  There are situations, both trivial and otherwise, that codes of different lengths can have the same size automorphism groups.
%C A323358 Some codes have automorphism group sizes that are unique to the code for a given length.
%C A323358 There are instances where more than one code can share the same automorphism group size yet have different weight distributions (weight enumerator). This sequence provides the number of automorphism group sizes where this is true for a given length.

%e A323358 There are a(18) = 535 automorphism group sizes for the binary self-dual codes of length 2*18 = 36 where codes having different weight distributions share the same automorphism group size.
