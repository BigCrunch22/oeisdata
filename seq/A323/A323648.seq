%N A323648 Numbers k such that the largest Dyck path of the symmetric representation of sigma(k) does not share any line segment with the largest Dyck path of the symmetric representation of sigma(k+1).
%C A323648 Equivalently, numbers k such that in the perspective view of the stepped pyramid described in A245092, the steps of the n-th level do not share any vertical face with the steps of the level n + 1, starting from the top of the pyramid.
%C A323648 a(2) = 2 is the only even number in the sequence.
