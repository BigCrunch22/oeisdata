%S A323389 1,2,5,19,88,553
%N A323389 The number of connected, unlabeled, undirected, edge-signed cubic graphs (admitting loops and multiedges) on 2n vertices where the degree of the first sign is 2 at each node.
%C A323389 Obtained from the cubic graphs A005967 (connected undirected cubic graphs that may have loops and/or multiedges) by signing each edge with a plus or a minus such that two pluses and one minus meet at each vertex.

%Y A323389 Cf. A005967 (unsigned), A054499 (only one cycle of pluses), A170946 (directed plus-edges).
