%N A323421 Lexicographically earliest sequence of terms describing its successive chunks of different digits.
%C A323421 Put a vertical stroke between two identical digits; those strokes delimitate a succession of chunks whose sizes are given by the sequence itself.
%C A323421 There is only one integer 10 in the sequence.
%C A323421 The other integers up to a(28445) are 1 (with 7940 copies), 2 (with 6904 copies), 3 (with 6157 copies), 4 (with 3706 copies), 5 (with 2091 copies), 6 (with 1065 copies), 7 (with 445 copies), 8 (with 123 copies) and 9 (with only 14 copies).

%e A323421 The stroke technique transforms the sequence into 1 | 10,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 | 9,1 | 1,2,3 | 3,1,2,4 |... and we see indeed that the chunks of different digits have sizes 1, 10, 2, 3, 4, ...
