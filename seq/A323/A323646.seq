%N A323646 "Letter A" toothpick sequence (see Comments for precise definition).
%C A323646 This arises from a hybrid cellular automaton formed of toothpicks of length 2 and D-toothpicks of length 2*sqrt(2).
%C A323646 For the construction of the sequence the rules are as follows:
%C A323646 On the infinite square grid at stage 0 there are no toothpicks, so a(0) = 0.
%C A323646 For the next n generations we have that:
%C A323646 At stage 1 we place a toothpick of length 2 in the horizontal direction, centered at [0,0], so a(1) = 1.
%C A323646 If n is even we add D-toothpicks. Each new D-toothpick must have its midpoint touching the endpoint of exactly one existing toothpick.
%C A323646 If the x-coordinate of the middle point of the D-toothpick is negative then the D-toothpick must be placed in the NE-SW direction.
%C A323646 If the x-coordinate of the middle point of the D-toothpick is positive then the D-toothpick must be placed in the NW-SE direction.
%C A323646 If n is odd we add toothpicks in horizontal direction. Each new toothpick must have its midpoint touching the endpoint of exactly one existing D-toothpick.
%C A323646 The sequence gives the number of toothpicks and D-toothpicks after n stages.
%C A323646 A323647 (the first differences) gives the number of elements added at the n-th stage.
%C A323646 Note that if n >> 1 at the end of every cycle the structure looks like a "volcano", or in other words, the structure looks like a trapeze which is almost an isosceles right triangle.
%C A323646 The "word" of this cellular automaton is "ab". For more information about the word of cellular automata see A296612.

%F A323646 a(n) = 1 + A160730(n-1), n >= 1.
%F A323646 a(n) = 1 + 2*A168112(n-1), n >= 1.
%e A323646 After two generations the structure looks like a letter "A" which is formed by a initial I-toothpick (or a toothpick of length 2), placed in horizontal direction, and two D-toothpicks each of length 2*sqrt(2) as shown below, so a(2) = 3.
%e A323646 Note that angle between both D-toothpicks is 90 degrees.
