%N A323699 Number of uncrossed knight's walks as specified in A323700, counting isomorphisms only once.
%C A323699 First differs at a(7)=404 from A323700(7)=406, because there are two walks of length 7 trapped at both ends. If seen as unrooted walks, their path shapes become identical after path reversal and reflection.
