%N A323737 Decimal expansion of the limit of (Sum_{j=1..k} j*arcsin(1/j)) - k as k approaches infinity.
%C A323737 Draw a set of circular arcs, with each arc having its center at the origin and drawn so that it connects the line x=1 to the positive y-axis, and with the j-th arc having radius j; i.e., draw
%C A323737 - the 1st arc from (1, 0)       to (0, 1),
%C A323737 - the 2nd arc from (1, sqrt(3)) to (0, 2),
%C A323737 - the 3rd arc from (1, sqrt(8)) to (0, 3),
%C A323737 ...
%C A323737 - the k-th arc from (1, sqrt(k^2 - 1)) to (0, k).
%C A323737 Let alpha(k) be the angle covered by the k-th arc: the first arc is a quarter circle, so alpha(1) = Pi/2; alpha(2) = arcsin(1/2) = 0.523598...; alpha(3) = arcsin(1/3) = 0.339836...; and, in general, alpha(k) = arcsin(1/k). The length of the k-th arc is k*alpha(k) = k*arcsin(1/k), which approaches 1 as k increases.
%C A323737 The total length of the first k arcs is then t(k) = Sum_{j=1..k} j*alpha(j) = Sum_{j=1..k} j*arcsin(1/j), which equals k + C - (1/6)/k + (1/12)/k^2 - (19/360)/k^3 + (3/80)/k^4 - (143/5040)/k^5 + (5/224)/k^6 - (731/40320)/k^7 + (35/2304)/k^8 - (4949/380160)/k^9 + (63/5632)/k^10 - ... where C = 0.685385... is the constant whose decimal expansion consists of the terms of this sequence.
