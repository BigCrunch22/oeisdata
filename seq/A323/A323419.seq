%N A323419 The fourth greedy 3-free sequence on nonnegative integers.
%C A323419 Consider the lexicographically earliest sequence of nonnegative integers that does not contain the arithmetic mean of any pair of terms (such sequences are called 3-free sequences as they do not contain 3-term arithmetic progressions): 0,1,3,4 and so on. This sequence is Stanley sequence S(0,1). Remove numbers in the Stanley sequence from nonnegative integers and repeat the process of finding the next earliest 3-free sequence, which is sequence A323398. The next iteration produces sequence A323418. The fourth iteration produces this sequence.
%C A323419 When represented in ternary this sequence consists of integers ending in 10, 11, 20 or 21, and there is exactly one digit 2 before that that might be followed by zeros.
