%N A323732 Numbers k for which there exists no j > 1 such that j^k has exactly j divisors.
%C A323732 This sequence lists the numbers k such that A073049(k) = 0.
%C A323732 Equivalently:
%C A323732 numbers k for which the only number j such that j^k has exactly j divisors is 1;
%C A323732 numbers k such that A323731(k)=1;
%C A323732 numbers k such that A323734(k)=1.
%C A323732 The complement of this sequence is A323733.
%C A323732 The next terms after a(24)=230 appear to be 233, 253, 269, 273, 285, 293, 303, 307, 318, 321, 328, 345, 354, 357, 369, 370, 373, 384, 393, 402, 410, 412, 414, 426, 429, 431, 440, 441, 445, 468, ...
%e A323732 There exists no j > 1 such that j^5 has exactly j divisors, so 5 is a term.
%e A323732 For k=15 and j=976, j^k = 976^15 = (2^4 * 61)^15 = 2^60 * 61^15, which has exactly (60+1)*(15+1) = 61*16 = 976 = j divisors, so k=15 is not a term.
%Y A323732 Cf. A000005, A073049, A323730, A323731, A323733, A323734.
