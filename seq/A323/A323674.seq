%N A323674 Square array, read by antidiagonals, of the positive integers 6cd +-c +-d = (6c +- 1)d +- c. Alternate rows (or columns) are numbers that differ by c from multiples of 6c - 1 or 6c + 1.
%C A323674 This sequence without duplicates is A067611, which is the complement of A002822, the positive integers x for which 6x - 1 and 6x + 1 are twin primes.
%F A323674 a(m,n) = 6*floor((m+1)/2)*floor((n+1)/2) + ((-1)^n)*floor((m+1)/2) + ((-1)^m)*floor((n+1)/2), m,n >= 1.
