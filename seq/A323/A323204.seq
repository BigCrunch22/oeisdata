%N A323204 A variant of the Syracuse-like routine visible in A323175, avoiding duplicates (and loops). See the Comments section.
%C A323204 Here is the original 4-step routine:
%C A323204 (1) Start with any integer > 0
%C A323204 (2) Add 1 and print
%C A323204 (3) If the result is a composite number go to (2), otherwise go to (4)
%C A323204 (4) Reverse the digits of the result and go to (2)
%C A323204 In this variant, if the above routine produces a duplicate, we replace this duplicate with the smallest integer not yet present in the sequence, print it and go to the instruction (2).
%C A323204 This sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.
%H A323204 Jean-Marc Falcoz, <a href="/A323204/b323204.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..10001</a>
%e A323204 This sequence differs from A323175 by construction as A323175 is finite, ending with a(143) = 809; this sequence shares the same 143 first terms, then a(144) = 14 (as 14 is the smallest integer not yet present in the sequence), etc.
%Y A323204 Cf. A323175 (the original Syracuse-like routine explained).
