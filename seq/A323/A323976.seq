%N A323976 Records for the number of 'Reverse and Add' steps, needed for a Lychrel number to join the trajectory of a smaller Lychrel number (i.e., its seed).
%C A323976 Similar to the number of steps needed to reach a palindrome in the Reverse and Add! trajectories (see A065198 and A065199), the number of steps needed for a Lychrel number to reach the trajectory of its seed is relatively small.
%Y A323976 Cf. A065198, A065199, A323975.
