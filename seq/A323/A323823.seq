%N A323823 Lexicographically first sequence starting with a(1) = 1, with no duplicate term, such that a(n) is the result of a self-additive linear combination of its own digits (concatenated sometimes into substrings).
%C A323823 A linear combination is an operation like a*u + b*v + c*w + d*x + ... = N. [We want only (+) signs here, thus the word "additive" in the definition.] The coefficients a, b, c, d,... and u, v, w, x,... are determined by the digits of a(n) itself, concatenated sometimes into substrings (no substring with a leading zero is allowed). No digit belongs to more than one substring and all digits are involved in the linear combination.
%C A323823 Some patterns are distinguishable:
%C A323823 a(1067) = 138614 --- 13 86 14
%C A323823 a(1068) = 148515 --- 14 85 15
%C A323823 a(1069) = 158416 --- 15 84 16
%C A323823 a(1070) = 168317 --- 16 83 17
%C A323823 a(1071) = 178218 --- 17 82 18
%C A323823 a(1072) = 188119 --- 18 81 19
%C A323823 a(1073) = 198020 --- 19 80 20
%C A323823 a(1074) = 207921 --- 20 79 21
%C A323823 a(1075) = 217822 --- 21 78 22

%e A323823 a(1) = 1 belongs to the sequence as 1 = 1*1 [the digits appearing to the left of the (*) sign rebuild a(n); the same is true with the digits appearing to the right of the (*) sign];
%e A323823 10 does not belong to the sequence as 10 = 10*1 + 0*0, although being true, involves 5 digits instead of 4;
%e A323823 36 does not belong to the sequence as 36 = 3*6 + 6*3, although being true and involving 4 digits, doesn't respect the order in which the digits should appear in the linear combination;
%e A323823 a(2) = 100 belongs to the sequence as 100 = 10*10 + 0*0;
%e A323823 a(3) = 101 belongs to the sequence as 101 = 10*10 + 1*1;
%e A323823 a(4) = 143 belongs to the sequence as 143 = 14*1 + 3*43;
%e A323823 a(5) = 182 belongs to the sequence as 182 = 18*1 + 2*82;
%e A323823 etc.
