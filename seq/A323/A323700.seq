%N A323700 Number of rooted uncrossed knight's walks on an infinite chessboard trapped after n moves with first move specified.
%C A323700 Trapping occurs if the walk cannot be continued without reusing an already visited field or creating an intersection of the path segments formed by straight lines connecting consecutively visited fields.
%C A323700 The shortest self-trapped walk has 4 moves, i.e., a(n)=0 for n < 4.
%e A323700 a(4) = 1 because there is only one trapped walk of 4 moves, written in algebraic chess notation: (N) b1 d2 b3 a1 c2.
%e A323700 For longer walks see link to illustrations in A323699.
%Y A323700 Cf. A003192, A323131, A323559, A323560, A323699.
