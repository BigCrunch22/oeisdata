%N A323180 Row sums of A323179.
%C A323180 Sums of triangle rows of the rule 30 automaton, in which the execution of the rule has been modified as such:
%C A323180 In the rule 30 CA, local cell neighborhoods are converted into a number 0-7, which is then used to determine if the central cell will be active in the next generation of the CA.
%C A323180 For this version, when determining this local neighborhood number, any positive nonzero value is treated as a Boolean TRUE. 0 values operate the same way as the conventional version of rule 30.
%C A323180 For example: [0],[0],[14] becomes [False],[False],[True] for the purposes of determining the local state.
%C A323180 Second, instead of writing a 1 when instructed by the 8 sub-rules, instead write the sum of the three local cells.
