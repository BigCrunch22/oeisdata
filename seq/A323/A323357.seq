%N A323357 Number of binary self-dual codes of length 2n (up to permutation equivalence) that have a unique automorphism group size.
%C A323357 Two codes are said to be permutation equivalent if permuting the columns of one code results in the other code.
%C A323357 If permuting the columns of a code results in the same identical code the permutation is called an automorphism.
%C A323357 The automorphisms of a code form a group called the automorphism group.
%C A323357 Some codes have automorphism groups that contain the same number of elements.  There are situations, both trivial and otherwise, that codes of different lengths can have the same size automorphism groups.
%C A323357 Some codes have automorphism group sizes that are unique to the code. This sequence only compares automorphism group sizes for codes with the same length.

%e A323357 There are a(18) = 212 binary self-dual codes (up to permutation equivalence) of length 2*18 = 36 that have a unique automorphism group size.
