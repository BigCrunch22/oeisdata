%N A323734 a(n) is the largest number j whose n-th power has exactly j divisors.
%C A323734 a(n) is the largest (and last) of the A323731(n) numbers in row n of A323730.
%C A323734 If a(n)=1 then n is a term in A323732; otherwise, n is a term in A323733.

%e A323734 The numbers j whose 3rd powers have exactly j divisors are 1, 28, and 40; the largest of these is 40, so a(3) = 40.
%e A323734 The only number j whose 5th power has exactly j divisors is 1, so a(1) = 1.
