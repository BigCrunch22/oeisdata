%N A323738 Decimal expansion of lim_{k->infinity} (-k - (1/6)*log(k) + Sum_{j=1..k} sqrt(j)*arcsin(1/sqrt(j))).
%C A323738 Consider the curve lying between the positive x-axis and the line y=1 and generated by the following process for k = 1, 2, 3, ...: Draw a circular arc about the origin from (sqrt(k-1), 1) down to (sqrt(k), 0), then draw a vertical line segment from there up to (sqrt(k), 1).
%C A323738 After the k-th arc and line segment have been drawn, the length of the curve is k + Sum_{j=1..k} sqrt(j)*arcsin(1/sqrt(j)) = 2k + (1/6)*log(k) + C + (1/120)/k + (13/10080)/k^2 - (37/120960)/k^3 - (617/3548160)/k^4 + (8719/98841600)/k^5 + (47623/553512960)/k^6 - ... where C = 0.561549... is the constant whose decimal expansion consists of the terms of this sequence.
