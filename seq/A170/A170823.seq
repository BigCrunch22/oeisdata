%N A170823 An infinite word on the alphabet 1, 2, 3 by Bollobas.
%C A170823 A concatenation of blocks u_k, k >= 0, where u_k has length 5^k. The sequence is defined recursively - see the Maple code.
%C A170823 From _Kevin Ryde_, Aug 11 2020: (Start)
%C A170823 Bollobás gives this sequence intending it to be a squarefree ternary word, where squarefree means nowhere a repeat w w for a block w of any length.  However, squares do occur in it, for example a(18) onwards is 3212 3212, or a(19) onwards is 2123 2123.
%C A170823 In Bollobás' proof, the signs sequence is A337004.  For blocks w of length l=4, the second signs subsequence presented (which should stop at length 7), does in fact occur, as does one other.
%C A170823   - - +  +  - - +    \ two l=4 signs subsequences
%C A170823   - + +  -  - + +    / in A337004 making squares here
%C A170823 All else in the argument holds, and in particular the "peaks" reduction means the only squares are lengths l = 4*5^k.
%C A170823 Zolotov shows this word is cubefree, and weakly squarefree (no x w w x where x is a single symbol and w is a block, possibly empty).  However uniform cyclic squarefree must wait for Leech's order 13 morphism in A337005.
