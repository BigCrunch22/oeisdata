%N A362191 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct nonnegative integers having the same concatenation of digits as the sequence 2^a(n).
%C A362191 We conjecture that this is a permutation of the nonnegative integers, but a proof seems without reach. Can it be disproved?
%C A362191 The sequence extends greedily to infinity, i.e., without backtracking, always choosing a(n) as the smallest possible term compatible with the digits given so far, and not leaving a 0 as next digit to be the initial digit of a future term a(n'), once 0 has been used, or of 2^a(n').
%e A362191 The first term a(0) must start with the same digits as 2^a(0), the smallest solution is a(0) = 6 with 2^a(0) = 64.
%e A362191 Then the next digit must be 4, and we can indeed choose a(1) = 4 with 2^a(1) = 16.
%e A362191 Then the next digit must be 1, and we can indeed choose a(2) = 1 with 2^a(2) = 2.
%e A362191 Then the next digit must be 6 (last digit of 2^a(1)), but since 6 = a(0) is already used, we have to consider a(3) with at least two digits, the second of which must be 2 from 2^a(2). We can indeed choose a(3) = 62 with 2^a(3) = 4611686018427387904.
%e A362191 Then the next digits must be 4 and 6 from 2^a(3). Since 4 = a(1) is already used, we must choose a(4) = 46 with 2^a(4) = 70368744177664.
%e A362191 Then the next digits must be two 1s, still from 2^a(3). Since 1 = a(2) is already used, we must choose a(5) = 11 with 2^a(5) = 2048.
%e A362191 Then the next digits must be 6 and 8, still from 2^a(3). Since 6 = a(0) is already used, we must choose a(6) = 68 with 2^a(6) = 295147905179352825856.
%e A362191 Then the next digits must be 6 and 0, still from 2^a(3). Since 6 = a(0) is already used, we must choose a(7) = 60 with 2^a(7) = 1152921504606846976.
%e A362191 After a(13) = 79, the next term must start with a digit 0, and we can indeed choose a(14) = 0.
%e A362191 However, thereafter the next three digits must be 4, 7 and 0, and although 47 did not occur earlier, we cannot make this choice since that would require the next term to start with a digit 0, which is now impossible, as 0 already has occurred. Therefore we must choose a(15) = 470.
