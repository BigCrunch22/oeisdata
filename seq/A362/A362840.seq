%N A362840 a(n) is the smallest number x between 1 and n-1 for which the number 1/x achieves the longest cycle of repeating digits in its expansion in base n.
%C A362840 Terminating expansions, in any base, are considered to have a cycle period of length 0.
%C A362840 It appears by observation that all terms in the sequence are either primes or powers of primes.
%e A362840 a(3)=2 since in base 3, 1/2 is represented by 0.111... with a cycle of 1 repeating digit, which is the longest cycle among 1/x for x = 1..2.
%e A362840 a(10)=7 since in base 10, 1/7 is represented by 0.142857... with a cycle of 6 repeating digits, which is the longest cycle among 1/x for x = 1..9.
%Y A362840 Cf. A362865 (corresponding cycle lengths).
%Y A362840 Cf. A051626.
