%N A362207 a(n) is the number of unordered triples of shortest nonintersecting grid paths joining two opposite corners of an n X n X n grid.
%C A362207 An n X n X n grid is a cube with (n+1)^3 grid points. Each of the three paths has 3*n steps and they intersect only at the start and at the end. Initially, each path will start by moving along distinct coordinate axes.
%Y A362207 The two-dimensional version of this sequence is A000891(n-1).
