%N A362466 First occurrence of n in A362465 or -1 if n is not a term in A362465.
%C A362466 All terms a(n) for even n > 4 are conjectures and conjectured to be -1. This follows from the reason derived from Polignac's conjecture that is described in A362465.
%C A362466 The requirements for the truth of the above conjecture about this sequence seem to be notably weaker than for Polignac's conjecture.
%e A362466 a(5) = 29 because it is the least number that cannot be expressed as a sum of more than 1 and fewer than 5 consecutive signed primes. The example in A362465 shows that there is a solution for 29 with 5 consecutive signed primes, but not with more than 1 and fewer than 5.
