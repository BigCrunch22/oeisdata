%N A362248 a(n) is the number of locations 1..n-1 which can reach i=n-1, where jumps from location i to i +- a(i) are permitted (within 1..n-1); a(1)=1. See example.
%C A362248 Note that location n-1 itself is counted as a term which can reach i=n-1.

%e A362248 a(6)=5 because there are 5 starting terms from which i=5 can be reached:
%e A362248 1, 1, 2, 3, 1
%e A362248 1->1->2---->1
%e A362248 We can see that indexes 1,2,3 and trivially 5 can reach i=5. i=4 can also reach i=5 as follows:
%e A362248 1, 1, 2, 3, 1
%e A362248 1<-------3
%e A362248 1->1->2---->1
%e A362248 This is a total of 5 locations, so a(6)=5.
