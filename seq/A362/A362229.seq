%N A362229 a(n) is the largest m such that uphi(m) = n, where uphi is the unitary totient function (A047994), or a(n) = 0 if no such m exists.

%F A362229 a(A347771(n)) = 0.
%e A362229 a(1) = 2 since there are two solutions to uphi(x) = 1: 1 and 2, and 2 is the larger of them.
%e A362229 a(6) = 14 since there are three solutions to uphi(x) = 6: 7, 12 and 14, and 14 is the largest of them.
