%N A362977 The x-coordinates of the even-ranked elements of the lexicographically earliest sequence of points satisfying staircase and no-three-in-a-line conditions (see comments).
%C A362977 We construct the lexicographically earliest sequence of points M(i), for i >= 0, with the following rules:
%C A362977 - their (x, y) coordinates are taken among the nonnegative integers;
%C A362977 - if i > 0 and i is odd, then "move horizontally to a free column"; i.e., M(i) must have the same y as M(i-1), and M(i) is not allowed to have the same x as any M(k) for k < i;
%C A362977 - if i > 0 and i is even, then "move vertically to a free row"; i.e., M(i) must have the same x as M(i-1), and M(i) is not allowed to have the same y as any M(k) for k < i;
%C A362977 - three points are not allowed to be aligned.
%C A362977 See SVG illustration, Links section.
%C A362977 Then a(n) (resp. A362978(n)) is defined as the x-coordinate (resp. y-coordinate) of M(i), where i := 2n (to eliminate duplicates).
