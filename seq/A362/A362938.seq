%N A362938 a(n) = minimum number of pieces needed to dissect a regular n-sided polygon into a polygonal tile which tiles the plane (conjectured).
%C A362938 I do not know which of these values have been proved to be minimal. Probably only a(n) for n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10.
%C A362938 This is an exception to the usual OEIS policy of requiring that all terms in sequences must be known exactly, but this sequence is included because of its importance and in the hope that someone will establish the truth of some of the conjectured values.
%C A362938 More formally, a(n) = minimum number of pieces needed to dissect a regular n-sided polygon into a prototile for a monohedral tiling of the plane.
%C A362938 Turning over is allowed. The pieces must be bounded by simple curves to avoid difficulties with non-measurable sets.
%C A362938 a(11) is at most 9 (Sloane and Theobald (2023), Figure 34). It is very likely that a(12) = 3.

One would expect that plates B11 and B13 would refer to n = 11 and 13, but in fact they appear to give alternative solutions for n = 10 and 12, respectively.
