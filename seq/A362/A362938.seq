%N A362938 a(n) = minimum number of pieces needed to dissect a regular n-sided polygon into a monotile, i.e. a polygonal tile which tiles the plane (conjectured).
%C A362938 I do not know which of these values have been proved to be minimal. Probably only a(n) for n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10.
%C A362938 The three related sequences A110312, A362938, A362939 are exceptions to the usual OEIS policy of requiring that all terms in sequences must be known exactly. These sequences are included because of their importance and in the hope that someone will establish the truth of some of the conjectured values.
%C A362938 More formally, a(n) = minimum number of pieces needed to dissect a regular n-sided polygon into a monotile, that is, a prototile for a monohedral tiling of the plane.
%C A362938 Turning over is allowed. The pieces must be bounded by simple curves to avoid difficulties with non-measurable sets.
%C A362938 The definitions imply that a(n) <= A362939(n) <= A110312(n).
%C A362938 On Aug 31 2023 Gavin Theobald sent me two different solutions for a(9) = 3 and one solution for a(11) = 4 (see links). He reports that he found these dissections in the 1990's. In his email and in a later email (Sep 04 2023) he also gives the values a(13) = 5, a(14) = 3, a(15) = 5 (with one piece turned over), a(16) = a(18) = 4, a(20) = 5. He conjectures that a(2t) = floor(t/2) for all t >= 2.

One would expect that plates B11 and B13 would refer to n = 11 and 13, but in fact they appear to give alternative solutions for n = 10 and 12, respectively.
