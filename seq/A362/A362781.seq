%N A362781 Natural numbers n for which some base-phi representation of n is anti-palindromic.
%C A362781 Here "anti-palindromic" means the expansion is of the form x.y, where the complement of y is the reverse of x (allowing leading or trailing zeros).  Here we do not insist that the base-phi representation be "canonical" (that is, we do not insist that xy contains no 11).

%F A362781 There is a 193-state automaton accepting the Zeckendorf representation of the members of this sequence.
%e A362781 For example, one base-phi representation of 13 is 00100001.01111011.
