%N A362872 Length of the "fractional part" of the phi-representation of n.
%C A362872 The phi-representation of n is the (essentially) unique way to write n = Sum_{j=L..R} b(j)*phi^j, where b(j) is in {0,1} and -oo < L <= 0 <= R, where phi = (1+sqrt(5))/2, subject to the condition that b(j)b(j+1) != 1. The "fractional" part is the string of bits b(L)b(L+1)...b(-1), and its length is thus L.
%C A362872 The gaps between consecutive terms are all either 0 or 2, and a gap of 2 occurs if and only if n = L(2i+1) for i >= 0.  This is equivalent to Theorem 2.1 of Sanchis and Sanchis (2001).

%F A362872 There is a linear representation of rank 11 for a(n).
%e A362872 The phi-representation of 20 is 1000010.010001, so a(20) = 6.
