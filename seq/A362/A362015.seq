%N A362015 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not yet appeared that, given the list of primes that form the factors of all previous terms a(1)..a(n-1), is a multiple of the prime in that list which is a factor of the fewest previous terms. If two or more such primes exist the smallest is chosen.
%C A362015 After 5 million terms the lowest number not to have appeared is 16 = 2^4. In that range 2 is a factor of 2614180 terms while 3 is a factor of 1763610 terms. As these are the most and second-most common prime factors this suggest that 16, and other higher powers of 2, will never appear as that would require 2 to be the least common factor of all previous terms. This is also true for the powers of the other smaller primes.
%C A362015 In the first 5 million terms the only fixed point, other than the first two terms, is 4175, although it is probable that more exist.

%e A362015 a(5) = 3 as the list of primes that divide all previous terms a(1)..a(4) is 2 and 3, with 2 being a factor of three terms and 3 being a factor of one term. Therefore a(5) is the lowest multiple of 3 that has not appeared, which is 3.
