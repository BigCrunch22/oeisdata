%N A362617 Numbers whose prime factorization has both (1) even length, and (2) unequal middle parts.
%C A362617 Also numbers n whose median prime factor is not a prime factor of n, where the median of a multiset is either the middle part (for odd length), or the average of the two middle parts (for even length).
%e A362617 The prime factorization of 60 is 2*2*3*5, with middle parts (2,3), so 60 is in the sequence.
