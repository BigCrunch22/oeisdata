%N A362622 One and numbers whose prime factorization has its greatest part at a middle position.
%e A362622 The prime factorization of 150 is 5*5*3*2, with middle parts {3,5}, so 150 is in the sequence.
%e A362622 The prime factorization of 90 is 5*3*3*2, with middle parts {3,3}, so 90 is not in the sequence.
