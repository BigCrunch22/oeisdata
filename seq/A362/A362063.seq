%N A362063 Number of 2-balanced binary words of length n with respect to the permutations of the symbols.
%C A362063 2-balanced binary words are here defined as the binary words with such property that the sum of each subblock differs by at most 2 from every other subblock of the same length.
%C A362063 Can be interpreted as a number of 2-balanced binary words with the prefix "0".
%F A362063 a(n) = A274005(n)/2 for n>0, since A274005 is the number of all binary 2-balanced words of given length.
%e A362063 a(3) = 4 since 000, 001, 010 and 011 are 2-balanced.
%e A362063 a(6) = 31 since all words of form 0XXXXX are 2-balanced, except the word 000111.
%Y A362063 A274005 is the number of all binary 2-balanced words with given length.
%Y A362063 A005598 is the number of all binary balanced (1-balanced) words with given length.
