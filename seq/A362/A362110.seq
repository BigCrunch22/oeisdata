%N A362110 a(n) is the smallest positive integer x such that n can be expressed as the arithmetic mean of x distinct squares, or 0 if x does not exist.
%C A362110 Upper bound: (a(n) + 1) * (2*a(n) + 1) <= 6*n.
%F A362110 a(A132777(n)) = 2. - _Thomas Scheuerle_, Apr 16 2023
%e A362110 For n = 2, if x = 1, 2*1 = 2 is not a square; if x = 2, 2*2 = 4 = 2^2 + 0^2 cannot be expressed as the sum of two nonzero squares; if x = 3, 2*3 = 6 = 2^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 cannot be expressed as the sum of three distinct nonzero squares. Alternatively, (Sum_{k=1..x}i^2)/x <= 2, so (x + 1) * (2*x + 1) <= 12, hence x <= 1, such x does not exist, a(2) = 0.
