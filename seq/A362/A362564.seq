%N A362564 a(n) is the largest integer x such that n + 2^x is a square, or -1 if no such number exists.
%C A362564 a(n) is the maximum integer solution x of the indefinite equation n + 2^x = r^2 where n is a constant and r is a positive integer, or -1 if there are no solutions.
%C A362564 If n == 0 (mod 4), we first try x = 0 or 1; when x >= 2, the problem is the same as where n is divided by 4.
%C A362564 If n == 2 (mod 4), the only possible values of x is 1, or n + 2^x == 2 (mod 4) which is a nonsquare.
%C A362564 If n == 3 (mod 4), the only possible values of x are 0 and 1, or n + 2^x == 3 (mod 4) which is a nonsquare.
%C A362564 If n == 1 (mod 4), or n = 4*k + 1 (k is a nonnegative integer): we suggest that r = 2*m + 1, 4*k + 1 + 2^x = (2*m + 1)^2, thus k + 2^(x - 2) = m*(m + 1); if k is odd, the only possible values of x is 2 because m*(m + 1) is even.
%C A362564 If n is a square, or n = k^2 (k is a positive integer), 2^x = (r + k)*(r - k), so 2k must be in the form 2^i - 2^j.
%C A362564 The problem can be solved via reduction to three Mordell curves: n + z^3 = y^2, n + 2z^3 = y^2 or equivalently 4n + (2z)^3 = (2y)^2, n + 4z^3 = y^2 or equivalently 16n + (4z)^3 = (4y)^2, where z := 2^floor(x/3). For a given n, each of these three curves is known to have only a finite number of integer points (y,z), proving that x cannot be unbounded. - _Max Alekseyev_, Apr 26 2023
