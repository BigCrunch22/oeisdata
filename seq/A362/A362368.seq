%C A362368 The palindrome game is a game where players take turns removing a nonempty palindrome from a binary string. The player who crosses off the last palindrome wins.
%e A362368 For n=2, 00 and 11 are not losing strings since the first player can cross out the entire string and win. 10 and 01 are losing strings since the first player has to cross out either the first or second character, leaving the second player with a string of length 1, which is always a palindrome.
