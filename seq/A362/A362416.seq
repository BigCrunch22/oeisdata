%N A362416 Winning numbers of game where you can either add one or divide by a prime.
%C A362416 Two players take turns naming a positive integer. When one player says the number n, the other player can either reply with n+1 or with n/p for some prime p if n/p is an integer. We call these two types of moves a successor move and a division move, respectively. The player who says the number 1 wins. This sequence consists of the winning numbers, i.e., the player that says one of these numbers can force a win.
%C A362416 Note that a round of this game could be infinite if both players always make successor moves, but with reasonable play (both players trying to win), each round is finite: Assume that one player just said the number n. We argue that the sequence will reach a number strictly smaller than n after at most n steps. It suffices that within the next n steps, a division move is made at least once to immediately reach a number smaller than n. By Bertrand's Postulate, there is a prime p with n <= p < 2n. So within the first n steps of the game, either one player makes a division move, in which case the result is strictly smaller than n, or the players keep making successor moves until p is reached. But if p is reached, the only reasonable play is to make a division move and say "1", since this wins the game.
