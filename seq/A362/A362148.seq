%N A362148 Numbers that are neither cubefree nor cubefull.
%C A362148 In fact, every cubefull number > 1 is noncubefree, but the converse is false.
%C A362148 This sequence = A046099 \ A036966 and lists these counterexamples.
%C A362148 Numbers k such that for some primes p and q, k is divisible by p^3*q but not by q^3. - _Robert Israel_, Apr 28 2023
%C A362148 The asymptotic density of this sequence is 1 - 1/zeta(3) = 0.168092... - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Apr 28 2023
%C A362148 From _Amiram Eldar_, Sep 17 2023: (Start)
%C A362148 Numbers k such that A360539(k) > 1 and A360540(k) > 1.
%C A362148 Equivalently, numbers that have in their prime factorization at least one exponent that is smaller than 3 and at least one exponent that is larger than 2. (End)
%F A362148 Equals A362147 \ A004709.
%F A362148 Sum_{n>=1} 1/a(n) = 1 + zeta(s) - zeta(s)/zeta(3*s) - Product_{p prime}(1 + 1/(p^(2*s)*(p^s-1))), s > 1. - _Amiram Eldar_, Sep 17 2023
%e A362148 24 = 2^3 * 3 is noncubefree as it is divisible by the cube 2^3, but it is not cubefull because 3 divides 24 but 3^3 does not divide 24, hence 24 is a term.
%e A362148 648 = 2^4 * 3^3 is noncubefree as it is divisible by the cube 3^3, but it is also cubefull because primes 2 and 3 divide 648, and 2^3 and 3^3 divide also 648, so 648 is not a term.
