%N A362743 Positive integers which cannot be written as a sum of distinct numbers of the form 4^a + 5^b (a,b >= 0).
%C A362743 If a(7) exists, it will be greater than 2750.
%C A362743 Conjecture 1: The only terms of the current sequence are 1, 3, 4, 10, 12, 18. Moreover, any positive integer not among 1, 3, 4, 8, 10, 12, 13, 18, 25, 39, 42 can be written as a sum of numbers of the form 4^a + 5^b (a,b>=0) with no one summand dividing another.
%C A362743 Conjecture 2: Let k and m be positive integers greater than one with k*m even. Then, any sufficiently large integer n can be written as a sum of distinct numbers of the form k^a + m^b with a and b nonnegative integers.
%C A362743 Conjecture 3: Let k and m be positive integers greater than one with k*m even. Then, any sufficiently large integer n can be written as a sum of numbers of the form k^a + m^b (a,b >= 0) with no summand dividing another.
%C A362743 Clearly, Conjecture 3 is stronger than Conjecture 2.
%C A362743 See also A362861 for similar conjectures.

%e A362743 a(1) = 1 since 4^a + 5^b > 1 for all a,b >= 0.
%e A362743 a(2) = 3 since 2 = 4^0 + 5^0, and 3 cannot be written as a sum of distinct numbers of the form 4^a + 5^b with a,b >= 0.
