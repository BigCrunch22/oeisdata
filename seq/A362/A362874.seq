%N A362874 Number of strongly magic quad squares that can be formed using cards from Quads-2^n deck.
%C A362874 This sequence is related to the game of EvenQuads: a deck of 64 cards with 3 attributes and 4 values in each attribute. Four cards form a quad when for every attribute, the values are either the same, all different, or half-half.
%C A362874 This sequence counts the strongly magic quad squares that can be made using the Quads-2^n deck. Here a strongly magic quad square is defined to be a 4-by-4 square of Quads cards so that if row/column numbers (0 to 3) of four cards form a quad, the cards have to form a quad.
%C A362874 a(n) is the number of 4-by-4 squares that can be made out of distinct numbers in the range from 0 to 2^n-1, so that for any four cells that have their row numbers (0 to 3), as well as column numbers (0 to 3), bitwise XOR to 0, the values in these cells have to bitwise XOR to 0.
