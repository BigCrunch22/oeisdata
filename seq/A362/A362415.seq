%N A362415 The n-th run occurs a(n) times, where each run is chosen to be shortest, then lexicographically earliest.
%C A362415 When a run occurs 2 times, as run numbers r and s, it has both a(r)=2 and a(s)=2.
%C A362415 What are the densities of 1's and 2's?

%e A362415 The first few runs begin
%e A362415      n: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
%e A362415   a(n): 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2
%e A362415    Run: 1, 2, 3,    4,    5,       6
%e A362415 Run r=1 is {1} and its a(r) = a(1) = 1 says this {1} occurs 1 time, so never again.
%e A362415 Run r=2 is {2} and its a(r) = a(2) = 2 says this {2} occurs 2 times, so again later.
%e A362415 Run r=3 cannot be {1} since a(1)=1 does not allow a second occurrence of {1}, but it can be {1,1} and its a(r) = a(3) = 1 says this {1,1} occurs 1 time, so never again.
%e A362415 Run r=4 cannot be {2} because although permitted by its previous a(2)=2, here its a(r) = a(4) = 1 would say {2} occurs 1 time (which would be false), so instead run 4 must be {2,2}.
