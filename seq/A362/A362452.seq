%N A362452 Gilbreath transform of {sigma(i)-i, i >= 1} (see sum of aliquot parts, A001065).
%C A362452 See A362451 for further information.
%C A362452 The first 2000 terms of the present sequence suggest that the terms are usually 0's and 1's, except for an initial "geyser".
%C A362452 [It would be nice to have a larger b-file, and plots of large numbers of initial terms.]
