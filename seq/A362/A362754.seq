%N A362754 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 6; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not yet appeared that shares a factor with a(n-1) and also contains as a factor the smallest prime that is not a factor of a(n-1).
%C A362754 No term can be a prime power as each term must contain at least two distinct prime factors. This make the sequence similar to A360519 and A361606. A close examination of the lines of concentrated terms, see the attached images, shows they have a slight downward curvature. In the first 250000 terms the only fixed points are 1, 69, 87, 116825, although it is possible more exist for very large values of n.
