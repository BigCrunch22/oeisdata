%N A362801 Numbers whose set of divisors can be partitioned into disjoint parts, all of length > 1 and having integer harmonic mean.
%C A362801 Numbers k such that A362802(k) > 0.
%C A362801 Includes all the harmonic numbers (A001599) except for 1, since the set of their divisors has an integer harmonic mean (in this case the partition is into a single part).
%C A362801 This sequence is infinite. For example, if k is a term and p is a prime that does not divide k, then k*p is also a term.
%e A362801 12 is a term since its set of divisors, {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12} can be partitioned into 2 disjoint parts, {1, 2, 3, 6} and {4, 12}, whose harmonic means, 2 and 6, are both integers.
