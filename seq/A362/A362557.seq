%N A362557 Start with first term 0, then add paired terms counting every preceding term up to the largest term so far and loop back to 0 after every pair has been counted.
%C A362557 Same as A055186, except previous pairs from the same row are included in the count.
%e A362557 Write "0". There is now "1 0". Now there is "1 1". We can't find any terms greater than 1, so we recheck the sequence for 0s and find "2 0(s)". Listing these terms in the order read out loud yields the sequence "0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 0, ...".
