%N A362559 Number of integer partitions of n whose weighted sum is divisible by n.
%C A362559 The (one-based) weighted sum of a sequence (y_1,...,y_k) is Sum_{i=1..k} i*y_i. This is also the sum of partial sums of the reverse.
%C A362559 Also the number of n-multisets of positive integers that (1) have integer mean, (2) cover an initial interval, and (3) have weakly decreasing multiplicities.
%C A362559 Conjecture: A partition of n has weighted sum divisible by n iff its reverse has weighted sum divisible by n.
%e A362559 The weighted sum of y = (4,2,2,1) is 1*4+2*2+3*2+4*1 = 18, which is a multiple of 9, so y is counted under a(9).
%e A362559 The a(1) = 1 through a(9) = 5 partitions:

%Y A362559 For median instead of mean we have A362558.
%Y A362559 The complement is counted by A362560.
%Y A362559 A000041 counts integer partitions, strict A000009.
%Y A362559 A008284/A058398/A327482 count partitions by mean.
%Y A362559 A264034 counts partitions by weighted sum.
%Y A362559 A304818 = weighted sum of prime indices, row-sums of A359361.
%Y A362559 A318283 = weighted sum of reversed prime indices, row-sums of A358136.
