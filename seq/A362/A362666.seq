%N A362666 a(n) is the largest m such that iphi(m) = n, where iphi is the infinitary totient function A091732, or a(n) = 0 if no such m exists.

%F A362666 a(A362486(n)) = 0.
%e A362666 a(1) = 2 since there are two solutions to iphi(x) = 1: 1 and 2, and 2 is the larger of them.
%e A362666 a(6) = 24 since there are four solutions to iphi(x) = 6: 7, 12, 14 and 24, and 24 is the largest of them.
