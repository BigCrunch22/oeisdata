%N A346448 Number of nontrivial disconnected induced K_{1,3}-saturated graphs on n vertices.
%C A346448 A graph G is induced H-saturated if there exists no induced subgraph H in G, but for every edge e in the complement of G, the graph G+e has an induced subgraph H.  We consider the complete graph K_n to be the trivial case.  This is an empirical observation verified via a computer program.
%C A346448 Note that for n=11, the runtime is about 4 days.
