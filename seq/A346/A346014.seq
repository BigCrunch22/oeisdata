%N A346014 Numbers whose average number of distinct prime factors of their divisors is an integer.
%C A346014 First differs from A030229 at n = 275. a(275) = 900 is the least term that is not squarefree and therefore not in A030229.
%C A346014 The least term whose exponents in its prime factorization are not all the same is 1080 = 2^3 * 3^3 * 5.
%C A346014 The least term whose exponents in its prime factorization are distinct is 1440 = 2^5 * 3^2 * 5.
%C A346014 Numbers k such that A000005(k) | A062799(k).
%C A346014 Numbers k such that A346010(k) = 1.
%C A346014 Numbers k such that if the prime factorization of k is Product_{i} p_i^e_i, then Sum_{i} e_i/(e_i + 1) is an integer.
%C A346014 Includes all the squarefree numbers with an even number of prime divisors (A030229), i.e., the union of A006881, A046386, A067885, A123322, ...
%C A346014 If k is squarefree with m prime divisors then k^(m-1) is a term. E.g., the squares of the sphenic numbers (A162143) are terms.
