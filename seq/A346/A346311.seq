%N A346311 Maximum number of edges a single edge crosses in a drawing of the complete graph K_n where every vertex lies on the outer face.
%e A346311 K_1, K_2, K_3 are all outerplanar graphs, and therefore have no crossings. K_4 can be drawn as a box with one crossing inside the box. K_5 can be drawn as a pentagram inside a pentagon, and in a drawing of a pentagram any edge crosses only two other edges.
