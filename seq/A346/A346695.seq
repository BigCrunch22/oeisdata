%N A346695 Numbers with more divisors than digits in their binary representation.
%C A346695 Not all terms are perfect or abundant, with 105 being the first deficient term.
%C A346695 There are no primes in the sequence, and 6 is the only semiprime.
%C A346695 By the same comments as those at A175495, this sequence is infinite.
%C A346695 This sequence is a subsequence of A175495.
%C A346695 It is natural to conjecture that this sequence has asymptotic density 0. However, after the first three terms where a(n)/n = 6 -- a function which would increase to infinity if the asymptotic density were zero -- it drops, and it seems to take a long time to get that high again. The first time it gets above 5.0 is at a(30243)=151216. Even as high as a(2188516)=10000000, the density is only ~1/4.57.
%C A346695 The number of terms with m binary digits is Sum_{k>m} A346730(m,k). - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Jul 31 2021
%e A346695 12 has 6 divisors: {1,2,3,4,6,12}. 12 is written in binary as 1100, which has 4 digits. Since 6 > 4, 12 is in the sequence.
