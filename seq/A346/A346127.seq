%N A346127 Numbers m such that no self-avoiding walk that can make turns from the set +-Pi/7, +-3*Pi/7, +-5*Pi/7, of length m + 1 fits into the smallest circle that can enclose a walk of length m.
%C A346127 Although closed walks (see A316197) would be allowed, no closed walk that fits into a smaller enclosing circle than any open walk of the same length is known.
