%N A346693 Minimum integer length of a segment that touches the interior of n squares on a unit square grid.
%C A346693 This sequence, {a(n)}, is the "inverse" of A346232, {b(n)}, in the following sense: a(n) = min{L positive integer with b(L)>=n} and b(n) = max{S positive integer with a(S) <= n}.
%C A346693 The sequence is nondecreasing.
%C A346693 Except for the initial run of 3 equal values, it is formed by runs of 1 or 2 equal values, with an increment of 1 between consecutive runs.
%C A346693 There can be no more than 3 different consecutive terms.
%C A346693 A run of 2 equal values always has 2 different terms before and 2 different terms after the run, except for the initial terms (1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3).

%F A346693 a(n) = 1 for n <= 3; a(n) = ceiling(sqrt((n-3)^2/2+1)) for n >= 4.
%e A346693 A segment of length 1 can touch a maximum of 3 squares (segment close to a square vertex and oriented at 45 degrees; see image in A346232), therefore a(1) = a(2) = a(3) = 1.
%e A346693 A segment of length 2 can touch a maximum of 5 squares, therefore a(4) = a(5) = 2.
%e A346693 A segment of length 3 can touch a maximum of 7 squares, therefore a(6) = a(7) = 3.
