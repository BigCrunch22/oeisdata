%N A346128 Numbers m such that no self-avoiding walk that can make turns from the set 0, +-Pi/4, +-Pi/2, +-3*Pi/4, of length m + 1 fits into the smallest circle that can enclose a walk of length m.
%C A346128 Closed walks (see A316198) are allowed, but except for the closed square-shaped walk of length 4 that fits into the same smallest enclosing circle as the smallest open walk of this length, no other closed walk that fits into a smaller enclosing circle than any open walk of the same length is known.
