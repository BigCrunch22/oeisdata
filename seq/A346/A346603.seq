%N A346603 The first of four solutions to a Monthly problem asking if there exist finite sequences 1 < a(1) < a(2) < ... < a(n) such that Sum_i 1/a(i) = 1 and gcd(a(i), a(i+1)) = 1 for 1 <= i < n.
%C A346603 There are probably a large number of such sequences, but it seems worthwhile putting these four examples on record. They were the only solutions submitted.
