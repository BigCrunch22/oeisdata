%N A346126 Numbers m such that no self-avoiding walk of length m + 1 on the hexagonal lattice fits into the smallest circle that can enclose a walk of length m.
%C A346126 Open and closed walks are allowed. It is conjectured that all optimal paths are closed except for the trivial path of length 1. See the related conjecture in A122226.
