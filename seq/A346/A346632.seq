%N A346632 Triangle read by rows giving the main diagonals of the matrices counting integer compositions by length and alternating sum (A345197).
%C A346632 The matrices (A345197) count the integer compositions of n of length k with alternating sum i, where 1 <= k <= n, and i ranges from -n + 2 to n in steps of 2. The alternating sum of a sequence (y_1,...,y_k) is Sum_i (-1)^(i-1) y_i.
