%N A346529 a(n) is the number of primes that are nearest neighbors of the n-th Ramanujan's highly composite number A002182.
%C A346529 Terms are only 0, 1 or 2.
%F A346529 a(n) = A010051(A002182(n)-1) + A010051(A002182(n)+1). - _Michel Marcus_, Aug 17 2021
%e A346529 For n = 8 the 8th highly composite numbers is 48, thus its nearest neighbors are 47 and 49, only 47 is prime so a(8) = 1.
%e A346529 For n = 9 the 9th highly composite numbers is 60, thus its nearest neighbors are 59 and 61, both are twin primes so a(9) = 2.
%e A346529 For n = 10 the 10th highly composite numbers is 120, thus its nearest neighbors are 119 and 121, both are nonprimes so a(10) = 0.
