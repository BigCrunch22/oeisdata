%N A346777 a(n) is the number of consecutive even prime gaps (g1, g2) satisfying g1 == 2 (mod 6) and g2 == 4 (mod 6) out of the first 2^n consecutive even prime gaps.
%C A346777 The prime gaps are given in A001223. Here we consider the gaps satisfying the conditions A001223(k) == 2 and A001223(k+1) == 4 (mod 6) for 1 < k <= 2^n + 1.
%F A346777 a(n) = A341531(n) - A346776(n) - 1.
%e A346777 The sequence A001223(n) mod 6 is given by:
%e A346777 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 0, 2, 0, 4, 2, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4, 2, 0, 4, 0, 2, ..., denoted here as b(0), b(1), b(2), ..., i.e. b(n) = A001223(n+1) (mod 6) for n >= 0.
%e A346777 The term b(0) is excluded by definition. The conditions b(k) = 2 and b(k+1) == 4 are obtained for k = 2, 4, 6, 12 ...
%e A346777 So a(0) = 0 (k = 2^0 does not occur), a(1) = 1 (one value of k satisfying k <= 2^1), a(2) = 2 (two value of k satisfying k <= 2^2) and a(3) = 3 (three value of k satisfying k <= 2^3).
