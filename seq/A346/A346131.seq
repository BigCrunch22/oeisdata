%N A346131 Numbers m such that no self-avoiding walk that can make turns from the set +-Pi/11, +-3*Pi/11, +-5*Pi/11, +-7*Pi/11, +-9*Pi/11, of length m + 1 fits into the smallest circle that can enclose a walk of length m.
%C A346131 Although closed walks (see A316201) would be allowed, no closed walk that fits into a smaller enclosing circle than any open walk of the same length is known.
