%N A346926 a(n) is the smallest positive integer whose square starts and ends with exactly n identical digits, and a(n) = 0 when there is no such integer.
%C A346926 When a square ends in exactly three identical digits, these digits are necessarily 444 (A039685).
%C A346926 When a square ends with n > 3 identical digits, these last digits are necessarily 0's, and also this is only possible when n is even.
%C A346926 Differs from A174499 where only at least n identical digits are required.
%F A346926 a(2*n+1) = 0 for n >= 2.
%F A346926 a(2*n) = A119511(2*n) * 10^n, for n >= 2.
%e A346926 a(2) = 88 because 88^2 = 7744 starts with two 7's and ends with two 4's, and 88 is the smallest integer whose square starts and ends with exactly 2 identical digits.
%e A346926 a(4) = 235700 because 235700^2 = 55554490000 starts with four 5's and ends with four 0's, and 235700 is the smallest integer whose square starts and ends with exactly 4 identical digits.
%Y A346926 Cf. A039685, A119511, A174499, A346774, A346892.
