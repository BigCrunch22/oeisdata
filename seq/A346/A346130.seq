%N A346130 Numbers m such that no self-avoiding walk that can make turns from the set 0, +-Pi/5, +-2*Pi/5, +-3*Pi/5, +-4*Pi/5, of length m + 1 fits into the smallest circle that can enclose a walk of length m.
%C A346130 Closed walks (see A316200) are allowed. The only known closed walk that fits into a smaller enclosing circle than any open walk of the same length occurs for length 8.
