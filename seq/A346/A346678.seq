%N A346678 Positive numbers whose squares end in exactly two identical digits.
%C A346678 When a square ends in exactly two identical digits, these digits are necessarily 00 or 44, so all terms are even.
%C A346678 The numbers are of the form: 10*floor((10*k-1)/9), k > 0, or, 50*floor((10*k-1)/9) +- 38, k > 0.
%C A346678 Equivalently: m is in the sequence iff either (m == 0 (mod 10) and m <> 0 (mod 100)) or (m == +- 38 (mod 50) and m <> +- 38 (mod 500)).

%F A346678 a(n+63) = a(n) + 500.
%e A346678 12 is in the sequence because 12^2 = 144 ends in two 4's.
%e A346678 20 is in the sequence because 20^2 = 400 ends in two 0's.
%e A346678 38 is not in the sequence because 38^2 = 1444 ends in three 4's.
