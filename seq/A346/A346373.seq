%N A346373 Lowest edge indices of an edge-connected n-gon chain (beginning with n = 3, and increasing by one for each subsequent n-gon), such that no n-gons in the sequence overlap.
%C A346373 Joining regular polygons (n-gons) of unit side length, such that each n-gon shares one edge with the previous n-gon, starting with a triangle (3-gon), and increasing n by 1 for each subsequent n-gon, this sequence is a list of indices, a(n), that correspond to the edges of each n-gon in sequence, such that, for each n-gon, a(n) is the smallest possible edge index so as not to allow any n-gon to overlap with any other n-gon. The edge indices for an n-gon are defined as a_n(n) = 1 for the edge that is joined with an edge of a previous n-gon, and increase by 1 for each subsequent edge in a clockwise fashion (or, counterclockwise; the sequence remains identical), up to a_n(n) = n. Then, a(n) = min(a_n(n)), such that the above holds.
%C A346373 It appears a(n) approaches n/2, for large n.
