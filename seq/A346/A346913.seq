%N A346913 Irregular triangle read by rows where each row is the level sequence of a rooted tree in Beyer and Hedetniemi's iteration.
%C A346913 Beyer and Hedetniemi represent a rooted tree by the sequence of levels (depths) of each vertex in a pre-order traversal of the tree, and they take as a canonical form the lexicographically greatest level sequence among possible orderings of siblings in the tree.
%C A346913 The root of each tree is at level 1, its children are at level 2, and so on.
%C A346913 The number of rooted trees of <= N vertices is A087803(N) so rows n = 1 .. A087803(N) inclusive are the trees of <= N vertices.
%C A346913 Beyer and Hedetniemi's successor function, for transforming a given levels sequence (of N vertices) to the next, is:
%C A346913 - find the end-most vertex p with levels[p] >= 3
%C A346913 - find vertex q which is the parent of p, being the end-most q < p with levels[q] = levels[p] - 1
%C A346913 - change terms levels[p..N] to copies of levels[q..p-1], including a final partial copy if necessary
%C A346913 If no p has levels[p] >= 3 then this is the last tree of N vertices (star 1,2,2,...,2,2) and the next tree is the first of N+1 vertices which is 1,2,3,...,N+1 (path down).
%C A346913 Rows of a given N vertices are in lexicographically decreasing order.  The successor function finds the end-most levels entry able to decrease, decreases it, and fills the rest with the greatest values permitted by the canonical form and thus the lexicographically smallest overall decrease.
%C A346913 Beyer and Hedetniemi show the successor function takes constant amortized time, meaning that the number of vertices examined and changed per tree, averaged over all trees of N vertices, has a constant upper bound.

%e A346913 Beyer and Hedetniemi give the following example of the successor function (except a misprint omits one end-most 2), which here is row n=7726:

%e A346913                    ^^^^^ ^^^^^ ^^^   block copies
%e A346913 Vertices p..end are not a multiple of q..p-1 block length 3, so a final partial block copy.
