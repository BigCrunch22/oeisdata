%N A346399 a(n) is the number of symmetrically distributed consecutive primes centered at n (including n itself if n is prime).
%C A346399 a(n) is the number of consecutive primes in Goldbach pairs of 2n centered at n.
%C A346399 a(n) is odd if n is prime; otherwise, a(n) is even.
%C A346399 n is prime if a(n) = 1 and n is composite if a(n) = 0.

%e A346399 a(1) = 0 because no prime is <= 1.
%e A346399 a(2) = 1 because no prime is < 2 and {2} is the only symmetrically distributed prime centered at 2.
%e A346399 a(30) = 10 because there are 10 symmetrically distributed consecutive primes, {13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47}, centered at 30.
