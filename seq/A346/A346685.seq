%N A346685 a(n) is the smallest positive integer k such that for all x >= k, at least 50% of the integers in the range 1..x contain n in their decimal expansion. In other words, it is the largest integer k such that exactly half of the integers 1..k have n in their decimal expansion.
%C A346685 The sequence is inspired by the fact that, for any string of decimal digits, s, "almost all" integers contain s in their decimal expansion. (The same is true for other bases.)
%e A346685 a(1) = 1062880 because exactly half of the integers in [1..1062880] have a 1 in their decimal expansion.
%Y A346685 Cf. A343839, A344636, A344474.
%Y A346685 Also, this sequence has several values that coincide with values in A117862.
