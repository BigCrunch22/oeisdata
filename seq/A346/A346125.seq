%N A346125 Numbers m such that no self-avoiding walk that can make turns from the set +-Pi/5, +-3*Pi/5, of length m + 1 fits into the smallest circle that can enclose a walk of length m.
%C A346125 Although closed walks (see A316195) would be allowed, no closed walk that fits into a smaller enclosing circle than any open walk of the same length is known.
