%N A346150 Alternating runs of primes and composites, with the runs of primes being of composite length and the runs of composites being of prime length.
%C A346150 In other words, use sequence A073846 to list alternating runs of primes and composites, with the number of elements in each run given by successive terms in A073846 - with each even-indexed term of A073846 (being itself prime) denoting the length of each run of composites and each odd-indexed term of A073846 (being itself composite) denoting the length of each run of primes.
%e A346150 a(1) = 2, this being a length 1 (1 is initial index) run of primes.
%e A346150 a(2) = 4 & a(3) = 6, 4 and 6 being a length 2 (2 is first prime) run of composites.
%e A346150 a(4) = 3, a(5) = 5, a(6) = 7, and a(7) = 11 being a length 4 (4 is first composite) run of primes.
%e A346150 a(8) = 8, a(9) = 9, and a(10) = 10, being a length 3 (3 is 2nd prime) run of composites.
