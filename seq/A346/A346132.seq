%N A346132 Numbers m such that no self-avoiding walk that can make turns from the set 0, +-Pi/6, +-2*Pi/6, +-3*Pi/6, +-4*Pi/6, +-5*Pi/6, of length m + 1 fits into the smallest circle that can enclose a walk of length m.
%C A346132 Closed walks are allowed (see A316192). The only known closed walks that fit into a smaller enclosing circle than any open walk of the same length occur for lengths 3 and 5.
