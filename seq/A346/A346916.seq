%N A346916 Decimal expansion of the limit as N->oo of the mean number of singletons per forest in the rooted forests of N vertices.
%C A346916 There are A000081(N+1) rooted forests of N vertices and A087803(N) singletons in those forests, so the present constant is S = lim_{N->oo} A087803(N) / A000081(N+1).
%C A346916 The respective asymptotic formulas for A000081 and A087803 show that S = 1/(d-1) where d=A051491 is the growth power of rooted trees and forests.
