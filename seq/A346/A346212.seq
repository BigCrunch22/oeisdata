%N A346212 Numbers m such that abs(K(m+1) - K(m)) = 2, and both m and m+1 are squarefree (A005117), where K(m) = A002034(m) is the Kempner function.
%C A346212 Earls (2005) noted that if m > 2 is a solution to abs(K(m+1) - K(m)) = 1 (A346211) then either m or m+1 is nonsquarefree (A013929), and asked whether there are any solutions with both m and m+1 being squarefree.
%C A346212 There are no such solutions below 10^9.
%C A346212 Since there are also no solutions to K(m) = K(m+1) below 10^9, it can be conjectured that the minimal difference abs(K(m+1) - K(m)) between consecutive numbers m and m+1 that are both squarefree is 2.
%C A346212 a(1)-a(40) were calculated by Earls (2005).
