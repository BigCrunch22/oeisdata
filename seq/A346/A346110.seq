%N A346110 Numbers whose square can be represented in exactly four ways as the sum of a positive square and a positive fourth power.
%C A346110 Terms are numbers z such that there are exactly four solutions to z^2 = x^2 + y^4, where x, y and z belong to the set of positive integers.
%C A346110 Terms cannot be a square (see the comment from Altug Alkan in A111925).
%C A346110 Terms must have at least one prime factor of the form p == 1 (mod 4), a Pythagorean prime (A002144).
%C A346110 If the terms additionally have prime factors of the form p == 3 (mod 4), which are in A002145, then they must appear in the prime divisor sets of x and y too.
%C A346110 The special prime factor 2 has the same behavior. Means: If the term is even, x and y must be even too.
%C A346110 Apparently, all terms are divisible by 65. The divided terms are in A346594. Are there exceptions for n > 25? - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Jul 14 2021, Jul 29 2021
%C A346110 Yes, there are exceptions: a(44,46,53,95,97) are not divisible by 65 (5*13) but they have in common: They are divisible by 145 (5*29). - _Karl-Heinz Hofmann_, Aug 28 2021

%e A346110 29679^2 = 29640^2 + 39^4, so 29679 is not a term (only one solution).
%e A346110 60^2 + 5^4 = 63^2 + 4^4 = 65^2, so 65 is not a term (only two solutions).
%e A346110 572^2 + 39^4 = 1500^2 + 25^4 = 1575^2 + 20^4 = 1625^2, so 1625 is not a term (only three solutions).
%e A346110 165308^2 + 663^4 = 349575^2 + 560^4 = 433500^2 + 425^4 = 455175^2 + 340^4 = 469625^2, so 469625 is a term (four solutions).
