%N A346523 Number of sum pyramids for n.
%C A346523 A sum pyramid for n is defined to be a pyramid with n at its apex, all pairs of adjacent members (x, y) of rows 2,3,4,... sum to the element immediately above, every element is positive and distinct, rows are complete (length of row m = length of row (m-1) + 1), reflections are not counted, and the pyramid is maximal (i.e., not part of a larger pyramid that qualifies). An example of the meaning of "maximal" can be seen in the Example section: the pyramids
