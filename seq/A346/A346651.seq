%N A346651 a(n) is the number of divisors of A139245(n) ending with 2.
%C A346651 a(n) is odd if and only if A139245(n) either is the square of a number ending with 2 or has a unitary prime divisor ending with 7.
%C A346651 The term 1 appears only for n = 1 in corresponding to A139245(1) = 4.
%e A346651 a(14) = 4 since there are 4 divisors of A139245(14) = 264 ending with 2: 2, 12, 22 and 132.
