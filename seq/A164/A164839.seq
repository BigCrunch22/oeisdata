%N A164839 Left-truncatable squares: every suffix is square.
%C A164839 This sequence is finite and 81 is the last term. If another term were to exist it must contain 3 digits and contract to 49, 64, or 81. No such 3 digit square exists. [From _Sean A. Irvine_, Sep 08 2009]
%e A164839 a(5) = 64 since 64 is a perfect square and 4 is also a perfect square.
