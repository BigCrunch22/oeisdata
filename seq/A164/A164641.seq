%N A164641 Numbers n such that n, n + 2 and n + 6 are prime powers.
%C A164641 Numbers n such that n + (0, 2, 6) is a prime power triple.
%C A164641 Prime power triples with pattern n + (0, 2, 6), a generalization of the prime triples with pattern n + (0, 2, 6). The prime triples with pattern n + (0, 2, 6) are a subsequence.
%C A164641 n + (0, 2, 6), being an admissible pattern for prime triples, since (0, 2, 6) = (0, 0, 0) (mod 2) = (0, 2, 0) (mod 3), has high density.
%C A164641 n + (0, 4, 6), being an admissible pattern for prime triples, since (0, 4, 6) = (0, 0, 0) (mod 2) = (0, 1, 0) (mod 3), has high density.
%C A164641 n + (0, 2, 4), being a non-admissible pattern for prime triples, since (0, 2, 4) = (0, 0, 0) (mod 2) = (0, 2, 1) (mod 3), has low density.
