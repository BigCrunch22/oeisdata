%N A164883 Cubes with the property that the sum of the cubes of the digits is also a cube.
%C A164883 It is known (Murthy 2001) that the sequence is infinite. (1) The number {3(10^(k+2)+1)}^3 for all k produces such numbers. (2) Less trivially, {10^(n+2) - 4}^3 is a member of this sequence for n = 4*{(10^(3k)-1)/27}-1, for all k, for which the sum of the cubes of the digits is {6*10^k}^3.
