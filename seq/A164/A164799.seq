%N A164799 a(n) = the smallest positive integer such that the product of a(n) consecutive integers, where n is the smallest, is divisible by every prime from 2 to the largest prime divisor of the product. (a(1)=1.)
%C A164799 a(n) = A164798(n) - n +1.
%e A164799 Consider the products of consecutive integers, (m+9)!/9!, m >= 1. First, 10 is divisible by 2 and 5, but there is a prime gap since 3 is missing from the factorization. 10*11 is divisible by 2, 5, and 11, but 3 and 7 are missing. 10*11*12 is divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 11, but 7 is missing. 10*11*12*13 is divisible by all primes up to 13, except 7. But 10*11*12*13*14 is indeed divisible by every prime from 2 to 13. So a(10) = 5 because 5 consecutive numbers are multiplied together.
