%N A164714 A positive integer n is included if all runs of 0's in binary n are of the same length, and if all runs of 1's in binary n are of the same length, and if there are at least two runs of 0's and at least two runs of 1's.
%C A164714 Clarification: A binary number consists of "runs" completely of 1's alternating with runs completely of 0's. No two or more runs all of the same digit are adjacent.
%C A164714 The length of each run of 1's may be different that the length of each run of 0's.
%C A164714 This sequence contains those positive integers in both sequence A164709 and sequence A164712.
%C A164714 The integers of this sequence, along with those positive integers that have (when written in binary) only one run of 0's and/or only one run of 1's, make up sequence A164713.
