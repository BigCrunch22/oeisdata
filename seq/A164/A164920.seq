%N A164920 Primes which are obtained at least by two ways using the iterations of the Bertrand operator (see A164917) beginning with primes of A164368.
%C A164920 The sequence is connected with our sieve selecting the primes of A164368 from all primes.

%e A164920 113 is in the sequence since it is obtained either by iterations of Bertrand operator beginning from 17 (17=>31=>61=>113) or by such iterations beginning with 59 (59=>113), and both of primes 17 and 59 are in A164368.
