%N A164980 Number of primes between consecutive terms of A164901.
%C A164980 Conjecture: Each term is 0 or 1. I have confirmed this for the first 3499 terms while calculating this b-file based on A164901's b-file.
%C A164980 2481 and 1018 are the numbers of 0's and 1's, respectively, and 2481/3499 = 0.7090597... is the maximum density of 0's beyond a(1) up to here.
%C A164980 Maximum known run lengths (through a(3486)): 22 0's beginning at a(1182), 8 1's beginning at a(2).
%C A164980 Again through a(3486), there are 204, 157, 113, 69, 57, 37, 28, 11, 12, 12, 5, 5, 7, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 runs of 0's of length 1, 2, ..., 22, and 524, 143, 36, 11, 6, 3, 0, 1 runs of 1's of length 1, 2, ..., 8.
