%N A164364 a(n) = A164349(2^n).
%C A164364 This is the last symbol at each stage of the method for generating A164349 using string operations.
%C A164364 The number of 1's in the string is given by A164363, and this number is given by the recurrence
%C A164364 A164363(n+1) = 2 * A164363(n) - A164364(n).
%C A164364 This leads to the formula A164363(n+1) = 2^n - 2^(n-1) * A164364(1) - 2^(n-2) * A164364(2) - ... - A164364(n);
%C A164364 for example,
%C A164364 A164363(5) = 16 - 8 A164364(1) - 4 A164364(2) - 2 A164364(3) - A164364(4).
%C A164364 This means that since the total number of symbols in the n-th string is 2**n + 1, the proportion of 0's in the first k terms of A164349, as n tends to infinity, is given by the number whose binary expansion is exactly this sequence. This number is approximately 0.6450588..
