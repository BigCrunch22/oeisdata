%N A164297 Let S(n) be the set of all positive integers that are <= n and are coprime to n. a(n) = the number of members of S(n) that are each non-coprime with at least one other member of S(n).

%e A164297 The positive integers that are <= 9 and are coprime to 9 are: 1,2,4,5, 7,8. 1 is coprime to each other member in S(9). While 2, 4, and 8 are non-coprime to each other. 5 is coprime to each other member of S(9). And 7 is also coprime to each other member. Since there are 3 integers in S(9) that are each non-coprime with at least one other member of S(9) -- these integers being 2, 4, and 8 -- then a(9) = 3.
