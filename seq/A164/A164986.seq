%N A164986 Numbers of the form 2p^2 = q^2 + 1, where p and q are primes.
%C A164986 A079704 INTERSECT A002522. Subsequence of A088920 (Solutions k to the Diophantine equation k = 2n^2 = m^2+1): those terms for which associated m in A002315 and n in A001653 are both prime.
%C A164986 Corresponding p are prime Pell numbers (prime denominators of continued fraction convergents to sqrt(2)).
%C A164986 Corresponding q are prime numerators of the continued fraction convergents to sqrt(2).
%C A164986 Corresponding p, q, p^2, q^2, (p,q), (q,p), etc., form subsequences of many other OEIS sequences; see cross-references.
%C A164986 Any further terms are too large to include here.
%F A164986 a(n) = 2*(A118612(n+1))^2 = (A086397(n+1))^2 + 1.
%e A164986 a(1) = 50 as 50 = 2*5^2 = 7^2 + 1, where 5 and 7 are prime.
