%N A164296 Let S(n) be the set of all positive integers that are <= n and are coprime to n. a(n) = the number of members of S(n) that are each coprime to every other member of S(n).
%C A164296 A164296(n) + A164297(n) = phi(n) (= A000010(n) = the number of elements in S(n)).

%e A164296 The positive integers that are <= 9 and are coprime to 9 are: 1,2,4,5, 7,8. 1 is coprime to each other member in S(9). While 2, 4, and 8 are non-coprime to each other. 5 is coprime to each other member of S(9). And 7 is also coprime to each other member. Since there are 3 integers in S(9) that are coprime to each other member -- these integers being 1, 5, and 7 -- then a(9) = 3.
