%N A164901 a(1)=1, a(2) = 2. For n >=3, a(n) = the smallest integer > a(n-1) that is coprime to every sum of any two distinct earlier terms of this sequence.
%C A164901 Except for 1 & 4, all the rest of the terms are prime. They have a density of about 4/5 of the primes for the first 2500 terms. Primes not a member of this sequence: 3, 5, 11, 17, 23, 31, 41, 47, 61, 71, 83, 101, 107, 113, 131, 139, 151, 167, 181, 193, 199, ..., . - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Aug 31 2009
%C A164901 Conjecture: No two consecutive primes are absent from this sequence (other than 3 and 5). (Equivalently, if p < q < r are consecutive primes and q > 5 is not a term, then p and r are terms.) See A164980. - _Rick L. Shepherd_, Sep 03 2009

%e A164901 The first 4 terms are 1,2,4,7. The sums of every pair of distinct terms are: 1+2=3, 1+4=5, 2+4=6, 7+1=8, 7+2=9, and 7+4=11. So we are looking for the smallest integer > 7 that is coprime to 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 11. This number, which is a(5), is 13.
