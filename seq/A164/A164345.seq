%N A164345 Powers of primes where the exponents are not powers of primes.
%C A164345 First differs from A164337, after the initial 1 in this sequence: 2^64 = 18446744073709551616 is in sequence A164337, but is not in this sequence.
%C A164345 This sequence contains those powers of primes that are not in sequence A096165.

%F A164345 Sum_{n>=1} 1/a(n) = 1 + Sum_{k in A024619} P(k) = 1.018407114609068368636..., where P is the prime zeta function. - _Amiram Eldar_, Nov 26 2020
%e A164345 2^12 = 4096. Since 2 is prime, and since 12 is not a power of a prime, then 4096 is in this sequence.
