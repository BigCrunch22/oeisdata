%N A164830 a(1) = 2; a(n) for n > 1 is the smallest k > a(n-1) such that the arithmetic mean of the divisors of k is one of the previous terms a(1), ..., a(n-1).
%C A164830 The arithmetic mean of the divisors of k is A000203(k)/A000005(k). a(n) for n > 1 is an arithmetic number, a term of A003601.
%C A164830 Similar sequences are obtained for other values of a(1). E.g. a(1) = 4 gives 4, 7, 13, 20, 45, 57, 89, 113, ... ; a(1) = 9 gives 9, 17, 22, 30, 43, 59, 87, 95, ... .
%e A164830 The smallest number with arithmetic mean of divisors = 2 is 3, hence a(2) = 3.
%e A164830 The next number with arithmetic mean of divisors in {2, 3} is 5, hence a(3) = 5.
%e A164830 The smallest number > a(5) = 11 with arithmetic mean of divisors in {a(1), ..., a(5)} = {2, 3, 5, 6, 11} is 14, hence a(6) = 14.
