%N A164946 The value A104017(n) rescaled with its decremented prime factors as described in A162290.
%C A164946 The entry N = A104017(n) is written as the product N = p*q*r*... of its k distinct prime factors p < q < r < ... . The (k-2)nd power multiplied by the decremented p-1 of the smallest prime factor and divided by the product of the decremented other prime factors defines a(n):  a(n) = (N-1)^(k-2)*(p-1)/( (q-1)*(r-1)*...). - _R. J. Mathar_, Dec 16 2010
%e A164946 The 4 factors of the first member of A104017 (11305) are 5, 7, 17 and 19. Hence the first term of the present sequence is (4*11304^2)/(6*16*18) = 295788.
