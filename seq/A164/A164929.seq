%N A164929 Sum of odd prime divisors of numbers with all odd prime divisors of the form 6k+1.
%C A164929 We define a sequence b(n) = 7, 13, 14, 19, 26, 28, 31, 37, 38, 43, 49, 52, ... to consist of those numbers where all odd prime factors are primes contained in A002476, and which have at least one prime factor in this class; b(n) is basically elements of A004611 multiplied by powers of 2.
%C A164929 a(n) is the sum of the distinct odd prime factors of b(n), where "distinct" means that the multiplicity (exponent) in the prime factorization of b(n) is ignored.
%C A164929 Analogous sequence for primes of form 4k+1 is A164927.
%C A164929 Analogous sequence for primes of form 4k+3 is A164928.
%C A164929 Analogous sequence for primes of form 6k+5 is A164930.
%C A164929 The sum of an even number of primes of form 6n+1 is even (hence composite).
%C A164929 The sum of 3 primes of form 6k+1 is composite because (6a+1)+(6b+1)+(6c+1) = 3*(a+b+c+1). However (see 2nd example) the sum of 5 primes of form 6k+1 may be prime.
%e A164929 a(22) = 20 because b(22) = 91 = 7*13, and 7+13 = 20.
%e A164929 The smallest number, all of whose prime factors are of form 6k+1, whose sum of distinct prime factors is prime: 1983163 = 7 * 13 * 19 * 31 * 37, and 7 + 13 + 19 + 31 + 37 = 107 is prime.
