%N A164339 Write down the primes dividing n (with repetition) in an exponent tower (see comment). a(n) = the smallest possible value of such a tower.
%C A164339 Clarification of definition: If p^j = the largest power of the prime p to divide n, then write down the prime p a total of j times. Do this for all primes dividing n. Next, take a permutation q = (q(1), q(2),...q(r)) (r = sum of the exponents in the prime-factorization of n) of all these primes, and write them in a exponent tower like this: q(1)^(q(2)^(q(3)^(...^q(r)))). a(n) = the smallest possible value of this tower, considering all permutations q.
%C A164339 a(32) = 2^2^2^2^2 is 19729 digits and too long to display.

%e A164339 The prime factorization of 12 is 2*2*3. The exponent tower permutations of these non-distinct prime factors are: 2^(2^3) = 256, 2^(3^2) = 512, and 3^(2^2) = 81. a(12) = the smallest of these, which is 81.
