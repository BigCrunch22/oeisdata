%N A164888 Smallest positive integer for each n such that the sequences a(n), a(n)+n, and a(n)+2n have no repeated terms.
%C A164888 If the a(n)+2n is left out, this definition gives us the lower Wythoff sequence, A000201.
%C A164888 It appears that the three sequences include every positive integer except 5.
%C A164888 It appears that the sequence is asymptotic to c*n, where c = 2.2143... is the positive root of x^3-4x-2. It appears that a(n) = c*n + O(log(n)); possibly even a(n) = c*n + O(1). (This polynomial is obtained by solving 1/x+1/(x+1)+1/(x+2) = 1.)
%e A164888 The first term is 1; the sequences start 1; 2; 3. The smallest possible value for a(2) is then 4, giving 1,4; 2,6; and 3,8. a(3) cannot be 5, because a(3)+3 = 8 in the second sequence would then duplicate the 8 in the third sequence. a(3) = 7 works; the sequences to that point are 1,4,7; 2,6,10; 3,8,13.
