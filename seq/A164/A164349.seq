%N A164349 The limit of the string "0, 1" under the operation 'repeat string twice and remove last symbol'.
%C A164349 We start with the string 01, at each step we replace the string by two concatenated copies and remove the last symbol.
%C A164349 01 -> 010 -> 01001 -> 010010100 etc.
%C A164349 Each string consists of 2^n + 1 symbols and clearly after this step the first 2^n + 1 symbols do not change.
%C A164349 Equivalently this sequence is given as follows: a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1, and for n>1, a(n) = first one of g(n), g(g(n)), g(g(g(n))).. etc. to be either 0 or 1, where g(n) = A053645(n-1).
%C A164349 The proportion of 0's in this sequence converges to a number close to 0.645059. The exact nature of this constant is not known. It is easy to show there are no 2 consecutive 1's.
%C A164349 Start of the first occurrence of k consecutive zeros: 0, 2, 7, 2046, > 8388600, ..., . - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Aug 17 2009
%C A164349 Start of the first occurrence of 5 consecutive zeros is > 2^34 - 5. Sum of the first 10^n terms b(n) begins: 0, 3, 36, 355, 3549, 35494, 354942, 3549412, 35494122, 354941215, 3549412151. - _Alex Ratushnyak_, Aug 15 2012
