%N A164361 The number of elements in S_5\det^{-1}(n)/GL(5,\Z), where we take det : M_{5 \x 5}(\Z) \rightarrow \Z.
%C A164361 Consider the set of 5 x 5 matrices with integer entries of a fixed determinant n. The group GL(5, \Z) acts on the right by multiplication. Similarly, the symmetric group S_5 acts on the left via multiplication by permutation matrices. The entry a_n is the number of elements in the double orbit space S_5\det^{-1}(n)/GL(5,\Z). The sequence a_n also gives the number of isomorphism classes of simplicial cones in \Z^5 of a certain index, or alternatively the number of affine toric varieties in dimension 5 arising from simplicial cones.
%e A164361 For n = 2, four representatives are [5,5]((1,0,0,0,0),(0,1,0,0,0),(0,0,1,0,0),(0,0,0,1,0),(0,0,0,1,2)), [5,5]((1,0,0,0,0),(0,1,0,0,0),(0,0,1,0,0),(0,0,0,1,0),(0,0,1,1,2)), [5,5]((1,0,0,0,0),(0,1,0,0,0),(0,0,1,0,0),(0,0,0,1,0),(0,1,1,1,2)), and [5,5]((1,0,0,0,0),(0,1,0,0,0),(0,0,1,0,0),(0,0,0,1,0),(1,1,1,1,2)).
%Y A164361 A162158 and A162159 are the relative sequences in dimensions 3 and 4 respectively.
