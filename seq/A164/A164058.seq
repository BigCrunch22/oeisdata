%N A164058 Number of curves in n-th letter of capitalized English alphabet (A being first).
%C A164058 "Curve" as was excluded from sums in A163828. Curves are classified as: circle as occurs in {O, Q}, semicircle as in {B (twice), C, D, G, J, P, R, U}, and other {S}. We do not consider "S" as two semicircles, nor make various approximations of curves as sequences of line segments (as in A002963). In conjunction with A163828, we may sum the number of curves and straight line segments in an English magiscule (capital) letter, and thus derive an integer total of the number of straight and curved segments in the spelled-out English name of any nonnegative integer.
%e A164058 a(2) = 2 because of the two semicircles in the 2nd letter, B. a(k) = 0 for k = {the letters occurring in A163670} = {A, E, F, H, I, K, L, M, N, T, V, W, X, Y, Z}.
%Y A164058 Cf. A002963, A005589, A163670, A163828.
