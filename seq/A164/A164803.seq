%N A164803 Arises in enumerating geometric hyperplanes of the near hexagon L_3 x GQ(2,2).
%C A164803 Leftmost and rightmost column of Table 2, p. 6, of Saniga et al.: An overview of the types of geometric hyperplanes of the near hexagon L_3 x GQ(2,2). For each type (Tp) of hyperplane we give the number of points (Pt) and lines (Ln), followed by the cardinalities of the points of a given order, cardinalities of deep (dp), singular (sg), ovoidal (ov) and subquadrangular (sq) quads of both kinds, and, finally, the total number of its copies (Cd). |H_i| = 1 (mod 4) for any i according to their point cardinality.
