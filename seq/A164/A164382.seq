%N A164382 Take sequence A114129, those integers that are factored into prime powers each with a distinct prime exponent. If the largest power of p dividing A114129(n) is p^q(p), p and q being primes, then a(n) = product{p|A114129(n)} q(p)^p.
%C A164382 This is a permutation of the terms of A114129.
%e A164382 288 is factored as 2^5 * 3^2. (Since the exponents 5 and 2 are distinct primes, then 288 is in sequence A114129.) The term of this sequence that corresponds to A114129(16) = 288 is then: a(16) = 5^2 * 2^3 = 200. Notably, 200 occurs in sequence A114129, as do all other terms of this sequence.
