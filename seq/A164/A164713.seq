%N A164713 A positive integer n is included if all runs of 0's in binary n are of the same length, and if all runs of 1's in binary n are of the same length.
%C A164713 Clarification: A binary number consists of "runs" completely of 1's alternating with runs completely of 0's. No two or more runs all of the same digit are adjacent.
%C A164713 The length of each run of 1's may be different that the length of each run of 0's.
%C A164713 This sequence contains those positive integers in both sequence A164707 and sequence A164710.
%C A164713 For those integers in this sequence that each have at least two runs of 0's and at least two runs of 1's, see sequence A164714.
