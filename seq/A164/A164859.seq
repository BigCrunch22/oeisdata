%N A164859 a(1)=1. a(n) = the smallest positive integer that, when written in binary, contains both binary a(n-1) and binary n as (possibly overlapping) substrings.
%e A164859 a(6) = 44, which is 101100 in binary. a(7) therefore contains both 101100 and the binary representation of 7, which is 111, as substrings when a(7) is written in binary. So a(7) = 236, which is 11101100 in binary. (Both substrings share a single digit of 1.)
