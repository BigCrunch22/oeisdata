%N A164722 Numbers whose sum of distinct prime factors is a square.
%C A164722 This is to A008472 as A051448 is to A001414. It does seem that for any given k there should be a maximum n such that the sum of the prime factors of n = k^2, and a (perhaps different) maximum n such that the sum of distinct prime factors on n = k^2.
%C A164722 If k >= 3 and p = k^2 - 2 is prime (see A028870)  then 2 * p is the term. - _Marius A. Burtea_, Jun 12 2019

%F A164722 {n such that A008472(n) is in A000290}.
%e A164722 a(7) = 66 because 66 = 2 * 3 * 11 has sum of distinct prime factors 2 + 3 + 11 = 16 = 4^2. 8748 = 2^2 * 3^7 is the largest number whose prime factors (with multiplicity) add to 25 = 5^2, but it is not in this sequence because the sum of distinct prime factors of 8748 is 2 + 3 = 5, which is not a square.
