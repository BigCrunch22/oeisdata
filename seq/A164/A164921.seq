%N A164921 a(1)=0, a(2)=1. For n >=3, a(n) = the smallest integer > a(n-1) that is coprime to every sum of any two distinct earlier terms of this sequence.
%e A164921 The first 4 terms are 0,1,2,5. The sums of every pair of distinct terms are: 0+1=1, 0+2=2, 1+2=3, 0+5=5, 1+5=6, and 2+5=7. So we are looking for the smallest integer >5 that is coprime to 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. This number, which is a(5), is 11.
