%N A164341 Irregular triangle read by rows: a(n,m) counts the decompositions into involutions of a permutation that has a cycle structure given by the m-th partition of n.
%C A164341 Partitions are in Abramowitz and Stegun ordering. First column is n. The n-th row has A000041(n) columns.
%C A164341 If a(n,m) is multiplied by weighing factor A036039(n,m) (Triangle of multinomial coefficients "M_2") then the resulting rows add to A000085(n)^2 (square of count of involutions).

%e A164341 Table begins 1; 2,2; 3,2,4; 4,3,6,4,10; 5,4,6,6,6,8,26; a(7,7)= 12 since the partition 3;3;1 represents a cycle structure of a permutation that can be decomposed into involutions in 12 ways: 3*3=9 ways by splitting each 3-cycle into a 1-cycle and a 2-cycle, and 3 more ways by combining both 3-cycles to produce three 2-cycles.
