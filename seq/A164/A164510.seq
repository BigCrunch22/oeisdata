%N A164510 First differences of A071904 (Odd composite numbers).
%C A164510 Are all terms <=6?
%C A164510 This is A067970 without its first term. [From _R. J. Mathar_, Aug 17 2009]
%C A164510 Yes, all terms are at most 6. For a value of 8, we have to have p, p+2, p+4 all prime, and this is possible only for p=3. As a result, 1 would have to be an odd composite number, which it is not. Therefore all terms are <=6. [From _J. Lowell_, Aug 17 2009]
