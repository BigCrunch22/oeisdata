%N A164832 Least nonnegative integer k such that the decimal representations of k and k+1 have n distinct digits in common.
%C A164832 Finding a(10), the final term, could be a simple but instructive puzzle.
%C A164832 a(1) through a(9) is a subsequence of A121030. a(0) through a(9) is a subsequence of A107411.
%F A164832 For 1 <= n <= 10, a(n) is the least k such that A076489(k) = n. (This would be true for n = 0 also if A076489 considered nonnegative integers, having another initial 0 term and offset 0.).
%e A164832 a(10) = 10234567889 because 10234567889 and 10234567890 have all 10 decimal digits in common and this property does not hold for any smaller positive integer.
%Y A164832 Cf. A076489, A121030, A107411.
