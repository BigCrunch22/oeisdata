%N A222180 Total number of ON states after n generations of cellular automaton based on pentagons. Also P-toothpick sequence (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A222180 Analog of A161644, A147562 and A151723, but here we are working without a lattice. Each regular pentagon has five virtual neighbors. Overlapping are prohibited. The sequence gives the number of pentagons in the structure after n-th stage. A222181 (the first differences) gives the number of pentagons added at n-th stage.
%C A222180 Also this is a P-toothpick sequence since every pentagon can be replaced by a P-toothpick which is formed by five toothpicks as a five-pointed star. Note that each toothpick can be represented as an apothem or as a radius of a pentagon. In both types of structures the number of toothpicks after n-th stage is equal to 5*a(n).
