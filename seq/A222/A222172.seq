%N A222172 Total number of ON states after n generations of cellular automaton based on pentagons starting near of the vertex of an infinite 36-degree wedge.
%C A222172 The sequence gives the number of pentagons in the structure after n-th stage. A222173 (the first differences) gives the number of pentagons added at n-th stage.
%C A222172 Also P-toothpick sequence starting near of the vertex of an infinite 36-degree wedge, since each pentagon can be replaced by a P-toothpick.
%C A222172 For more information see A222180.
%C A222172 First differs from A153000 at a(9).
