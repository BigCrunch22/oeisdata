%N A222590 Greatest prime representable as the arithmetic mean of two other primes in n different ways, or 0 if no such prime exists.
%C A222590 a(6681) is probably the only such term which equals zero.

%e A222590 There are only two primes which are not the arithmetic mean of two other primes and they are 2 and 3. Therefore a(0)=3.
%e A222590 There are only three primes which are the arithmetic mean of two other primes in just one way. They are 5 = (3+7)/2, 7 = (3+11)/2, and 19 = (7+31)/2. Therefore a(1)=19.
%e A222590 There are only three primes which are the arithmetic mean of two other primes in just two ways. They are 11 = (3+19)/2 = (5+17)/2, 13 = (3+23)/2 = (7+19)/2, and 31 = (3+59)/2 = (19+43)/2. Therefore a(2)=31, etc.
