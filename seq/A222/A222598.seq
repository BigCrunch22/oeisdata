%N A222598 Least number k having Collatz (3x+1) sequence with exactly n pairs of odd and even numbers in a row.
%C A222598 This sequence is very similar to A213215. It is somewhat surprising that many of these numbers are of the form 2^k - 1. Note that this is true for n = 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, and 33; not true for n = 1, 5, 6, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29.
%e A222598 The Collatz sequence of 15 is 15, 46, 23, 70, 35, 106, 53, 160, 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. It begins with 4 pairs of odd/even numbers.
