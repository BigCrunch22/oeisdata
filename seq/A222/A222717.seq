%N A222717 Primes p whose smallest positive quadratic nonresidue is not a primitive root of p.
%C A222717 Same as primes p such that if q is the smallest positive quadratic nonresidue mod p, then either q == 0 mod p or q^k == 1 mod p for some positive integer k < p-1.
%C A222717 A primitive root of an odd prime p is always a quadratic nonresidue mod p. (Proof. If g == x^2 mod p, then g^((p-1)/2) == x^(p-1) == 1 mod p, and so g is not a primitive root of p.) But a quadratic nonresidue mod p may or may not be a primitive root of p.
%C A222717 Supersequence of A047936 = primes whose smallest positive primitive root is not prime. (Proof. If p is not in A222717, then the smallest positive quadratic nonresidue of p is a primitive root g. Since the smallest positive quadratic nonresidue is always a prime, g is prime. But since all primitive roots are quadratic nonresidues, g is the smallest positive primitive root of p. Hence p is not in A047936.)

%e A222717 The smallest positive quadratic nonresidue of 2 is 2 itself, and 2 is not a primitive root of 2, so 2 is a member.
%e A222717 The smallest positive quadratic nonresidue of 41 is 3, and 3 is not a primitive root of 41, so 41 is a member.
