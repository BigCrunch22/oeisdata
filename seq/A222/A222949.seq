%N A222949 Numbers that are a sum of four nonzero squares where the summands have no common square factor > 1.
%C A222949 A representation of a(n) as a sum of four nonzero squares is denoted by [s(1),s(2),s(3),s(4)] with nondecreasing entries > 1 and Sum_{j=1..4} s(j)^2 = a(n). It is called primitive if gcd(s(1),s(2),s(3),s(4)) = 1. a(n) is the number with at least one such primitive representation for n, and the multiplicity m is given by the non-vanishing entries of A097203, that is A097203(a(n)).
%F A222949 A097203(a(n)) is not 0.
%e A222949 a(1) = 4 because 4 has the primitive representation [1, 1, 1, 1].
%e A222949 a(16) = 28, because 28 has the primitive representations [1, 1, 1, 5] and [1, 3, 3, 3] ([2, 2, 2, 4] is not primitive.).
