%N A222640 Hyper-lucky numbers.
%C A222640 The hyper-lucky numbers are a generalization of the lucky numbers obtained by replacing the strike-out numbers by the strike-out sets of numbers whose length is successively 1, 2, 3, ...
%C A222640 First, as a brief review, the algorithm for generating lucky numbers consists of the following steps:
%C A222640 First step: write out all the odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, ...
%C A222640 Second step: the first odd number greater than 1 is 3, so strike out every third number from the list; the survivors are 1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 19, ...
%C A222640 Third step: the first odd number greater than 3 in the list is 7, so strike out every seventh number; the survivors are 1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 21, 25, 31, ...
%C A222640 Fourth step: the first odd number greater than 7 in the list is 9, so strike out every ninth number; the survivors are 1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 21, 25, 31, ...; etc.
%C A222640 After this procedure has been carried out completely, the numbers remaining are called lucky numbers. The first few are 1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 21, 25, 31, 33, 37, ... (A000959).
%C A222640 A similar algorithm may be employed for the development of a generalization of the lucky numbers (the hyper-lucky numbers) by the following process:
%C A222640 First step: write out all the odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, ...
%C A222640 Second step: the first odd number greater than 1 is 3, so strike out every set of two numbers with the period 3 from the list by elimination of the sets {5, 7}, {11, 13}, {17, 19} ...; the survivors are 1, 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 45, 51, 57, 63, 69, ...
%C A222640 Third step: the first odd number greater than 3 in the list is 9, so strike out every set of three numbers with the period 9 from the list by elimination of the sets {45, 51, 57}, {99, 105, 111}, {153, 159, 165} ...; the survivors are 1, 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 63, 69, 75, ...
%C A222640 After this procedure has been carried out completely, the numbers remaining are called hyper-lucky numbers. The first numbers are 1, 3, 9, 15, 21, 27, 33, 39, 63, 69, 75, ...
%C A222640 Property of this sequence: for a(n) > 1, a(n) == 0 (mod 3) and a(n)/3 = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 47, 49, ...; of these, the prime numbers are 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 23, 29, 31, 47, 59, 61, 97, 101, 103, 139, 149, ...
