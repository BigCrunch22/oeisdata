%N A222192 a(n) = number of inequivalent ways to choose a subset of the n*2^(n-1) edges of the n-cube so that the resulting figure is connected and fully n-dimensional.
%C A222192 "Inequivalent" means that figures differing by a rotation and/or reflection are not regarded as different.
%C A222192 "Fully n-dimensional" means not lying in a proper subspace.
%C A222192 This is a variation on A222186, that was based on a work by the artist Sol LeWitt.
