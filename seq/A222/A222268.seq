%N A222268 Number of points defined by the lines described in A222267.
%C A222268 Given a cubic n X n X n grid of points, a collection of lines is produced by constructing a line through every pair of points. A222267 gives the count of such lines. a(n) is the total number of points of intersection of these lines, including the original n^3 points.
%e A222268 A 2 X 2 X 2 grid of points defines 28 distinct lines which intersect in a total of 15 points (including the original 8 points).
%Y A222268 A222267 is the number of lines produced from the grid of points.
