%N A222176 Total number of ON states after n generations of cellular automaton based on pentagons starting near of the vertex of an infinite 72-degree wedge.
%C A222176 The structure is one of the five wedges of A222180.
%C A222176 The sequence gives the number of pentagons in the structure after n-th stage. A222177 (the first differences) gives the number of pentagons added at n-th stage.
%C A222176 Also P-toothpick sequence starting near of the vertex of an infinite 72-degree wedge, since each pentagon can be replaced by a P-toothpick.
%C A222176 For more information see A222180.
%C A222176 First differs from A152998 at a(10).
