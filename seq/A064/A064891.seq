%N A064891 "Binary potency" of n: length of shortest blocks of 0's inserted between the bits of n required to "dilute" it into a nonprime.
%C A064891 Zero for all nonprime n. Note that the +2 dilution of 3 is not the +1 dilution of 5!
%e A064891 3 = 11 -> 0101 = 5 -> 001001 = 9, so a(3) = 2; 5 = 101 -> 010001 = 17 -> 001000001 = 65, so a(5) = 2
