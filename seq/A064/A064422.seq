%N A064422 Football league numbers: the possible point series for a league of n teams playing each other twice where for each match 3 points are awarded to the winning team and 1 to each in the case of a tie.
%C A064422 This sequence reflects the now common 3-point rule of international football where the sum of total points awarded depends on the outcome of each match. The classical 2-point rule is equivalent of that for chess tournaments (A047730).
%e A064422 For 2 teams there are 4 possible outcomes: [0, 6], [1, 4], [2, 2] and [3, 3], so a(2) = 4.
%Y A064422 Cf. A047730, A064626, A007747.
