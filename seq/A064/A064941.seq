%N A064941 Quartering a 2n X 2n chessboard (reference A257952) considering only the 90-deg rotationally symmetric results (omitting results with only 180-deg symmetry).
%H A064941 Walter Gilbert, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070624190323/http://www.otal.umd.edu/~walt/misc/Checkerboard.htm">Chessboard quartering</a>; includes generating program.
%F A064941 No formula known. However, the subset of solutions consisting of "tiles" with minimum edge lengths from a corner of the board to the center is A001700.
%F A064941 This sequence can be computed by counting paths in a graph. To compute the n-th term a graph with n X (n-1) vertices is required. Each graph vertex corresponds to 4 intersections between grid lines on the chessboard and graph edges correspond to ways of cutting the board along the grid lines. Frontier (matrix-transfer) graph path counting methods can then be applied to the graph to get the actual count. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Apr 18 2016
