%N A064521 Number of rooted 5-connected planar triangulations with 2n faces.
%C A064521 No planar triangulation can be more than 5-connected. The 5-connected triangulations are historically important to the 4-color problem.
%H A064521 Z. J. Gao, I. M. Wanless and N. C. Wormald, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jgt.1021">Counting 5-connected planar triangulations</a>, J. Graph Theory, Vol. 38 (2001), pp. 18-35.
%e A064521 The smallest 5-connected planar triangulation is the icosahedron, which has 20 faces. Because of its symmetry it has a unique rooting, so a(10)=1. The triangulations counted by a(12) and a(13) are drawn in the paper cited above.
%p A064521 # G.f. for 5-connected planar triangulations: fiveconntri(m) returns the first m terms of a power series in w, in which the coefficient of w^n is the number of (rooted) 5-connected planar triangulations with 2n faces.
