%N A064984 Triangle of coefficients T[n,m] of polynomials n, n^2, (n+2n^3)/3, n^2(2+n^2)/3, n(3+10n^2+2n^4)/15, etc. after multiplication by the denominators (A049606).
%C A064984 These polynomials are P(1, n) = 2*Sum[k, {k,1,n-1}] + n, counting up to n and down again; P(2, m) = 2*Sum[P(1,n), {n,1,m-1}] + P(1,m), meaning up and down to n and this for n from 1 up to m and down again; etc.
%e A064984 1+2+3+2+1 = 3^2, (1)+(1+2+1)+(1+2+3+2+1)+(1+2+1)+(1) = (n+2n^3)/3.

%Y A064984 Row sums give A049606 again, final entry in each row seems to give A048896.
