%N A064277 Anti-divisorial 2-decomposition values.
%C A064277 Anti-divisors are the numbers that do not divide a number with the largest possible margin. E.g. 20 has anti-divisors 3, 8 and 13. An alternative name is unbiased non-divisors. These numbers have special significance because 5 is an anti-perfect number, having anti-divisors of 2 and 3. The 2-decomposition technique involves continually finding the anti-divisors of the anti-divisors of a number, thus:
%C A064277 See A066272 for definition of anti-divisor.
%F A064277 The number of 2's is the sum of the number of 2's in the primary anti-divisorial decomposition, e.g. 20 has d(3) + d(8) + d(13) 2's by the final decomposition.

%e A064277 2. 2.2.2. 2.2.2.2.2.2
%e A064277 Therefore the value of the 2-decomposition of 20 is 10.
