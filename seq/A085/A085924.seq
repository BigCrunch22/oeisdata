%N A085924 If k = product (p_i)^(r_i), where p_i are primes in increasing order, then k is a member if concatenation of r_i as decimal numbers forms a palindrome.
%C A085924 2^10 is the first member of A072774 that is not in this sequence. - _David Wasserman_, Feb 11 2005
%C A085924 Note: A242414 is a new version of this sequence, which does not have this defect. - _Antti Karttunen_, May 30 2014
%C A085924 42 is the first member of this sequence that is not in A236510. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 27 2014
%e A085924 15 is a member as 15 = 3^1*5^1 and 11 is a palindrome.
%e A085924 90 is a member as 90 = 2^1*3^2*5^1 and 121 is a palindrome.
%e A085924 84 is not a member as 84 = 2^2*3^1*7^1, 211 is not a palindrome.
%e A085924 1024 is not a member as 1024 = 2^10, and decimal number string "10" is not a palindrome.
%Y A085924 Differs from a non-base version of this sequence, A242414, in that here terms like 1024 are excluded (please see the Example section), while in latter, A242414(691) = 1024.
