%N A085898 Group the natural numbers such that the product of the n-th group is divisible by 2^n. (1), (2) (3,4), (5,6,7,8), (9,10,11,12,13,14,),(15,16,17,18),... Sequence contains highest power of 2 that divides the product of the terms of the n-th group. a(n) =k, where A085895(n)/(2^k) is the smallest possible integer. By definition a(n) > or = n.
%e A085898 a(7) = 9, as the 7th group terms are (25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32) and the highest power of 2 that divides the product is 2^9.
%Y A085898 Cf. A085895, A085896, A085897.
