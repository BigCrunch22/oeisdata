%N A085082 Number of distinct prime signatures arising among the divisors of n.
%C A085082 For a squarefree number n with k distinct prime divisors, a(n) = k+1.
%C A085082 If n = p^r then a(n) = tau(n) = r+1.
%C A085082 Question: Find a(n) in the following cases:
%C A085082 1. n = m^k where m is a squarefree number with r distinct prime divisors.
%C A085082 2. n = Product_{i=1..r} (p_i)^i, where p_i is the i-th distinct prime divisor of n.
%C A085082 Answers: 1. (r+k)!/(r!k!). 2. A000108(r+1). - _David Wasserman_, Jan 20 2005
%C A085082 I have submitted comments for A000108 and A016098 that each include a combinatorial statement equivalent to the second problem and its solution. - _Matthew Vandermast_, Nov 22 2010

%e A085082 a(30) = 4 and the divisors with distinct prime signatures are 1, 2, 6 and 30. The divisors 3 and 5 with the same prime signature as of 2 and the divisors 10 and 15 with the same prime signature as that of 6 are not counted.
%e A085082 The divisors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12 and 36. We can group them as (1), (2, 3), (6), (4, 9), (12, 18), (36) so that every group contains divisors with the same prime signature and we have a(36) = 6.
