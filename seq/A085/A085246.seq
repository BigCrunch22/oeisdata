%N A085246 Satisfies a(1)=1, a(A026835(n+1)) = a(n)+1, with a(m)=0 for all m not found in A026835, where A026835(n+2)=A026835(n+1)+a(n)+1.
%C A085246 Removing the leading '1' and all zeros results in the original sequence with every term incremented by 1.
%F A085246 Records occur at 2^n: a(2^n)=n+1.
%e A085246 Initialize all terms to zero. Set a(1)=1, go one term forward,
%e A085246 set a(2)=a(1)+1=2, go 2 terms forward,
%e A085246 set a(4)=a(2)+1=3, go 3 terms forward,
%e A085246 set a(7)=a(3)+1=1, go 1 term forward,
%e A085246 set a(8)=a(4)+1=4, go 4 terms forward,
%e A085246 set a(12)=a(5)+1=1, etc.
%e A085246 The indices 1,2,4,7,8,12,... form A085262.
