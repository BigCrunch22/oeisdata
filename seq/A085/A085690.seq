%N A085690 Number of intersections between a sphere inscribed in a cube and the n X n X n cubes resulting from a cubic lattice subdivision of the enclosing cube.
%C A085690 A concise description of the problem is given by Clive Tooth in the Seaman, Tooth link. Sequence terms up to n=10 were first given by Dave Seaman. Cubes having at least one vertex on the sphere and all other vertices either all inside or all outside the sphere are counted as 1/2. a(n) is asymptotic to (3/2)*Pi*n^2. (Clive Tooth) The terms a(2),...,a(6) are identical with A005897(n-1) (points on surface of cube with square grid on its faces).

%e A085690 a(2)=8 because all 8 cubes resulting from a 2*2*2 subdivision of a cube are intersected by a sphere inscribed in the large cube.
%e A085690 a(4)=56: 8 central cubes of 4*4*4=64 not intersected.
