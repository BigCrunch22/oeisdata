%N A085098 a(n) = number of solutions (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) to Product_{i=1..n} (1 + 1/x_i) = 2.
%C A085098 Number of ways 2 is a product of n superparticular ratios, without regard to order. A superparticular ratio is a ratio of the form m/(m-1). The question relates to music theory, in that various permutations of these products result in scales. - _Gene Ward Smith_, Apr 11 2006
%e A085098 For n = 1, a(1) = 1, one solution: {x_1} = {1}.
%e A085098 For n = 2, a(2) = 1, one solution: {x_1, x_2} = {2, 3}.
%e A085098 For n = 3, a(3) = 5, five solutions: {x_1, x_2, x_3} = {3, 4, 5}, {3, 3, 8}, {2, 4, 15}, {2, 5, 9}, {2, 6, 7}.
%e A085098 In other words, a(3) = 5 since 2 can be written as (4/3)^2 (9/8), (4/3)(5/4)(6/5), (3/2)(7/6)(8/7), (3/2)(6/5)(10/9) or (3/2)(5/4)(16/15) but in no other way using superparticular rations.
