%N A085813 Number of cards that need to be drawn (with replacement) from a deck of n cards to have a 95% or greater chance of seeing each card at least once.
%C A085813 The probability that there are at most k different cards in t drawings is (k/m)^t * binomial(m,k). This also includes the cases with k-1 different cards, which we want to subtract. Inclusion and exclusion leads to the formula Sum_{k=1..m} (-1)^(m-k) * (k/m)^t * binomial(m,k).
%e A085813 a(2)=6 because you have to throw a coin 6 times to get both sides at least once with probability greater than or equal to 0.95. (The probability of getting only one side in a series of 6 throws is (1/2)^6 * 2 = 1/32 = 0.03125 < 0.05.)
%e A085813 a(6)=27 because you have to roll a die 27 times to see all 6 possible outcomes with a probability over 0.95. (If you roll a die 27 times, the probability of getting all 6 sides at least once is 0.95658638... . If you roll the die only 26 times, the probability is 0.94798274... .)
%t A085813 f[1] = 1; f[n_] := f[n] = Block[{k = f[n - 1]}, While[ 2StirlingS2[k, n]*n!/n^k < 19/10, k++ ]; k]; Table[ f[n], {n, 1, 56}]
%Y A085813 Cf. A073593 (number of drawings for a 50% probability of seeing each card, = median) and A060293 (expected value of the number of drawings until each card is drawn once).
%Y A085813 Cf. A090582.
