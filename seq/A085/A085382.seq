%N A085382 Sum of prime p and largest prime divisor of p-1.
%C A085382 There are few primes in this sequence. They the upper member of twin prime pairs of the form 2^x+1,2^x+3. since we are subtracting 1 from p this is only way a largest even prime divisor can occur namely 2 to add to a prime to get a prime which if it too is prime it will be a twin prime. The next one after 7,19 shown is 2^16+3 = 65539.
%o A085382 (PARI) cminuspm2(n) = \ prime + maxprime of prime-1 { forprime(x=5,n, forstep(p=x,2,-1, if(isprime(p) & (x-1)%p==0,print1(x+p,","); break); ) ) }
