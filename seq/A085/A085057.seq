%N A085057 a(n) is the smallest integer of the form a*b*c.../p*q*r..., where the numerator and the denominator contain n numbers each and a,b,c,...p,q,r... are all the integers from 1 to 2n.
%C A085057 The largest value of the ratio is C(2n, n). a(4) = 70 is the smallest as well as the largest such integer. The smallest number can arise in more than one ways. i.e. a(3) = (2*5*6)/(1*3*4) = (3*4*5)/(1*2*6) = 5.
%C A085057 a(n) is bounded below by the squarefree part of (2n)! and above by C(2n, n). When those bounds are equal, that is a(n); for example, a(4) = 70. When a(n) equals that lower bound, it is fairly easy to compute. That happens for all of the first 3400 terms, anyway.
%C A085057 Conjecture: a(n) always equals that lower bound. - _Don Reble_, Jul 01 2003
%e A085057 a(3) = (2*5*6)/(1*3*4) = 5. a(5) = (1*7*8*9*10)/(2*3*4*5*6) = 7.
%Y A085057 This is conjectured to be the same as A069113; they agree for at least the first 3400 terms.
