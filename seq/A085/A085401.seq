%N A085401 a(0) = 1; a(n+1) is the smallest positive number (of at most two) such that abs(a(n) - a(n+1)) is the smallest prime not occurring earlier as difference of successive terms and a(n) + a(n+1) is composite.
%C A085401 There are numbers which occur more than once, e.g. a(6) = a(42) = 18, a(8) = a(40) = 20.
%C A085401 Problem: Does every positive integer eventually occur?
%e A085401 a(4) = 14; the smallest prime not occurring earlier as difference of successive terms is 7; there are two numbers x such that abs(14 - x) = 7 and 14 + x is composite, namely x = 7 and x = 21. The smaller of these numbers is 7, so a(5) = 7.
%e A085401 a(11) = 51; the smallest prime not occurring earlier as difference of successive terms is 31; there are two numbers x such that abs(51 - x) = 31, namely x = 20 and x = 82 and 51 + 20 = 71 is not composite while 51 + 82 = 133 is composite;
%e A085401 hence a(12) = 82.
