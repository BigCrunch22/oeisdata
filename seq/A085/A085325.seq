%N A085325 a(n) is the least number m such that the minimal exponent for which reverse(m^n) = prime holds is n. Thus reverse(m^k) is composite for k = 1, .., n-1.

%e A085325 For n = 10, a(10) = 53: This means that reverse(53^10) = 940315563074788471 is prime, but reverse(53^k) is composite for k=1, ..., 9. Also, reverse(m^10) for m < a(10) = 53 is not prime. However m > 53 is possible like, e.g., reverse(103^10) is prime. 10 as the least exponent belongs to several bases of which a(10) = 53 is the smallest one.
