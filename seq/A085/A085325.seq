%N A085325 a(n) is the least number such that the minimal exponent for which rev[a(n)^n]=prime holds is n. Thus rev[a(n)^k] is composite for k=1,..n.
%e A085325 n=10, a(10)=53: This means that rev[53^10]=940315563074788471 is prime, but rev[53^k] is composite for k=1,...,9. Also, rev[a^10] for a<a(n)=53 is not prime. However a>53 is possible like e.g rev[103^10] is prime; 10 as the least exponent belongs to several bases of which a(10)=53 is the smallest one.
