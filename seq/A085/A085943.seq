%N A085943 Let S = 123456789101112131415..., the concatenation of the natural numbers; partition this string into distinct squarefree numbers. To avoid leading zeros, no number may end at the digit that comes before a 0 in S.
%e A085943 a(18) = 27282 because 27282 is squarefree, while 27, 272 and 2728 are not and 2 has already been used.
%e A085943 a(19) = 930 because 9 is not squarefree and 93 would cause a(20) to have a leading 0.
