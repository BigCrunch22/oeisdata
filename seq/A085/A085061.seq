%N A085061 a(0) = 1; a(n+1) is the largest positive number (of at most two) such that abs(a(n) - a(n+1)) is the smallest prime not occurring earlier as difference of successive terms and a(n) + a(n+1) is composite.
%C A085061 Conjecture 1: a(n+5) > a(n).
%C A085061 Conjecture 2: There are no numbers which occur more than once.
%e A085061 a(4) = 14; the smallest prime not occurring earlier as difference of successive terms is 7; there are two numbers x such that abs(14 - x) = 7 and 14 + x is composite, namely x = 7 and x = 21. The larger of these numbers is 21, so a(5) = 21.
%e A085061 a(5) = 21; the smallest primes not occurring earlier as difference of successive terms are 11 and 17; there are two numbers x such that abs(21 - x) = 11, namely x = 10 and x = 32, but neither 21 + 10 = 31 nor 21 + 32 = 53 is composite;
%e A085061 there are two numbers x such that abs(21 - x) = 17, namely x = 4 and x = 38 and 21 + 38 = 59 is not composite while 21 + 4 = 25 is composite; hence a(6) = 4.
