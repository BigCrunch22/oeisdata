%N A085956 Smallest prime p such that (2n)*p +1 and (p-1)/(2n) are prime, or 0 if no such prime exists.
%C A085956 Primes of the form 16*p + 1 == {1, 7, 13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43, 49, 55, 61, 67, 73, 79, 85, 91} (mod 96).
%C A085956 With rare exceptions, a(3n-1)=0. a(2)=13, a(5)=31 and a(35)=211, all of which are of the form 6n+1. This is true for those 6317 n's which have a solutions less than 10^6. I have no proof! - _Robert G. Wilson v_
%e A085956 a(5) = 31 as (2*5)*31 + 1= 311 as well as (31-1)/10 = 3 are primes.
