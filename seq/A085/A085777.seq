%N A085777 Semiprimes such that when they are concatenated with their reversal are semiprime.
%C A085777 This is to A001358 = semiprimes (or biprimes): products of two primes, as A054217 is to primes A000040. Note that a subsequence is the emirpimes (A097393) which, when concatenated with their digital reversals, become different semiprimes. Examples of this subsequence: 94, 115, 169, 185, ... because 9449 = 11 * 859, 115511 = 11 * 10501, 169961 = 11 * 15451, 185581 = 11 * 16871. [From _Jonathan Vos Post_, Apr 05 2010]
%F A085777 {positive integers s = p*q in A001358, p and q primes, such that Concatenate(s, R(s)) = u*v is in A001358, u and v primes} = {positive integers s = p*q in A001358, p and q primes, such that Concatenate(s, A004086(s)) = u*v is in A001358, u and v primes}.
