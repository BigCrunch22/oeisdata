%N A085824 Numbers n such that the smallest prime containing exactly n 0's (A037053) requires only two nonzero digits.
%C A085824 In the first one thousand primes containing exactly n zeros, 140 use just two digits. 1008 is in the sequence.
%C A085824 Although this sequence probably thins out like the primes, it is infinite.
%C A085824 For indices n listed here (and no others), A037053(n) = a*10^(n+1)+b with a in {1,...,9} and b in {1, 3, 7, 9}. The sequence of numbers *not* in this sequence is 13, 22, 29, 31, 32, 33, 40, 42, 43, ... - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 19 2016
