%N A085096 Index of the first occurrence of n in A082744, or 0 if n does not occur in the sequence A082744.
%C A085096 Conjecture: a(11) = 0, or in other words,if 11k+1 is a palindrome then at least one of the numbers in the sequence k+1,2k+1, 3k+1,...,10k+1 is also a palindrome. E.g. for k = 10 and k = 55, 11k+1 is a palindrome but 10*1 +1 and 55*2 +1 are also palindromes.
