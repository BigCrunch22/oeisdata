%N A085929 Smaller of two consecutive numbers with the same prime signature not occurring earlier.
%C A085929 The order of the exponents in the prime factorization is not significant (compare A091405).
%C A085929 Conjecture: (1) The sequence is infinite. (2) For every prime signature other than perfect powers, there exists a number k such that k+1 also has the same prime signature.
%C A085929 Up to at least 3*10^8, all numbers in this sequence have signatures with some prime to power 1 (for example, p^2*q^3 does not appear), casting some doubt on the second conjecture. - _Joseph Myers_, Feb 24 2004
