%N A085081 Group the natural numbers such that the product of the terms of the n-th group has a divisor with the same prime signature as that of the product of the terms of the (n-1)-th group. (1), (2), (3), (4), (5,6,7,8), (9,10,11,12,13,14),... Sequence contains the product of the terms of the groups.
%C A085081 In most cases when n >3 a(n) is a multiple of a(n-1). Question: is it true for all n >3.
%C A085081 For 6 <= n <= 13, a(n) doesn't divide a(n+1). I believe this also holds for all larger n. - _David Wasserman_, Jan 18 2005
%e A085081 a(5) = 2162160 = 2^4*3^3*5*7*11*13 and a(4) = 1680= 2^4*3*5*7.
%e A085081 a(4) itself divides a(5).
