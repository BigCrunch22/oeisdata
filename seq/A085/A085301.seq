%N A085301 Number of factorials between two primorials.
%C A085301 Seems provable: a(n) > 0 for all n; seems more difficult to prove (if true at all) that a(n)=1 or 2; for n < 2050 it holds. Stirling's approximation and Prime Number Theorem together may help.
%F A085301 a(n) = Card[{k; q(n) <= k! <= q(n+1)}, where q(j) = A002110(j), the j-th primorial; closed intervals required only for n=1, 2.
%e A085301 n=1: between 1st (=2) and 2nd (=6) primorials, the factorials 2!=2 and 3!=6 occur, so a(1)=2;
%e A085301 n=2: between the primorials 6 and 30, the factorials 3!=6 and 4!=24 occur, so a(2)=2.
%e A085301 Factorial and primorial sets coincide only in case of n = 1,2: {2,6}.
%e A085301 If n > 3, factorials are never squarefree; but primorials are always squarefree, so they are disjoint.
%e A085301 n=5: between the 5th and 6th primorials 2310 and 30030, only the factorial 7!=5040 occurs;
%e A085301 n=6: between the primorials 30030 and 510510, the factorials 8!=40320 and 9!=362880 occur.
