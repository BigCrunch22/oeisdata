%N A316793 Numbers whose prime multiplicities are distinct and relatively prime.
%C A316793 A subsequence of A007916.
%e A316793 60 = 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^1 has prime multiplicities (2,1,1), which are relatively prime but not distinct, so 60 does not belong to the sequence.
%e A316793 72 = 2^3 * 3^2 has prime multiplicities (3,2), which are distinct and relatively prime, so 72 belongs to the sequence.
%e A316793 144 = 2^4 * 3^2 has prime multiplicities (4,2), which are distinct but not relatively prime, so 144 does not belong to the sequence.
