%N A316554 Triangle read by rows: number of Boolean functions in n variables, of algebraic degree d, with the property that at least one of their discrete derivatives has degree strictly smaller than d-1 (d-1 is maximum possible degree).
%C A316554 Boolean functions in n variables (n bits input, one bit output) are viewed in their algebraic normal form (ANF), i.e., as polynomial functions over F_2 (the finite field of integers modulo 2), of degree at most one in each variable.
%C A316554 The functions are counted up to equivalence: two functions are defined as equivalent if they both have the same degree d and their difference is a polynomial function of degree d-1.
%C A316554 The discrete derivative of f in direction (a_1,...,a_n) is defined as f(x_1+a_1,...,x_n+a_n) - f(x_1,...,x_n); if f has degree d, its derivatives have degree d-1 or less.
%C A316554 We count the functions which have at least one derivative of degree strictly less than d-1.
%C A316554 This is a triangular array, indexed by (n,d), with d=1..n. It is written row by row, starting with n=1.
%C A316554 Note that in the Formula section we denoted by qbinomial(n,k,q) the Gaussian binomial coefficients, or q-binomial coefficients; we use the values for q=2, which are sequence A022166. Both formulae were proven in the reference.
