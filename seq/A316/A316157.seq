%N A316157 Positive integers Q such that there is a cubic x^3 - Qx + R that has three real roots whose continued fraction expansion have common tails.
%C A316157 After 3, the prime terms appear to be the primes in A275878 (namely, 7, 61, 331, 547, 1951, ...)

%e A316157 For the first entry of Q=3, we have the polynomial x^3 - 3x + 1. Its roots, expressed as continued fractions, all have a common tail of 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 6, 11, ... The next examples are Q=7 with the polynomial x^3 - 7x + 7, then Q=9 with the polynomial x^3 - 9x + 9, and Q=21 with the polynomials x^3 - 21x + 35 and x^3 - 21x + 37. Note that for the Q=7 example, we get the common tail of 2, 3, 1, 6, 10, 5, ... which is contained in A039921.
