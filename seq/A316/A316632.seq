%N A316632 a(n) is the Sprague-Grundy value of the Node-Kayles game on the 3 X n lattice graph.
%C A316632 The Node-Kayles game on the 1 X n lattice graph (i.e., path) is equivalent to the Dawson's chess game and thus produces the same Sprague-Grundy values as A002187.
%C A316632 The Node-Kayles game on the 2 X n lattice graph (i.e., ladder graph) produces the Sprague-Grundy values 1,0,1,0,1,0,..., which are periodic with period 2 (A000035).
%C A316632 The Node-Kayles game on the 4 X n lattice graph produces the Sprague-Grundy values 0,0,0,0,0,..., which are constantly 0 (A000004).

%e A316632 a(1) is the Sprague-Grundy value of the Node-Kayles game played on the 3 X 1 lattice graph, which is a path of length 3. Hence, a(1)=2, which is the third term in the sequence A002187.
%e A316632 a(2) is the Sprague-Grundy value of the Node-Kayles game played on the 3 X 2 lattice graph, which is a ladder with three rungs. The first player has two possible moves: to color the a corner vertex, which has degree 2, or to color a vertex with degree 3. If the player colors a vertex of degree 2, the resultant graph is a path of length 3. As mentioned before, the Sprague-Grundy value of the Node-Kayles game played on a path of length 3 is 2. If the player colors a vertex of degree 3, the resultant graph consists of two isolated vertices. The Sprague-Grundy value of the Node-Kayles game played on two isolated vertices is 0. Hence, a(2) = mex{0,2} = 1, where mex is the minimum excluded function.
