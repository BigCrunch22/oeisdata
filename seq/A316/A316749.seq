%N A316749 A self-"read and extend" sequence built following the rules given in the Comments section.
%C A316749 Start with a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 2; read the sequence digit by digit starting from the left:
%C A316749 when the read digit is smaller than the next one, multiply by 2 the last integer of the sequence and extend it with the result;
%C A316749 when the read digit is bigger than the next one, subtract 1 from the last integer of the sequence and extend it with the result;
%C A316749 when both digits are equal, extend the sequence with the smallest integer not present so far.

%e A316749 As the only digit of a(1) = 1 is smaller than 2 (the next digit), we extend the sequence with 4 (that is, 2 times 2);
%e A316749 as the only digit of a(2) = 2 is smaller than 4 (the next digit), we extend the sequence with 8 (that is, 2 times 4);
%e A316749 as the only digit of a(3) = 4 is smaller than 8 (the next digit), we extend the sequence with 16 (that is, 2 times 8);
%e A316749 as the only digit of a(4) = 8 is bigger than 1 (the next digit), we extend the sequence with 15 (that is, 16 minus 1);
%e A316749 as the first digit of a(5) = 1 is smaller than 6 (the next digit), we extend the sequence with 30 (that is, 2 times 15);
%e A316749 as the last digit of a(5) = 6 is bigger than 1 (the next digit), we extend the sequence with 29 (that is, 30 minus 1);
%e A316749 ...
%e A316749 as the first digit of a(12) = 1 is equal to 1 (the next digit), we extend the sequence with 3 (this is the smallest integer not yet present in the sequence and is written after a(23) = 1777);
%e A316749 etc.
