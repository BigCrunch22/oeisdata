%e A316992 6 is in the sequence since gcd(6, 15) = 3 and 6 does not divide 15^e with integer e >= 0.
%e A316992 2 and 4 are not in the sequence since they are coprime to 15.
%e A316992 3 and 5 are not in the sequence since they are divisors of 15.
%e A316992 9 is not in the sequence since 9 | 15^2.
