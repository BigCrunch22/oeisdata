%N A316222 Number of positive subset-sum triangles whose composite is a positive subset-sum of an integer partition of n.
%C A316222 A positive subset-sum is a pair (h,g), where h is a positive integer and g is an integer partition, such that some submultiset of g sums to h. A triangle consists of a root sum r and a sequence of positive subset-sums ((h_1,g_1),...,(h_k,g_k)) such that the sequence (h_1,...,h_k) is weakly decreasing and has a submultiset summing to r.
%e A316222 We write positive subset-sum triangles in the form rootsum(branch,...,branch). The a(2) = 5 positive subset-sum triangles:
%e A316222   2(2(2))
%e A316222   1(1(1,1))
%e A316222   2(2(1,1))
%e A316222   1(1(1),1(1))
%e A316222   2(1(1),1(1))
%Y A316222 Cf. A063834, A262671, A269134, A276024, A281113, A301934, A301935, A316219, A316220.
