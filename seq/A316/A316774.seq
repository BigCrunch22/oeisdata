%N A316774 a(n) = n for n < 2, a(n) = freq(a(n-1),n) + freq(a(n-2),n) for n >= 2, where freq(i,j) is the number of times i appears in [a(0),a(1),...,a(j-1)].
%C A316774 In other words, a(n) = (number of times a(n-1) has appeared) plus (number of times a(n-2) has appeared). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 13 2019
%C A316774 What is the asymptotic behavior of this sequence?
%C A316774 Does it contain every positive integer at least once?
%C A316774 Does it contain every positive integer at most finitely many times?
%C A316774 Additional comments from Peter Illig's "Puzzles" link below (Start):
%C A316774 Sometimes referred to as "The Devil's Sequence" (by me), due to the early presence of three consecutive 6's (and my inability to understand it). The next time a number occurs three times in a row isn't until a(355677).
%C A316774 If each n does appear only finitely many times, approximately how many times does it appear? (It seems to be close to 2n.)
%C A316774 What are the best possible upper/lower bounds on a(n)?
%C A316774 Let r(k) be the smallest n such that {0,1,2,...,k} is contained in {a(0),...,a(n)}. What is the asymptotic behavior of r(k)? (It seems to be close to k^2/2.)
