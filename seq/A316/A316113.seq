%e A316113 a(12) = 22 because the tuple [3, 3, 4, 12] has the sum of reciprocals 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/12 = 1 of which the denominator is 1 and has no common prime factors with n = 12.
%e A316113 a(25) = 110 because the tuple [5, 5, 25, 25, 50] has the sum of reciprocals 1/5 + 1/5 + 1/25 + 1/25 + 1/50 = 1/2 of which the denominator is 2 and has no common prime factors with n = 25.
