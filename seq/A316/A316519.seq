%N A316519 a(n) is the number of distinct nonzero values frac(n/k) can take for k in 1..n, where frac denotes the fractional part.
%C A316519 This sequence arises for instance in the following circumstances: let (C_k)_k be the circles with center (0, k) and radius k, k positive integer. n represents time (n >= 0, real for now). For each k, a mobile point M(n, k) (hereafter called k) belongs to C_k. Initially located at (0, 0), k moves counterclockwise at speed 2*Pi. It can be shown that at time n, all k are located on the curve S with polar equation rho = 2*Pi*n*sinc(theta), theta >= 0. When n is a positive integer, a natural and visual classification of points into 3 subsets crops up: the k divisors of n, superposed at (0, 0); the k nondivisors of n such that 1 < k < n, located on the loops of S; the k greater than n, located on the open branch of S. If, for each k in the second subset, one draws the line that passes through (0, 0) and k, then a(n) is the number of distinct lines obtained. In general a(n) is not equal to n - d(n), where d(n) denotes the number of divisors of n, because some k may align. See provided illustration for a(9)=5, section Links. It can be shown that alignment of k1 and k2 occurs iff the condition frac(n/k1) = frac(n/k2) is satisfied.
