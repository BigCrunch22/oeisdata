%N A316456 Complete list of solutions to y^2 = x^3 - 7x + 10; sequence gives x values.
%C A316456 Bremner and Tzanakis showed that the list of solutions is complete.
%C A316456 The elliptic curve given by this equation has rank 2 over the rationals with generators (1, 2) and (2, 2).
%C A316456 Since there exist two integer points (x, y) and (x, -y) for each x in the sequence (we can easily see that y <> 0 for such an x), this elliptic curve has exactly 26 integer points.
