%N A316745 Numbers expressible as A*B^A in three or more different ways, with A, B > 1.
%C A316745 Since a number can't be expressed simultaneously as 2*t^2 and 4*u^4, any number in this sequence must have a representation with A >= 5.
%C A316745 Up to 10^52, the only two terms not of the form 2*k^2 are 3*41841412812^3 = 4*86093442^4 = 64*3^64 and 3*54043195528445952^3 = 4*3298534883328^4 = 81*4^81.
%C A316745 From _Charlie Neder_, Jul 21 2018: (Start)
%C A316745 For each prime p and each value of A, the p-adic valuation of n must be congruent to the p-adic valuation of A modulo A. As a consequence, if two numbers k and m have greatest common divisor g and at least one of (k/g)^(1/g) or (m/g)^(1/g) is not an integer then no number n can have both A = k and A = m since this would lead to an unsolvable system of modular congruences.
%C A316745 If a number n is in this sequence with corresponding A-values {a,b,c}, then n*k^lcm(a,b,c) is also in this sequence for all k. Of the first 1198 terms, 949 of these are of the form 344373768*k^24, and 164 more are of the form 30233088000000*k^30. As values of n get larger, the proportion of primitive values rapidly decreases. (End)
