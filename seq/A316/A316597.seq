%N A316597 Heinz numbers of integer partitions that are not totally nondecreasing.
%C A316597 The first term of this sequence that is absent from A112769 is 150.
%C A316597 An integer partition is totally nondecreasing if either it is empty or a singleton or its multiplicities (where if x < y the multiplicity of x is counted prior to the multiplicity of y) are weakly increasing and, taken in reverse order, are themselves a totally nondecreasing integer partition.
%e A316597 150 is the Heinz number of (3,3,2,1), with multiplicities (1,1,2), which has multiplicities (2,1), which are decreasing, so 150 does not belong to the sequence.
%Y A316597 Complement of A316529.
