%N A316787 Semipermutable Primes: One-digit primes and primes with 2 or more digits such that all permutations of their digits are primes except for permutations that place either 5 or even numbers in the units digit.
%C A316787 Supersequence of A003459. The motivation of the sequence is to fill gaps in A003459.
%C A316787 The sequence contains all 1-digit primes, 20 2-digit primes (i.e., all 2-digit primes except 19), as opposed to only 9 2-digit primes in A003459, and 66 3-digit primes (as opposed to only 9 3-digit primes in A003459).
%C A316787 Also, the sequence contains 4-digit primes such as 4441 but also nontrivial ones such as 1181, 1811, 8111, which form an orbit of size 3 (see below), while there are no 4-digit primes in A003459.
%C A316787 If we call orbits the primes that can be obtained by such permutations, there are orbits of sizes 1,2,3, and 4 up to 3-digit primes.
%C A316787 In fact, there are only 3 orbits of size 4 up to 3-digit primes: {107, 17, 71, 701}, {149, 419, 491, 941} and {709, 79, 97, 907}.
%C A316787 It appears that there are no orbits of sizes larger than 4 for n-digit primes.
%C A316787 Permutations that have leading 0's are included: thus 409 is not in the sequence because 49 is not prime. - _Robert Israel_, Aug 31 2018

%e A316787 127 is not in the sequence since 271 is prime but neither 217 nor 721 are; to be in the sequence all of these numbers would have to be prime, and they would form an orbit of size 4 (by Name, permutations of these numbers ending in 2 are not considered).
%e A316787 241 and 421 are in the sequence and form an orbit of size 2 since these primes can be obtained by permutations that forbid the units digit to be an even number.
%e A316787 569 and 659 are in the sequence since these primes can be obtained by permutations that forbid the units digit to be either 5 or an even number.
