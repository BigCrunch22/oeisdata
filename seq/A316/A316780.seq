%N A316780 a(n) is the least positive integer k such that ceiling(sqrt(A046315(n)*k))^2 - A046315(n)*k is a square.
%C A316780 Fermat's factorization helper multiplier for the n-th odd semiprime.
%C A316780 a(n) is the least positive integer such that A046315(n) * a(n) can be factorized with a single iteration of Fermat's factorization method. Using the factorization of a(n), we can then deduce the prime factors of A046315(n). Example for n = 35490: A046315(n) = 199163 and a(n) = 40; ceiling(sqrt(199163*40)) = 2823; 199163*40 = 2823^2 - 2809 = 2823^2 - 53^2 = (2823+53)(2823-53) = 2876*2770, leading to 199163*(2*2*2*5) = (2*2*719)*(2*5*277) and eventually 199163 = 719*277.
%e A316780 a(18) = 7 because the 18th odd semiprime is A046315(18) = 93, ceiling(sqrt(93*7))^2 - 93*7 = 25 is a perfect square and 7 is the least positive integer for which this holds.
