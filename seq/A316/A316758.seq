%N A316758 A self-"read and extend" sequence built following the rules visible in the Comments section.
%C A316758 Start with a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 2; read the sequence digit by digit starting from the left:
%C A316758 when the read digit is smaller than the next one, double the last integer of the sequence and extend the sequence with the result rearranged (smallest digits first and leading zeros erased);
%C A316758 when the read digit is bigger than the next one, double the last integer of the sequence and extend the sequence with the result rearranged (biggest digits first, zeros at the end);
%C A316758 when both digits are equal, do a circular permutation of the last integer of the sequence and extend the sequence with the result (this will erase a few zeros in some cases, as 100023850 becomes 238501).

%e A316758 As the only digit of a(1) = 1 is smaller than 2 (the next digit), we extend the sequence with 4 (that is 2 times 2);
%e A316758 as the only digit of a(2) = 2 is smaller than 4 (the next digit), we extend the sequence with 8 (that is 2 times 4);
%e A316758 as the only digit of a(3) = 4 is smaller than 8 (the next digit), we extend the sequence with 16 (that is 2 times 8 -- with 1 coming before 6);
%e A316758 as the only digit of a(4) = 8 is bigger than 1 (the next digit), we extend the sequence with 32 (that is 2 times 16 -- with 3 coming before 2);
%e A316758 as the first digit of a(5) = 1 is smaller than 6 (the next digit), we extend the sequence with 46 (that is 2 times 32 = 64 that is rearranged in 46);
%e A316758 as the last digit of a(5) = 6 is bigger than 3 (the next digit), we extend the sequence with 92 (that is 2 times 46 = 92 rearranged in 29);
%e A316758 . . .
%e A316758 as the last digit of a(9) = 1 is equal to 1 (the next digit), we extend the sequence with 554219 (this is the circular permutation of the previous term, 955421);
%e A316758 etc.
%Y A316758 Cf. A316749 and A316750 (for other sets of "read and extend" rules).
