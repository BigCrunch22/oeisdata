%N A316792 a(n) is the least prime p such that the second forward difference of three consecutive primes p, q and r is n = -(p - 2q + r)/2.
%C A316792 Inspired by A295973.
%C A316792 Except for the first three primes {2, 3, 5}, all sfds are even.
%C A316792 The only other sfd which is not covered by this sequence is when the primes are {2, 3, 5} which results in an sfd of 1.
%C A316792 Except for an sfd of 0 or 1, all values of sfd occur infinitely often.
%C A316792 As an example, sfd = -2 for p = 7, 13, 31, 37, 61, 67, 73, 97, 103, 157, 193, 223, 271, 277, 307, ..., .

%e A316792 a(0) = 3 since the three consecutive primes {3, 5, 7} have an sfd of 0;
%e A316792 a(1) = 7 since the three consecutive primes {7, 11, 13} have a sfd of -2;
%e A316792 a(2) = 23 since the three consecutive primes {23, 29, 31} have a sfd of -4;
%e A316792 a(3) = 1531 since the three consecutive primes {1531, 1543, 1549} have an sfd of -6;
%e A316792 a(4) =  since the three consecutive primes {} have an sfd of -8; etc.
