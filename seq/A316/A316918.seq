%N A316918 For any k, the cumulative sum a(1) + a(2) + a(3) + ... + a(k) starts with a(k). Lexicographic first sequence of positive integers without duplicate terms having this property and extending itself forever.
%C A316918 The authors conjecture that it is impossible to extend the sequence forever if a(1) < 61.
%C A316918 With a(1) = 60, for instance, we will be stuck with the integer 5:
%C A316918 60,6,7,8,9,10,1,11,12,13,15,16,18,20,2,23,25,28,31,3,35,39,43,4,48,54,5 STOP (no unused integer can extend the sequence).
%C A316918 See here the sequence starting with a(1) = 60 and the cumulative sums:
