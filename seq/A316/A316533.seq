%N A316533 a(n) is the Sprague-Grundy value of the Node-Kayles game played on the generalized Petersen graph P(n,2).
%C A316533 For all values of n, the Sprague-Grundy values of the Node-Kayles game played on the generalized Petersen graph P(n,2) cannot be greater than 2 since there exist only 2 non-isomorphic first moves.
%C A316533 Furthermore, for all even values of n, the generalized Petersen graph P(n,2) has an automorphism defined by a rotation of 180 degrees. Hence, for every move by player 1, player 2 can respond by coloring the orbit-equivalent point of player 1's move. Thus, the Sprague-Grundy value of the Node-Kayles game played on P(n,2) is 0 when n is even.

%e A316533 For n=5, a(5) is the Sprague-Grundy value of the Node-Kayles game played on the Petersen graph. Since the Petersen graph is vertex transitive, all first moves are isomorphic. After the first move, the resultant graph is the cycle C_6. The Sprague-Grundy value of the Node-Kayles game played on C_6 is 0. Hence, a(5) = mex{0} = 1, where mex is the minimum excluded function.
