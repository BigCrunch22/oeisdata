%N A316764 A self-"read and extend" sequence built following the rules visible in the Comments section (a kind of Collatz-by-digits sequence).
%C A316764 Start with a(1) = 3 and read the sequence digit-by-digit starting from the left:
%C A316764 when the read digit is odd, we triple the last term of the sequence and add 1, then extend the sequence with the result;
%C A316764 when the read digit is even, we divide by 2 the last term of the sequence, then extend the sequence with the entire part of the result. Starting the sequence with a(1) = 1 or a(1) = 2 would generate the infinite (and rather uninteresting) sequence 1,4,2,1,4,2,1,4,2,1,4,2,1,...
%C A316764 It is not known by the authors if the sequence starting with a(1) = 3 comes back to 1, enters in another loop than [1,4,2,1] or extends itself forever [note that a(3000) has more than 300 digits].

%e A316764 The odd digit 3 multiplies 3 by three (which is 9), and 9 plus 1 is 10;
%e A316764 the odd digit 1 multiplies 10 by three (which is 30), and 30 plus 1 is 31;
%e A316764 the even digit 0 divides 31 by two (which is 15,5), and |15,5| is 15;
%e A316764 the odd digit 3 multiplies 15 by three (which is 45), and 45plus 1 is 46;
%e A316764 the odd digit 1 multiplies 46 by three (which is 138), and 138 plus 1 is 139; etc.
%Y A316764 Cf. A006370 (The Collatz or 3x+1 map: a(n) = n/2 if n is even, 3n + 1 if n is odd).
