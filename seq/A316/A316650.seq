%N A316650 Result when n is divided by the sum of its digits and the resulting integer is concatenated to the remainder.
%C A316650 When the remainder is zero, this 0 is still concatenated to the result (12/3 becomes 40).
%C A316650 All terms of A052224 are fixed points; more generally, if n has digital sum 10^k for some k > 0 and the remainder of n when divided by 10^k has k decimal digits, then n is a fixed point (corrected by _Rémy Sigrist_, Jul 10 2018).

%e A316650 1 divided by 1 is 1 with the remainder 0, thus a(1) = 10;
%e A316650 2 divided by 2 is 1 with the remainder 0, thus a(2) = 10;
%e A316650 3 divided by 3 is 1 with the remainder 0, thus a(3) = 10;
%e A316650 4 divided by 4 is 1 with the remainder 0, thus a(4) = 10;
%e A316650 ...
%e A316650 10 divided by (1+0) is 10 with the remainder 0, thus a(10) = 100;
%e A316650 11 divided by (1+1) is 5 with the remainder 1, thus a(11) = 51;
%e A316650 12 divided by (1+2) is 4 with the remainder 0, thus a(12) = 40;
%e A316650 13 divided by (1+3) is 3 with the remainder 1, thus a(13) = 31;
%e A316650 ...
%e A316650 2018 divided by (2+0+1+8) is 183 with the remainder 5, thus a(2018) = 1835.
