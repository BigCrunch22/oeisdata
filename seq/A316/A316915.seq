%e A316915 Here are the first terms of the sequence:
%e A316915 10,100,11,13,14,16,18,20,12,23,26,29,32,...
%e A316915 and here are the cumulative sums:

%e A316915 If we align a(n) and its cumulative sum, we see that at least two digits are shared:
%e A316915   10,100, 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 20, 12, 23, 26, 29, 32,...

%Y A316915 Cf. A316914 (where one digit is shared instead of two, by the cumulative sum).
