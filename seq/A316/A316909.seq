%N A316909 A self-"read and extend" sequence built following the three rules visible in the Comments section (a variation of A316765).
%C A316909 Start with a(1) = 1 and read the sequence digit by digit starting from the left:
%C A316909 when the read digit is odd, we divide by 3 the last term of the sequence, then extend the sequence with the entire part of the result;
%C A316909 when the read digit is even (but not 0), we multiply by 7 the last term of the sequence, then extend the sequence with the result;
%C A316909 when the read digit is 0, we extend the sequence with the smallest integer not yet present in the sequence.
%C A316909 This is a possible variation among many others of the first 2 rules illustrated by A316765 (where an odd digit divides by 3 and an even digit -except 0â€” multiplies by 2) that shows the flexibility of the "read-and-extend" idea.

%e A316909 Reading the sequence one digit after the other, starting from the left:
%e A316909 the odd digit 1 divides 1 by three (which is 0,333...), and |0,333...| is 0;
%e A316909 the digit 0 extends the sequence with the smallest integer not present yet in the sequence, which is 2;
%e A316909 the digit 2 multiplies 2 by seven, which is 14;
%e A316909 the odd digit 1 divides 14 by three, (which is 4,666...) and |4,666...| is 4;
%e A316909 the digit 4 multiplies 4 by seven, which is 28;
%e A316909 the digit 4 multiplies 28 by seven, which is 196;
%e A316909 etc.
