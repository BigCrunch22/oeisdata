%N A316532 Leading least prime signatures, ordered by the underlying partitions, as in A063008.
%C A316532 The sequence A063008 gives the least number with each prime signature, ordered by the underlying partition. This sequence is a subsequence which only includes those prime signatures M for which M/2 is not a prime signature, the so-called 'leading' least prime signatures.
%C A316532 This sequence is therefore constructed by taking the partitions first in increasing order of their sum, then in decreasing order of the first term, then decreasing order of the second term, etc. We drop all partitions, except the empty partition, where the first term and the second term are different. Then we map (m1, m2, m3, ..., mk) to 2^m1 * 3^m2 * ... * pk^mk to give the terms of this sequence.
%C A316532 The sequence A062515 had a description which suggested that it had been confused with this sequence. They are the same leading least prime signatures, but in a different order, given by a different construction using integer partitions.
%e A316532 The first few partitions are [], [1,1], [1,1,1], [2,2], [1,1,1,1]. So the first few terms are 1, 2 * 3 = 6, 2 * 3 * 5 = 30, 2^2 * 3^2 = 36, 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 = 210.
