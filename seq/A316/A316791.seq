%N A316791 a(n) is the least prime p such that the second forward difference of three consecutive primes p, q and r is n = (p - 2q + r)/2.
%C A316791 Inspired by A295973.
%C A316791 Except for the first three primes {2, 3, 5}, all sfds are even.
%C A316791 The only other sfd which is not covered by this sequence is when the primes are {2, 3, 5} which results in an sfd of 1.
%C A316791 Except for an sfd of 0 or 1, all values of sfd occur infinitely often.
%C A316791 As an example, sfd=2 for p = 5, 11, 17, 19, 41, 43, 79, 83, 101, 107, 127, 163, ..., .

%e A316791 a(0) = 3 since the three consecutive primes {3, 5, 7} have an sfd of 0;
%e A316791 a(1) = 5 since the three consecutive primes {5, 7, 11} have an sfd of 2;
%e A316791 a(2) = 29 since the three consecutive primes {29, 31, 37} have an sfd of 4;
%e A316791 a(3) = 503 since the three consecutive primes {503, 509, 521} have an sfd of 6;
%e A316791 a(4) = 137 since the three consecutive primes {137, 139, 149} have an sfd of 8; etc.
