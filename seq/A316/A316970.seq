%N A316970 Reducible binary polynomials P of degree n>0 with P dividing the polynomial X^(2^n-1)+1, evaluated at X=2 (pseudo-primes in the ring GF(2)[X]).
%C A316970 If a binary polynomial P of degree n is irreducible, then demonstrably P divides the polynomial X^(2^n-1)+1.
%C A316970 All irreducible polynomials A014580 pass this test, requiring O(n^3) bit operations and O(n) bits with classical algorithms.
%C A316970 Polynomials which pass this test but are not irreducible form the sequence.
%C A316970 Analog for GF(2)[X] of Fermat pseudoprimes A001567.
%C A316970 When P includes the constant term 1 (as all primitive polynomials do), the test is equivalent to X^(2^n)=X(mod P), which is easier to compute.

%e A316970 83, that is 1010011 in binary, represents the polynomial P(X)=X^6+X^4+X+1 of degree n=6. It is in the sequence because X^63+1 == 0 (mod P), and P is reducible since P(X)=(X+1)(X^2+X+1)(X^3+X+1) in GF(2)[X].
