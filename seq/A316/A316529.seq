%N A316529 Heinz numbers of totally strong integer partitions.
%C A316529 First differs from A304678 at a(115) = 151, A304678(115) = 150.
%C A316529 The alternating version first differs from this sequence in having 150 and lacking 450.
%C A316529 An integer partition is totally strong if either it is empty, equal to (1), or its run-lengths are weakly decreasing (strong) and are themselves a totally strong partition.
%C A316529 The Heinz number of an integer partition (y_1,...,y_k) is prime(y_1)*...*prime(y_k). This gives a bijective correspondence between positive integers and integer partitions.
%e A316529 Starting with (3,3,2,1), which has Heinz number 150, and repeatedly taking run-lengths gives (3,3,2,1) -> (2,1,1) -> (1,2), so 150 is not in the sequence.
%e A316529 Starting with (3,3,2,2,1), which has Heinz number 450, and repeatedly taking run-lengths gives (3,3,2,2,1) -> (2,2,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1) -> (2) -> (1), so 450 is in the sequence.
