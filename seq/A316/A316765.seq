%N A316765 A self-"read and extend" sequence built following the three rules given in the Comments section.
%C A316765 Start with a(1) = 1 and read the sequence digit by digit starting from the left:
%C A316765 when the read digit is odd, we divide by 2 the last term of the sequence, then extend the sequence with the entire part of the result;
%C A316765 when the read digit is even (but not 0), we multiply by 3 the last term of the sequence, then extend the sequence with the result;
%C A316765 when the read digit is 0, we extend the sequence with the smallest integer not yet present in the sequence.

%e A316765 The odd digit 1 divides 1 by two (which is 0,5), and |0,5| is 0;
%e A316765 the digit 0 extends the sequence with the smallest integer not present yet in the sequence, which is 2;
%e A316765 the digit 2 multiplies 2 by three, which is 6;
%e A316765 the digit 6 multiplies 6 by three, which is 18;
%e A316765 the odd digit 1 divides 18 by two, which is 9;
%e A316765 the digit 8 multiplies 9 by three, which is 27; etc.
