%N A316917 Let g(n) be the n-th maximal prime gap. a(n) = 1 if g(n) has record merit, 0 if it does not.
%C A316917 a(n) = 1 if A002386(n) is in A111870, a(n) = 0 if A002386(n) is not in A111870.
%C A316917 A probable maximal gap of 1552 and merit 34.98 has been discovered (highly likely to be maximal). If it is verified as a maximal gap, we would have a(81) = 0. - _Rodolfo Ruiz-Huidobro_, Jun 22 2021

%e A316917 The 5th record prime gap from 89 to 97 does not have record merit, so a(5) = 0.
%e A316917 The 10th record prime gap from 1327 to 1361 has record merit, so a(10) = 1.
