%N A316917 Let g(n) be the n-th maximal prime gap. a(n) = 1 if g(n) has record merit, 0 if it does not.
%C A316917 a(n) = 1 if A002386(n) is in A111870, a(n) = 0 if A002386(n) is not in A11187
%C A316917 The merit M of a prime gap of measure g following the prime p_1 is defined as M=g/ln(p_1). It is the ratio of the measure of the gap to the "average" measure of gaps near that point .  As an example, the merit of  the sixth maximal gap, of size 14, after prime 113 is 2.96

%e A316917 The 5th record prime gap from 89 to 97 does not have record merit, so a(5) = 0.
%e A316917 The 10th record prime gap from 1327 to 1361 has record merit, so a(10) = 1.
%e A316917 a(81) = 0 because there are previous maximal gaps with higher merits. - _Rodolfo Ruiz-Huidobro_, Jan 23 2024
