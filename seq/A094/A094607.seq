%N A094607 Rectangular array T by antidiagonals: row n consists of the positive integers k for which there are exactly n sets of Fibonacci numbers whose sum is k.
%C A094607 Row n gives the ranks of n in A000119 after the initial 1 is deleted. Every positive integer occurs exactly once in T; thus a is a permutation of the positive integers. Row 1 is A000071 except for initial terms. Column 1 is A013583.
%e A094607 A northwest corner of T:
%e A094607 1 2 4 7 12
%e A094607 3 5 6 9 10
%e A094607 8 11 13 14 18
%e A094607 16 21 26 27 32
%e A094607 6 is in row 2 because there are exactly 2 sets of Fibonacci
%e A094607 numbers whose sum is 6. They are {1,5} and {1,2,3}.
%Y A094607 Cf. A000045, A000119, A094608.
