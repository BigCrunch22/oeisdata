%N A094672 Values of n such that one or more ending terms of the lexicographically earliest squarefree ternary word (LMSFTW) of length n differ(s) from the first n terms of the LMSFTW of length n+1.
%e A094672 The LMSFTW of length 7 is W1=(0,1,0,2,0,1,0) and the LMSFTW of length 8 is W2=
%e A094672 (0,1,0,2,0,1,2,0). Since the last term of W1 differs from the 7th term of W8, 7 is a term of the sequence.
