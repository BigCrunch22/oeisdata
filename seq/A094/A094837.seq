%N A094837 Maximal number of longest common subsequences between any two binary strings of length n (Version 1).
%C A094837 Definitions: S is a subsequence of X if S can be obtained by deleting some (not necessarily adjacent) entries of X.
%C A094837 S is a longest common subsequence of X and Y if S is a subsequence of X, S is a subsequence of Y and for any T, if T is a subsequence of X and of Y, then |T| <= |S|. Let LCS(X,Y) = length of any longest common subsequence of X and Y.
%C A094837 For each longest common subsequence S of X and Y, there may be several ways to delete entries from X and from Y to get S: let F(X,Y) be the total number of ways. Sequence gives max F(X,Y) over all choices for binary strings X and Y of length n.
%C A094837 It appears that using a larger alphabet than binary does not increase the answers: is this true?
%C A094837 A lower bound can be obtained as follows. For n>=4, let k=ceiling(n/4), let X=a^(n-k) b^k, Y=a^k b^(n-k), S=a^k b^k. There are binomial(n-k,k)^2 choices for S, so this (A171001) is a lower bound on a(n). A171002, A171006 and A171003 give successively more refined lower bounds. - _John P. Linderman_, Aug 31 2010
%C A094837 Assuming that all optimal pairs (A,B) are in fact of the form described above, it would appear that a better lower bound could be reached using k = round(n/(2+phi)). In the event that such k is closer to a half-integer, X=a^(n-floor(n/(2+phi))) b^floor(n/(2+phi)), Y=a^ceiling(n/(2+phi)) b^(n-ceiling(n/(2+phi))) tends to be stronger. - _Charlie Neder_, Sep 06 2018
