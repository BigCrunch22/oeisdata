%N A094739 Numbers m such that 4^k*m, for integer k >= 0, are numbers having a unique partition into three squares.
%C A094739 Lehmer's paper has an erroneous version of this sequence. He omits 163 and includes 162 (which has 4 partitions) and 182 (which has 3 partitions). Lehmer conjectures that there are no more terms. Note that squares are allowed to be zero.
%C A094739 From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Aug 27 2020: (Start)
%C A094739 Another name is: Integers not divisible by 4 that are uniquely represented as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 with integers 0 <= x <= y <= z.
%C A094739 This sequence of 33 numbers is complete. See Arno, Theorem 8, p. 332, where 19 is missing, as observed by Kaplansky, Remark 2.1. (a) - (c), p. 87.
%C A094739 All positive integers represented uniquely as sum of three squares of nonnegative numbers, ignoring order and signs, are given by 4^k*a(n), for integer k >= 0 and n = 1 .. 33. See Arno, also p. 322, with some known results, and Kaplansky's Remark 2.1.(c). (End)
