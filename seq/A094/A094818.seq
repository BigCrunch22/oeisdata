%N A094818 Number of classes of dp-homogeneous spherical curves with n double points.
%C A094818 A spherical curve C is said to be dp-homogeneous if the stability group of C in the group of diffeomorphisms of the sphere acts transitively on the set of double points of C. Two spherical curves belongs to the same class if there is a diffeomorphism of the sphere sending the first curve onto the second one.

%e A094818 The second term of the sequence means that all double point-homogeneous spherical curves with just one double point belong to the same orbit relatively to the group of diffeomorphisms of the sphere (it is not true for plane curves: a lemniscate of Bernoulli is not equivalent with a Pascal's lima√ßon). - _Guy Valette_, Feb 21 2017
