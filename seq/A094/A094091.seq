%N A094091 a(1) = 0; for n>0, a(n) = smaller of 0 and 1 such that we avoid the property that, for some i and j in the range S = 2 <= i < j <= n/2, a(i) ... a(2i) is a subsequence of a(j) ... a(2j).
%C A094091 A greedy version of A093383 and A093384.
%C A094091 This is a finite sequence of length 23 (necessarily <= A093382(2) = 31).
%C A094091 For S >= 1 define a sequence by a(1) = 0; for n>0, a(n) = smaller of 0 and 1 such that we avoid the property that, for some i and j in the range S <= i < j <= n/2, a(i) ... a(2i) is a subsequence of a(j) ... a(2j). The present sequence is the case S=2. For S=1 we get a sequence of length 3, namely 0,0,0, and A096094, A106197 are the cases S=3 and S=4. A093382(S) gives an upper bound on their lengths.

%e A094091 After a(1) = a(2) = a(3) = a(4) = 0 we must have a(5) = 1, or else we would have a(2)a(3)a(4) = 000 as a subsequence of a(3)a(4)a(5)a(6) = 000a(6).
