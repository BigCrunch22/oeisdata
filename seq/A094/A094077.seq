%N A094077 a(1)=1 and, for n>1, a(n)=a(n-1)+n if n is even and a(n)=smallest positive integer which has not yet appeared in the sequence if n is odd.
%C A094077 A001951 and A001952 are the bisections of this sequence. - _Klaus Brockhaus_ and _Henry Bottomley_, Feb 04 2006. This implies the asymptotic result stated in the formula line.
%F A094077 For even n, the ratio a(n)/a(n-1) is asymptotic to 1+sqrt(2) as n becomes large.
