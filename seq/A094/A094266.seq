%N A094266 LQTL Lean Quaternary Temporal Logic: a terse form of temporal logic created by assigning four descriptors such that false, becoming true, true and becoming false are represented and become a linear sequence. In a branching tree two alternative are open, change or no change. The integer sequence above is the count of the row possibilities of the four states over successive iterations.
%C A094266 This is a table read by rows of length 4. Every row is formed from the previous one by the circular Pascal triangle-like rule: a, b, c, d -> d+a, a+b, b+c, c+d. Consider a labeled binary tree such that the root has label 0 and every node labeled k has children labeled k and (k+1) mod 4; the n-th row of this sequence counts nodes on the level n+1 with labels 0, 1, 2, 3, while the n-th row of A099423 counts nodes up to level n. - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Jan 06 2023
