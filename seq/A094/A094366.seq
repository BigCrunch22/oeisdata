%N A094366 a(n) is the number of two-generated numerical semigroups whose Frobenius number is 2n-1.
%C A094366 A numerical semigroup is a set of natural numbers closed under addition. Its Frobenius number is the largest number not in it. In the case of a semigroup generated by two relatively prime numbers a and b, its Frobenius number is ab-a-b, which is always odd.
