%F A094455 Arrange 9 consecutive primes in a 3 X 3 grid wherein IBC, HAD, GFE are the first, second and third rows of horizontal primes. Then sum the rows horizontally, vertically and along the two main diagonals. Total the 8 sums, divide by 8 and if the mean is integral and prime, add to the sequence.
%e A094455 a(1)=41 because 41 is the integral and prime mean of the 8 sums of 9 consecutive primes arranged in a 3 X 3 grid wherein the first prime is 3
