%N A094342 Successive record-setters for tau(n+1)*tau(n-1)/tau(n)^2, where tau(n) is the number of divisors of n.
%C A094342 Most terms are primes. These are numbers with few factors which are sandwiched between numbers with many factors. Terms <379 are same as those of A090481.

%e A094342 tau(16)*tau(18)/tau(17)^2 = 5*6/2^2 = 15/2 and this is larger than for any n < 17, so 17 is in the sequence.
