%N A094086 Babylonian reciprocals - factors needed to turn an ugly number into a power of sixty.
%C A094086 Although the Babylonians did not have zero or a decimal point or even a decimal number system, they could calculate fractions, even square and cube roots quite accurately. "30" could mean either thirty or 30/60 = 1/2 or 30/3600 = 1/120 or other such fractions. It would be as if we expressed decimals without zeros or decimal points - 1/2 = 5, 1/4 = 25, 1/8 = 125, 1/10 = 1, etc.
%F A094086 a(n) = (60^x)/f(z) where f(z) = A051037 and 60^(x - 1) > n > 60^x
%e A094086 a(31) = 160000 because the 31st ugly number, f(31) = 81 and (60^4)/81 = 160000
%Y A094086 Cf. A051037.
