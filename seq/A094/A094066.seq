%N A094066 Blind primes (no i's when written in English).
%C A094066 If a naming system is used in which all numbers beyond 999999 contain the word "million," "billion," "trillion," or some other word containing the string "illion" (in which case such terms as "googol" would be disallowed, so that, e.g., 10^100+267 would be "ten duotrigintillion two hundred sixty-seven" under some naming systems), then the sequence is finite, ending with a(3028)=777743. - _Jon E.
