%N A094500 Least number k such that (n+1)^k / n^k >= 2.
%C A094500 This sequence also describes the minimum number of (n+1)-player games, where each player has an equal chance of winning, that must be played for a given player to have at least a 50% chance of winning at least once. E.g., a(3) = 3 because in a 4-player random game, a given player will have a greater than 50% chance of winning at least once if 3 games are played. - Bryan Jacobs (bryanjj(AT)gmail.com), Apr 28 2006
%C A094500 Also, a(n) denotes a median m of the geometric random variable on the positive integers with mean value n+1. The median is obtained by solving 1-(n/n+1)^m >= 1/2 for least integer m. - _Dennis P. Walsh_, Aug 13 2012
%C A094500 The limit n -> inf. a(n)/n = log 2. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, May 13 2014
