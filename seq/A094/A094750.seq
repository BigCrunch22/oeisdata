%N A094750 Rearrangement of composite numbers so that the successive differences are distinct prime numbers. Priority is given to the least successive difference (prime) that has not occurred earlier.
%C A094750 First priority is given to minimize the absolute value |a(n+1)-a(n)| of the difference (a prime), second priority to minimize a(n+1). The term "rearrangement" is conjectural as it remains to be proved that all positive composite numbers A002808 are in the list. - _R. J. Mathar_, Aug 03 2007
