%N A277687 a(n) is the number of nonisomorphic trees on n vertices whose chromatic symmetric function in the p basis has a nonzero coefficient for each possible term.
%C A277687 The path graph is always included in this count.
%C A277687 The chromatic symmetric function is defined in Stanley (1995). By theorem 2.5 of that reference we can give an equivalent definition of this sequence. Say that a forest corresponds to the partition whose parts are the sizes of the trees in the forest. Then a(n) counts the trees on n vertices for which a forest corresponding to any partition of n can be produced by deleting edges from the tree. - _Peter J. Taylor_, Sep 03 2021

%e A277687 For n = 5 there are three trees, but a(5) = 2 because the star tree cannot be split into a tree of size 2 and a tree of size 3. - _Peter J. Taylor_, Sep 03 2021
