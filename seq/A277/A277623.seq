%N A277623 Each odd term "t" of the sequence is followed by t even terms and each odd digit "k" of the sequence is followed by k even digits.
%C A277623 After a(1) = 1, the sequence is always extended with the smallest integer not yet present which does not lead to a contradiction.
%C A277623 In a private mail to Eric Angelini, Lars Blomberg wrote about the b-file: "Only the odd terms 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 101, 103, 21, 201 and 2000001 [are in the b-file];  so the sequence will continue with 2000001 even numbers and odd one."
%C A277623 The sequence could be started with the even term a(0) = 0, which would not impose any restriction and thus be followed by the next smallest possible integer, a(1) = 1. The sequence is not a permutation of the positive integers because some numbers (11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 31, ..., 97, 99, 100, 102,..., 110, 111, ..., 119, 130, ...) = A277694 can never occur. (The odd digit 1 must be followed by 1 even digit, etc.) The previous comment shows why odd terms occur late, but probably (I conjecture) any odd term which is not excluded a priori will occur sooner or later. - _M.
