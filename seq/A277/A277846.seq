%N A277846 The digits of the absolute difference |a(n+1)-a(n)| are a sub(multi)set of the digits of a(n): Lexicographically first sequence with this property and without negative or repeated terms.
%C A277846 In contrast to A277845, the order of the digits does not matter: for example, if a(n) = 123, the difference with the next term might be 21, 31, or 32, which is not possible in A277845 or in A277858.
%C A277846 This sequence differs from A277858 and A277845 from a(63) = 71 + 17 = 88 on, while A277858(63) = A277845(63) = 71 + 71 = 142. In contrast to A277858 and A277845 in which the 12 numbers {3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 33, 46, 61} do not appear, the number 46 = a(78) is in this sequence, and only the other 11 numbers are missing here.
%C A277846 It is easy to prove that this is not a permutation of the positive integers: for example, the number 5 cannot occur anywhere later in the sequence, since it has no possible successor (10 being already used). Relaxing the defining condition to "each digit of |a(n+1)-a(n)| is a digit of a(n)" (e.g., a step of 11 would be allowed after 123), leads to the variant A276070 which is a permutation.
