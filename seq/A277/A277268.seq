%N A277268 If we call "T" this sequence and consider the k-digit term a(n) of T with digits abcd...k, then a(n+1) = [a(n) + the a-th digit of T + the b-th digit of T + the c-th digit of T + ... + the k-th digit of T].  This is the lexicographically first such infinite sequence containing no duplicate term.
%C A277268 There are 3 lexicographically earlier sequences with this property, but they all stop at some point. The first one is A276514, starting with 5,10,15,25,31,... and halting with a(49) = 300. The second one starts with 9,10,19,29,31,... and stops with a(246) = 3003. The third one starts with 10,11,13,15,17,... and ends with a(8) = 22, as shown here: 10, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22. [To compute a hypothetical a(9), one has to add to 22 the second digit of the sequence (which is zero) and (again) the second digit of the sequence (again zero): 22+0+0 = 22.]
%C A277268 As this sequence, starting with 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, ..., shows no zero digit among its first 10 digits, it will never stop.

%e A277268 To compute a(2), add to a(1) the 1st digit of T and the 1st digit of T, so a(2) = 11+1+1 = 13;
%e A277268 to compute a(3), add to a(2) the 1st digit of T and the 3rd digit of T, so a(3) = 13+1+1 = 15;
%e A277268 to compute a(4), add to a(3) the 1st digit of T and the 5th digit of T, so a(4) = 15+1+1 = 17;
%e A277268 to compute a(5), add to a(4) the 1st digit of T and the 7th digit of T, so a(5) = 17+1+1 = 19;
%e A277268 to compute a(6), add to a(5) the 1st digit of T and the 9th digit of T, so a(6) = 19+1+1 = 21;
%e A277268 to compute a(7), add to a(6) the 2nd digit of T and the 1st digit of T, so a(7) = 19+1+1 = 23;
