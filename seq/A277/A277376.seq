%N A277376 Each prime p is followed by p nonprimes.
%C A277376 The sequence starts with a(1) = 2 and was always extended with the smallest integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction.

%e A277376 As a(1) = 2, we take for a(2) and a(3) the nonprimes "1" and "4"; we then extend the sequence with a(4) which must be the smallest prime not yet present: this is "3"; we take for a(5), a(6) and a(7) the 3 smallest nonprimes not yet present: they are 6, 8 and 9; we then extend the sequence with the smallest prime available, which is a(8) = 5.
