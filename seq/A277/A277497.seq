%N A277497 Number of cryptarithms of the form x + y = z in base n for which no summand contains any letter more than once and which have at least one solution.
%C A277497 Two cryptarithms are the same if one may be obtained from the other by a process of replacing letters and swapping the summands. For instance, the problem AB + BCD = DDD is the same as ABC + DA = CCC.
%C A277497 Solutions must assign a different digit to each letter, and numbers may not begin with 0.

%e A277497 In base 10, the classic SEND + MORE = MONEY has an assignment of digits to the letters that makes the equation true, and is counted because neither SEND nor MORE contains a given letter more than once.
%e A277497 In base 3, CBA + AB = CAA is solvable, and is counted. There are exactly two solutions: (A = 1, B = 0, C = 2) and (A = 2, B = 0, C = 1).
