%N A277801 a(n) = 2^(n - 1) - prime(n).
%C A277801 Obviously all terms are odd. Only the first three terms are negative.
%C A277801 The law of small numbers says there are not enough small numbers for all the demands placed on them.
%C A277801 I think one of those demands is that there be a strong correlation between the powers of 2 and the prime numbers. The first four primes and the first four powers of 2 deliver. But then the powers of 2 rise, literally, exponentially, leaving the primes behind in the dust.
%F A277801 a(n) is approximately 2^(n - 1).
