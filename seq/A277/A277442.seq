%e A277442 a(2) = 101 as 101 is the least number that can be modified in two different ways in order to become its square; i.e., 101^2 equals 10201, which can be represented as 1(02)01 or 10(20)1.
%e A277442 a(5) = 950005 because 950005^2 = 902509500025 can be represented in 5 ways: 9(02)5(095)000(2)5, 9(02)50(95)0(0)0(2)5, 9(02)50(95)00(02)5, 9(02)50(950)00(2)5, 9(02509)5000(2)5.
