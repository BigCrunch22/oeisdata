%N A277121 Numbers that immediately halt Conway's FIBONACCIGAME.
%C A277121 Like PRIMEGAME, Conway's FIBONACCIGAME uses a list of fractions to come up with a sequence expressed as exponents of powers of 2, the sequence in this case being the Fibonacci numbers (A000045, see A000301).
%C A277121 Unlike PRIMEGAME, FIBONACCIGAME does not have any integers in its list of rational numbers, which means that the process always comes to a halt, sooner or later, depending on the initial value.
%C A277121 Hence this sequence includes all powers of 2 (A000079). Also all primes greater than 43.
%C A277121 However, this sequence includes no multiples of 13 (as they can be handled by 17/65 or 1/13), nor any multiples of 3 (as they're taken care of by 1/3).
%C A277121 Indeed the sequence contains no multiples of 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37 either.
