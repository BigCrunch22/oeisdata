%N A277450 a(1) = 1, a(n) = floor(n*Sum_{k=1..n-1} a(k)/2^k - Sum_{k=1..n-1} a(k)) for n > 1.
%C A277450 The mean density of ones in the sequence converges to a limit C, and the binary expansion of C is the sequence itself.
%C A277450 Let s(n) = Sum_{k=1..n} a(k), c(n) = Sum_{k=1..n} a(k)/2^k, and d(n) = s(n)/n.
%C A277450 By definition, s(n) = floor(n*c(n-1)) for n > 1.
%C A277450 We can show by induction that a(n) always equals 0 or 1.
%C A277450 Hence, c(n) converges to some limit C as n goes to infinity.
%C A277450 Also, d(n) = floor(n*c(n-1))/n ~ floor(n*C)/n ~ C as n goes to infinity (QED).
%C A277450 C = 0.58870955436366549427...
%C A277450 This constant C cannot be rational: the mean density of ones in the binary representation of a rational number u/v (with 0 < u < v and gcd(u,v) = 1) can be written as u'/v' with 0 < u' < v' and v' = A007733(v); as v' <= phi(v) < v, u/v never equals u'/v'.
%C A277450 Let b be the eventually periodic sequence with pre-period b(1)..b(14) = a(1)..a(14), and period 124 given by a(15)..a(138). The mean density of ones in b is the rational number 73/124 = 0.58870967... Of course, a and b cannot be equal, but a(n) = b(n) for all n < 65614. - _Michel Dekking_, Mar 30 2017
