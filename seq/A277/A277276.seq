%N A277276 Number of tautologies and contradictions in propositional calculus of length n.
%C A277276 a(n) is the number of tautologies and contradictions that are n symbols long in propositional calculus with the connectives not (~), and (*), or (+), implies (->) and if and only if (<->).
%C A277276 When measuring the length of a formula all brackets must be included. The connectives -> and <-> are counted as one symbol each (but writing them as such requires non-ASCII characters).
%C A277276 Formally, the language used for this sequence contains the symbols a-z and A-Z (the variables), ~, *, +, ->, <->, ( and ).
%C A277276 The formulas are defined by the following rules:
%C A277276 - every variable is a formula;
%C A277276 - if A is a formula, then ~A is a formula;
%C A277276 - if A and B are formulas, then (A*B), (A+B), (A->B) and (A<->B) are all formulas.
%C A277276 A formula is a tautology if it is true for any assignment of truth values to the variables.
%C A277276 A formula is a contradiction if it is false for any assignment of truth values to the variables.
%C A277276 This sequence is increasing, as adding a ~ to the start of a tautology or contradiction gives a contradiction or tautology one symbol longer.

%e A277276 The contradictions of length 6 are ~(a<->a), ~(a->a), (~a*a), (~a<->a), (a*~a) and (a<->~a): 6 formulas, and the tautologies of length 6 are (~a+a) and (a+~a): 2 formulas. So a(6) = 6+2 = 8.
