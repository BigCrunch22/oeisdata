%N A277608 Least number of fractions of the form (k+1)/k, for k a positive integer, whose product equals n.
%C A277608 If each intermediate product of the first j of the fractions, for all j < a(n), is also restricted to be an integer, the resulting sequence is A117497.  The first n for which a shorter product can be obtained by allowing intermediate non-integer products is 43 = 2/1 * 2/1 * 2/1 * 2/1 * 2/1 * 4/3 * 129/128, a product of 7 fractions, where A117497(43) = 8.
