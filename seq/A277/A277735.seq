%C A277735 From _Clark Kimberling_, May 21 2017: (Start)
%C A277735 Let u be the sequence of positions of 0, and likewise, v for 1 and w for 2.  Let U, V, W be the limits of u(n)/n, v(n)/n, w(n)/n, respectively.  Then 1/U + 1/V + 1/W = 1, where
%C A277735 U = 1.8392867552141611325518525646532866...,
%C A277735 V = U^2 = 3.3829757679062374941227085364...,
%C A277735 W = U^3 = 6.2222625231203986266745611011....
%C A277735 If n >=2, then u(n) - u(n-1) is in {1,2,3}, v(n) - v(n-1) is in {2,4,5}, and w(n) - w(n-1) is in {4,7,9}. (u = A277736, v = A277737, w = A277738). (End)
%C A277735 Although I believe the assertions in Kimberling's comment above to be correct, these results are quite tricky to prove, and unless a formal proof is supplied at present these assertions must be regarded as conjectures. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 20 2018
%C A277735 From _Michel Dekking_, Oct 03 2019: (Start)
%C A277735 Here is a proof of Clark Kimberling's conjectures (and more).
%C A277735 The incidence matrix of the defining morphism
%C A277735     sigma:  0 -> 01, 1 -> 20, 2 -> 0
%C A277735 is  the same as the incidence matrix of the tribonacci morphism
%C A277735             0 -> 01, 1 -> 02, 2 -> 0
%C A277735 (see A080843  and/or A092782).
%C A277735 This implies that the frequencies  f0, f1 and f2 of the letters 0,1, and 2 in (a(n)) are the same as the corresponding frequencies in the tribonacci word, which are 1/t, 1/t^2  and 1/t^3 (see, e.g., A092782).
%C A277735 Since   U = 1/f0,  V = 1/f1, and W = 1/f2, we conclude that
%C A277735     U = t = A058265,  V = t^2 = A276800 and W = t^3 = A276801.
%C A277735 The statements on the difference sequences u, v, and w of the positions of 0,1, and 2 are easily verified by applying sigma to the return words of  these three letters.
%C A277735 Here the return words of an arbitrary word w in a sequence x are all the words occurring in x with prefix w that do not have other occurrences of w in them.
%C A277735 The return words of 0 are 0, 01, and 012, which indeed have length 1, 2
%C A277735 and 3. Since
%C A277735     sigma(0) = 01, sigma(1) = 0120, and sigma(012) = 01200,
%C A277735 one sees that u is the unique fixed point of the morphism
%C A277735     1 -> 2, 2-> 31, 3 ->311.
%C A277735 With a little more work, passing to sigma^2, and rotating, one can show that v is the unique fixed point of the morphism
%C A277735     2->52, 4->5224, 5->52244 .
%C A277735 Similarly, w is the unique fixed point of the morphism
%C A277735     4->94, 7->9447, 9->94477.
%C A277735 Interestingly, the three morphisms having u,v, and w as fixed point are essentially the same morphism (were we replaced sigma by sigma^2) with standard form
%C A277735     1->12, 2->1223, 3->12233.
%C A277735 (End)
%C A277735 The kind of phenomenon observed at the end of the previous comment holds in a very strong way for the tribonacci word. See Theorem 5.1. in the paper by Huang and Wen. - _Michel Dekking_, Oct 04 2019
