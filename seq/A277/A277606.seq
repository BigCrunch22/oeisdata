%C A277606 From _David A. Corneth_, Jan 02 2018: (Start)
%C A277606 For every positive integer n, we can create a tuple b of t increasing positive integers with b_1 = n, the product of these elements a perfect square and the largest element as small as possible.
%C A277606 A006255 lists b_t, the largest element of these tuples, A245499 lists these tuples and this sequence lists the frequency of n occurring in such a tuple, i.e., the frequency of n in A245499. (End)
%C A277606 Records occur for n = 1, 3, 6, 8, 18, 32, 72, 200, ... where a(n) is 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13, 19, ... respectively.
%H A277606 David A. Corneth, <a href="/A277606/b277606.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..10000</a>
%e A277606 8 occurs in rows 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 being respectively [3, 6, 8], [5, 8, 10], [6, 8, 12], [7, 8, 14] and [8, 10, 12, 15]. These are 5 rows so a(8) = 5.
