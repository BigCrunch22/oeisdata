%N A277155 Lexicographically least sequence of nonnegative integers that avoids 11/7-powers.
%C A277155 This sequence is 27-regular.
%C A277155 More generally, if a/b is a rational number in the interval 3/2 < a/b < 5/3 with gcd(b, 5) = 1 and gcd(a, b) = 1, then the lexicographically least sequence of nonnegative integers that avoids a/b-powers is (5 a - 4 b)-regular.
