%N A277496 Number of cryptarithms of the form x + y = z in base n for which no summand contains any letter more than once and for which the solution is unique.
%C A277496 Two cryptarithms are the same if one may be obtained from the other by a process of replacing letters and/or swapping the summands. For instance, the problem AB + BCD = DDD is the same as ABC + DA = CCC.
%C A277496 Solutions must assign a different digit to each letter, and numbers may not begin with 0.

%e A277496 In base 10, the classic SEND + MORE = MONEY has a unique assignment of digits to the letters that makes the equation true, and is counted because neither SEND nor MORE contains a given letter more than once.
%e A277496 In base 3, CBA + CAB = AAA has a unique solution (A = 2, B = 0, C = 1), and so is counted.
