%N A277650 Numbers with primitive English number names.
%C A277650 A "primitive English number name" is defined here as an English number name whose letters do not fully spell any other English number name.
%C A277650 English number names for all numbers not in this sequence consist of letters that spell at least one of these words: zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirty, forty, fifty. If "zero" is removed from this list, the statement is still true. Any further removals depend upon whether names such as the British "milliard" are permitted; e.g., "eleven milliard" requires "eleven" to stay in the list (lack of a second "n" does not permit "nine" here).
%e A277650 The number 13 is not a term because "three" or "ten" can be spelled using the letters in "thirteen". On the other hand, 50 is a term because the letters in "fifty" cannot be used to form any other English number name.
%Y A277650 Cf. A005589 (see many English number names).
