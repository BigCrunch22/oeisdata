%N A277017 Number of maximal runs of 1-bits (in binary expansion of n) such that the length of run >= A000040(1 + the total number of zeros to the right of that run).
%C A277017 a(n) = number of 1-runs in binary expansion of n that exceed the length allotted to that run by primorial base coding used in A277022. If a(n) = 0, then n is in the range of A277022.

%F A277017 a(n) = A129251(A005940(1+n)).
%e A277017 For n=3, "11" in binary, the only maximal run of 1-bits is of length 2, and 2 >= prime(0+1) (where 0 is the total number of zeros to the right of it), thus a(3) = 1.
%e A277017 For n=59, "111011" in binary, both the length of run "11" at the least significant end exceeds the limit (see case n=3 above), and also the length of run "111" >= prime(1 + the total number of 0's to the right of it) = prime(2) = 3, thus a(59) = 1+1 = 2.
%e A277017 For n=60, "111100" in binary, the length of only run of 1's is 4, and 4 < prime(2+1) = 5, thus a(60) = 0.
