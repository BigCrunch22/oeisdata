%N A277383 Each even integer k is followed by k odd integers.
%C A277383 The sequence starts with a(1) = 0 and was always extended with the smallest nonnegative integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction.

%e A277383 As a(1) = 0, a(2) cannot be an odd term: thus a(2) = 2 (the smallest available nonnegative even integer); now as a(3) and a(4) must be odd integers we have a(3) = 1 and a(4) = 3 (again, the smallest available nonnegative odd integers); now a(5) = 4, forcing the next 4 integers to be odd, thus a(6) = 5, a(7) = 7, a(8) = 9 and a(9) = 11; etc.
