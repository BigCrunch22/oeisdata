%N A277007 Number of maximal runs of 1-bits (in binary expansion of n) such that the length of run > 1 + the total number of zeros anywhere right of that run.

%F A277007 a(n) = A276077(A005940(1+n)).
%e A277007 For n=3, "11" in binary, the only maximal run of 1-bits is of length 2, and 2 > 0+1 (where 0 is the total number of zeros to the right of it), thus a(3) = 1.
%e A277007 For n=59, "111011" in binary, both the length of run "11" at the least significant end exceeds the limit (see case n=3 above), and also the length of run "111" exceeds 1 + the total number of 0's to the right of it, thus a(59) = 1+1 = 2.
%e A277007 For n=60, "111100" in binary, the length of only run of 1's is 4, and 4 > 2+1, thus a(60) = 1.
%e A277007 For n=118, "1110110" in binary, the length of rightmost run of 1-bits is 2, but that is not > 1+1 (one more than the number of 0-bits right to it). Also, the length of the leftmost run of 1-bits is 3, but that is not > 1+2, thus a(118) = 0.
%e A277007 For n=246, "11110110" in binary, the rightmost run of 1-bits does not contribute, but the leftmost run of 1-bits has now length 4, which is more than 1+2 (where 2 is the total number of 0-bits right of it), thus a(246) = 1.
