%N A277686 The number of nonisomorphic graphs on n vertices whose chromatic symmetric function in the p basis has a nonzero coefficient for each possible term.
%C A277686 All graphs with a Hamiltonian path are included in this count. The smallest n for which a graph with n vertices satisfies this property and does not have a Hamiltonian path is n=5.
