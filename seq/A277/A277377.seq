%N A277377 Each odd integer k is followed by k even integers.
%C A277377 The sequence starts with a(1) = 1 and was always extended with the smallest nonnegative integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction.
%C A277377 Sequence places odd numbers (2n - 1) at position A002061(n). First even number to appear after this is A001105(n - 1). - _Michael De Vlieger_, Oct 12 2016

%e A277377 As a(1) = 1, we take for a(2) the even integer "0"; we then extend the sequence with a(3) which must be the smallest odd integer not yet present: this is "3"; we take for a(4), a(5) and a(6) the 3 smallest even integers not yet present: they are 2, 4 and 6; we then extend the sequence with the smallest odd available integer, which is a(7) = 5. Etc.
