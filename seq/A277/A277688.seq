%N A277688 Odd numbers k such that there is no prime p < k/2 with k - 2*p and k + 2*p both prime.
%C A277688 Or, odd integers k such that k + 2*p is composite for all primes p, q with 2*p + q = k. By the Lemoine-Levy conjecture, for every odd k>5, there are primes p and q such that k=2*p+q. Numbers 1,3,5 formally satisfy the condition.
%C A277688 The sequence is an analog of A284919 for odd numbers.
%C A277688 Conjecture: k=59 and k=151 are the only terms k>5 satisfying the additional condition that k + 2*q is composite for every prime p,q such that 2*p+q=k.
%C A277688 This conjecture arose from the calculations up to 500001 by _Peter J. C. Moses_ and confirmed by _M. F. Hasler_.
%C A277688 More than half of all odd numbers are in this sequence: for k < 2000, the percentage is below 50%, but for k < 1e4, 2e4 and 4e4 the percentage is > 55%, 56% and 58%, respectively. - _M. F. Hasler_, Apr 11 2017
