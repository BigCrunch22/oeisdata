%N A277133 Number of distinct sets of periods of length >= ceiling(n/2) in all binary strings of length n.
%C A277133 A period of a string x of length n is an integer p such that x[i] = x[i+p] for 1 <= i <= n-p.
%C A277133 From _Jeffrey Shallit_, Jan 17 2019: (Start)
%C A277133 Alternatively, the number of distinct sets of border lengths, restricted to at most n/2 in length, possible over all binary strings of length n.  A border of a word is a nonempty prefix that is also a suffix.
%C A277133 Alternatively, the number of distinct sets of lengths of palindromes that can begin a binary word of length n. (End)
%e A277133 For n = 5, the possible sets of periods of length >=3 are {5}, {3,5}, {4,5}, {3,4,5}, achieved by the strings 00001, 01001, 00010, 00100, respectively.
%Y A277133 Cf. A005434, which is the sequence where there is no restriction on the size of the periods.
