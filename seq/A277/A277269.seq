%N A277269 Hypotenuses of Pythagorean triples, generated by a variation of Euclid's formula.
%C A277269 Take two positive integers, x > y. As shown in the referenced faux art, you can form a vector using the integers as the coordinates, and repeat that vector and its equal-length normal so that you get exactly to the x-axis. Now you can mirror the pattern: take the same number of normal vectors but in the opposite direction. You get an isosceles triangle and the equal sides represent a Pythagorean triple.
%C A277269 Let s = gcd(x,y). This is the scaling factor -- you divide x and y by it and get coprime x and y. The symmetry axis goes from (0,0) to (xx,xy). The first normal goes from (xx,xy) to (xx+yy,0). The second normal goes from (xx,xy) to (xx-yy,xy+xy). So x^2+y^2 is the hypotenuse of the triangle with catheti x^2-y^2 and 2xy. Scale these with s and you get the triple corresponding to the parameters. In the examples the hypotenuse will be called P(x,y).
