%N A277375 Each nonprime integer "n" is followed by n prime integers.
%C A277375 The sequence starts with a(1) = 1 and is always extended with the smallest integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction.
%C A277375 From _Michael De Vlieger_, Oct 12 2016 (Start):
%C A277375 Each nonprime c = A018252(n) followed by c primes starting with prime(A175967(n)).
%C A277375 The position of nonprimes in a(n) is {1, 3, 8, 15, 24, 34, 45, 58, 73, 89, 106, 125, ...}. (End)

%e A277375 As a(1) = 1, we take for a(2) the prime "2"; we then extend the sequence with a(3) which must be the smallest nonprime not yet present: this is "4"; we take for a(4), a(5), a(6) and a(7) the 4 smallest primes not yet present: they are 3, 5, 7 and 11; we then extend the sequence with the smallest nonprime available, which is a(8) = 6. Etc.
