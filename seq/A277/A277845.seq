%N A277845 The digits of the absolute difference |a(n+1)-a(n)| are a subsequence of the digits of a(n): Lexicographically first infinite sequence with this property and without negative or repeated terms.
%C A277845 In contrast to A277858, any one or more digits of a(n) can be omitted. (For example, if a(n) = 123, the absolute difference may be any of { 1, 2, 3, 12, 13, 23, 123 }, while 13 would be forbidden in A277858.)
%C A277845 To ensure the sequence is infinite, one has to check whether a potential successor of a term will have a successor itself. For example, a(80) = 51 would most naively be followed by 51 - 5 = 46, which does not occur earlier, but which then would have no possible successor. Therefore one must choose a(81) = 51 + 51 = 102.
%C A277845 This sequence differs from A277858 from a(88) = 120 on (which follows a(87) = 138 = a(88) + 18), while a gap of 18 is not allowed at this point in A277858, where A277858(88) = 125 = a(87) - 13. Thereafter this sequence continues completely differently from A277858, but they have the same set of 12 numbers {3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 33, 46, 61} which never appear.
%C A277845 It is easy to prove that this is not a permutation of the positive integers: indeed, for example, the number 5 can never occur in the sequel, since it has no possible successor (10 being already used). There are several variants of this sequence, some of which are permutations: Aside the stronger condition defining A277858, one could consider the weaker conditions "digits of |a(n+1)-a(n)| are a sub-multiset of those of a(n)" (e.g., a step of 21 would be allowed after 123), or "... are a subset of ..." (a step of 11 would be allowed after 123). The latter variant (which is a permutation) is A276070.
