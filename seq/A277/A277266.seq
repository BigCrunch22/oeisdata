%N A277266 The number of Fibonacci type sequences which contain n after the initial terms.
%C A277266 We define a "Fibonacci" type sequence to be any two term recursive sequence with a(n) = a(n-2) + a(n-1) with a(0) and a(1) being any two nonnegative integers.
%C A277266 Obviously, if we do not restrict n from being either a(0) or a(1), then there are infinitely many terms for any n.
%C A277266 Even if {x, y} generates n, {y, x} may not generate n. For example, {1, 2} generates 5, but {2, 1} does not generate 5. Similarly, {2, 1} generates 4, but {1, 2} does not generate 4.

%F A277266 It appears that a(n) ~ kn for k near 89/50.
%F A277266 The constant k = 1.773877583285132... = A290565. Proof: Take a number n. For any Fibonacci sequence containing n after the first two terms, the number m immediately before n in the sequence satisfies 0 <= m <= n. The sequences (0, n), (1, n-1), (2, n-2), ..., (n, 0) all contain n as the next term. There are n+1 of these sequences. As n->infinity, the ratio of the number of these sequences to n approaches 1. If n/2 <= m <= n, then the sequence (2m-n, n-m) contains n after 2 terms. There are floor(n/2)+1 of these sequences. As n->infinity, the ratio of the number of these sequences to n approaches 1/2. Similarly, there are approximately n/(Fibonacci(x)*Fibonacci(x+1)) sequences that contain n after x terms. As n->infinity, the ratio of the number of these sequences to n approaches 1/(Fibonacci(x)*Fibonacci(x+1)). Therefore, as n->infinity, the ratio of the number of Fibonacci sequences containing n to n approaches 1 + 1/2 + 1/6 + 1/15 + ... = 1/(1*1) + 1/(1*2) + 1/(2*3) + 1/(3*5) + ... = Sum_{x>=1} 1/(Fibonacci(x)*Fibonacci(x+1)) = 1.773877583285132... - _Bobby Jacobs_, Aug 07 2017
%e A277266 a(0) = 1 since there is only the single sequence with {a(0),a(1)} = {0,0};
