%N A318999 Number of stable nuclides with neutron excess n, i.e., (neutron number) - (proton number) = n.
%C A318999 Radioactive nuclides with a half-life of 700 million years or greater (i.e., half-life longer than or equal to that of uranium-235) are included.
%C A318999 n = -8 represents the most proton-rich nuclide known (nickel-48), n = 61 represents the most neutron-rich nuclides known, although there are many unconfirmed nuclides with neutron excess 62 or 64.
%C A318999 Sum_{n=-8..61} a(n) = 286, which is the number of known stable nuclides.
%C A318999 Note that if a nuclide has Z protons and N neutrons then its mass number is A = Z + N while its neutron excess is D = N - Z, so A == D (mod 2). This means that the total number of stable nuclides with an even neutron excess is 176 (the same as that of stable nuclides with an even mass number), while for odd mass number it's 110.
%C A318999 The only odd k such that a(k) > 5 are a(13) = a(23) = 6, a(5) = 7, a(11) = 9 and a(1) = 16, while there are only 6 even numbers such that a(k) <= 5.
