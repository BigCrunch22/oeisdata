%N A318535 Integers a(n) such that [a(n) - k] is a palindrome in base 10, with k <10.
%C A318535 This is not the sequence A260255 although more than the first 111 terms are equal.

%e A318535 21 is not in the sequence because 11 (the closest palindromic integer < 21) is not reachable by subtracting an integer < 10 from 21. The integers 32, 43 or 2018 are not in the sequence for the same reason.
%Y A318535 Cf. A318536 for an equivalent sequence [addition of (k < 10) instead of subtraction].
%Y A318535 Cf. A261906.
