%N A318632 Let a partition of n be written in binary. Join any two binary ones which are adjacent horizontally or vertically. If all the binary ones are connected count this partition in a(n).

%e A318632 The partition of 7 = 3 + 2 + 2 looks like this in binary:
%e A318632   11
%e A318632   10
%e A318632   10
%e A318632 The binary ones are adjacent so this partition is counted in a(7).
%e A318632 The partition 7 = 5 + 2 looks like this in binary:
%e A318632   101
%e A318632    10
%e A318632 Since the binary ones are not adjacent horizontally or vertically this partition is not counted in a(7).
