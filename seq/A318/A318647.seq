%N A318647 Lexicographically first sequence of distinct nonnegative terms whose succession of digits is the same as in its associated sequence P (see the Comments section for P).
%C A318647 P(n) is the product [last digit of a(n) * first digit of a(n+1)].
%H A318647 Jean-Marc Falcoz, <a href="/A318647/b318647.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..174</a>
%e A318647 The sequence starts with 0,1,11,101,12,51,13,41,501,111,...
%e A318647 Let's make the successive products of [the last digit of a(n) * the first digit of a(n+1)]; we have [0*1] = 0; then [1*1] = 1; then [1*1] = 1; then [1*1] = 1; then [2*5] = 10; then [1*1] = 1; then [3*4] = 12; then [1*5] = 5; then [1*1] = 1; etc.
%e A318647 Those successive products build the sequence P = 0, 1, 1, 1, 10, 1, 12, 5, 1, ... and P shows the same succession of digits as the starting sequence.
%Y A318647 Cf. A318648 for the sum (instead of the product) of the digits "framing a comma" in the sequence.
