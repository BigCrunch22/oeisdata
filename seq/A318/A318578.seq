%N A318578 Let k be the greatest odd divisor of n and let S be the sequence of positive integers not in the sequence so far in increasing order. Then a(n) = S(k).
%C A318578 In other words, a(n) = A000265(n)-th positive integer unused so far.
%C A318578 A permutation of the positive integers.
%C A318578 a(n) = 2n - 1 for odd n, a(n) < 2n - 1 otherwise.

%e A318578 For n=6, the highest odd divisor of n is k = 3. The sequence up to that point is 1, 2, 5, 3, 9. The numbers which are not yet in the sequence (in increasing order) are S = 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, ... and the 3rd of these is 7, which is therefore a(6).
