%N A318243 Triangle read by rows giving the sum of the number of k-matchings of the graphs obtained by deleting one edge and its two vertices from the ladder graph L_n = P_2 X P_n in all possible ways.
%C A318243 T(n,k) is useful for computing the number of configurations of n indistinguishable pairs placed on the vertices of P_2 X P_n such that only one such pair is joined by an edge. The g.f. given below can be proven using the calculus of the rook polynomial associated with A046741.

%e A318243 For n = 2, the four ways of deleting an edge and its vertices from P_2 X P_2 all yield a graph with two vertices joined by an edge. This graph has 1 0-matching and 1 1-matching, thus T(2,k) = 4, 4.
