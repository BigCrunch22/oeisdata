%N A318687 Number of length-n circular binary words having exactly n distinct blocks of length floor(log_2(n)) + 1 (A070939).
%C A318687 A "circular word" (a.k.a. "necklace") is one that wraps around from the end to the beginning.  The words are counted up to an equivalence where two circular words are the same if one is a cyclic shift of the other.
