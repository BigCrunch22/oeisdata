%N A318973 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of permutations of [2n-1] that have exactly one preimage under West's stack-sorting map and that also have first entry k.
%C A318973 Rows are symmetric: T(n,k) = T(n,2n-k).
%C A318973 It appears that the sequence T(n,1),...,T(n,2n-1) is always unimodal. In fact, it appears that this sequence is always log-concave.
%C A318973 Row sums give A180874.

%F A318973 T(n,1) = T(n,2n-1) = 0 for n>1.
%F A318973 T(n,2) = T(n,2n-2) = A180874(n-1) for n>1.
%e A318973 The five uniquely sorted permutations of [5] are 21435, 31425, 32415, 32145, and 42135. Of these permutations, T(3,1) = 0 start with the entry 1, T(3,2) = 1 starts with 2, T(3,3) = 3 start with 3, T(3,4) = 1 starts with 4, and T(3,5) = 0 start with 5.
