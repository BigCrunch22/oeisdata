%N A318988 Totients whose inverses contain two or more consecutive tetrahedral pyramidal numbers.
%C A318988 For a(1) = A000010(A000292(5)) = A000010(A000292(6)) = A000010(A000292(7)), this reduces to A000010(5*7) = A000010(8*7) = A000010(12*7). The number 7 is relatively prime to 5, 8, and 12 which are inverses of the totient value 4.  7 appears in the numerator of A000292(5), A000292(6), and A000292(7). Following the same process 11 and 17 replace 7 for a(2) and a(3).
%C A318988 Conjecture: There are at most three consecutive tetrahedral pyramidal numbers in the set of inverses of a totient number.
%e A318988 24 is a term because A000010(A000292(5)) = A000010(A000292(6)) = A000010(A000292(7)) = 24.
%e A318988 80 is a term because A000010(A000292(9)) = A000010(A000292(10)) = 80.
%e A318988 380160 is a term because A000010(A000292(182)) = A000010(A000292(183)) = A000010(A000292(184)) = 380160.
