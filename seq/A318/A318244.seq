%N A318244 a(n) is the number of configurations of n indistinguishable pairs placed on the vertices of the ladder graph P_2 X P_n such that only one such pair is joined by an edge.
%C A318244 This is a companion entry to A318243 and uses an inclusion-exclusion method on the matching numbers given there.
%C A318244 This is also the number of "1-domino" configurations in the game of memory played on a 2 X n rectangular array, see [Young]. - _Donovan Young_, Oct 23 2018

%F A318244 a(n) = Sum_{k=0..n-1} (-1)^k*(2*n-2*k-3)!! * A318243(n,k) where and 0!! = (-1)!! = 1; proved by inclusion-exclusion.
%e A318244 For the case n = 2, if one pair is joined by an edge, then the remaining pair is forced to be joined by the remaining edge. Thus a(2) = 0.
%Y A318244 Cf. A046741, A318243, A318267, A318268, A318269, A318270. When no pair is joined by an edge, the number of configurations is given by A265167.
