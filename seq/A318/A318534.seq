%N A318534 Lexicographically first sequence of distinct positive integers such that [a(n) + a(n+1)] or [a(n) - a(n+1)] is a palindrome in base 10.
%C A318534 Is this sequence a permutation of the positive integers?

%e A318534 The sequence starts with 1,2,3,4,5,6,16,7,15,18,9,... and we see that [1 + 2] is a palindrome (3); [2 + 3] is a palindrome (5); [3 + 4] is a palindrome (7); [4 + 5] is a palindrome (9); [5 + 6] is a palindrome (11); [6 + 16] is a palindrome (22); [16 - 7] is a palindrome (9); [7 + 15] is a palindrome (22); etc.
%Y A318534 Cf A228730 (Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct nonnegative integers such that the sum of two consecutive terms is a palindrome in base 10).
