%e A318533 The sequence starts with 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,13,9,... and we see that [1 + (the first digit of 2)] is a palindrome (3); [2 + (the first digit of 3)] is a palindrome (5); [3 + (the first digit of 4)] is a palindrome (7); [4 + (the first digit of 5)] is a palindrome (9); [5 + (the first digit of 6)] is a palindrome (11); [6 + (the first digit of 10)] is a palindrome (7); [10 + (the first digit of 13)] is a palindrome (11); [13 + (the first digit of 9)] is a palindrome (22); etc.
%Y A318533 Cf. A318486 for a subtraction of the first digit of a(n+1) instead of the addition.
