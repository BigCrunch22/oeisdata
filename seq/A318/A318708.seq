%N A318708 Terms resulting from application of a prime sieve to the digits of the decimal expansions of the positive integers.
%C A318708 Definition of sieving over the digits of k: Erase each digit 2 in the decimal expansion of k, then consolidate the remaining digits. Erase each digit 3 in what remains from the previous step, then consolidate the remaining digits. Repeat the procedure with 5, 7, ..., largest prime <= last consolidated remainder. What remains then becomes a term of the sequence. If there are no remaining digits after the procedure, this number disappears and is not a term.
%C A318708 Consolidation means the removal of all empty places at each step of the sieving process. Example: k = 1225; erasing all 2's in 1225 results in 1__5, which consolidates to 15; erasing all 3's in 15 results in 15; erasing all 5's in 15 results in 1_, which consolidates to 1. So for k = 1225 the result after sieving is 1. Example: k = 10101; erasing all 2's, ..., 97's results in 10101; erasing 101's in 10101 results in ___01, which consolidates to the last consolidated remainder 01. As there is no prime <= 01 to sieve with, the result for k = 10101 after sieving is 1.
%C A318708 Largest number of a sieve <= last consolidated remainder.
%C A318708 This sequence sieve is: {primes}. There could be other sieve definitions: {binary numbers}, {even numbers}, {odd numbers}, {triangular numbers}, predefined set of numbers like {0,3,11,27}, etc.
