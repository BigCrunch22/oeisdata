%N A318648 Lexicographically first sequence of distinct nonnegative terms whose succession of digits is the same as in its associated sequence T (see the Comments section for T).
%C A318648 T(n) is the sum [last digit of a(n) + first digit of a(n+1)].

%e A318648 The sequence starts with 21, 10, 1, 910, 11, 8, 2, 91, 71, 12, ...
%e A318648 Let's make the successive sums of [the last digit of a(n) + the first digit of a(n+1)]; we have [1+1] = 2; then [0+1] = 1; then [1+9] = 10; then [0+1] = 1; then [1+8] = 9; then [8+2] = 10; then [2+9] = 11; then [1+7] = 8; then [1+1] = 2; etc.
%e A318648 Those successive sums build the sequence T = 2, 1, 10, 1, 9, 10, 11, 8, 2, ... and T shows indeed the same succession of digits as the starting sequence.
%Y A318648 Cf. A318647 for the product (instead of the sum) of the digits "framing a comma" in the sequence.
