%N A318452 Lexicographically first sequence of different positive terms starting with a(1) = 1, such that a(n+1) is obtained by subtracting or adding to a(n) a term already in the sequence. This term can be subtracted only once and added only once.
%C A318452 This sequence is a derangement of the positive integers.

%e A318452 The sequence starts with 1,2,4,3,6,10,7,...
%e A318452 As all the terms of the sequence must be > 0, we cannot subtract 1 from term 1; thus a(2) is 1 (the last term) + the term a(1) = 1 + 1 = 2;
%e A318452 as we cannot add twice the same term, a(3) must be 2 (the last term) + a(2) = 2 + 2 = 4;
%e A318452 as the sequence must be the lexicographically first of its kind, and because all terms of the sequence must be different, we subtract the term a(1) = 1 from 4 (the last term) getting 3;
%e A318452 as we cannot subtract twice the same term, a(5) must be 3 (the last term) + the term a(4) = 3 + 3 = 6;
%e A318452 as the only available term for an addition to the last term a(5) is a(2) = 4, we have a(6) = 6 + 4 = 10;
%e A318452 as the sequence must be the lexicographically first of its kind, and because all terms of the sequence must be different, we subtract the term a(4) = 3 from 10 (the last term), getting 7;
