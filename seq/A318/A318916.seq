%N A318916 Minimum length of longest palindromic subsequence, where the minimum is taken over all binary circular words of length n.
%C A318916 Here "subsequence" means "scattered subsequence" (not necessarily contiguous).  A circular word "wraps around".
%C A318916 Slide 10 of Andrew Ryzhikov's talk contains the conjecture that a(n) >= 3n/4, but this conjecture fails for n = 2 and n = 62 (at least). The length-62 counterexample 11111111000000000001010001110110000011010011111001000111010111, where the longest palindromic subsequence is of length 45, was found by Antonio Molina Lovett.
%H A318916 Andrew Ryzhikov, <a href="https://7b394770-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/ryzandrew/slides_Ryzhikov.pdf">Regular subsequences in finite words</a>, talk for the Workshop on Words and Complexity, 19-23 Feb 2018, Villeurbanne, France.
%e A318916 Consider the circular word 0001011.  A rotation of this circular word gives 0101100, and deleting the first 1 gives the subsequence 001100, which is a palindrome of length 6. This shows that a(7) >= 6.
