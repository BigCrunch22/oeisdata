%N A318895 Number of isoclinism classes of the groups of order 2^n.
%C A318895 The concept of isoclinism was introduced in Hall (1940) and is crucial to enumerating the groups of order p^n where p is a prime.
%C A318895 An isoclinism exists between two groups G1 and G2 if the following holds: There is an isomorphism f between their two inner automorphism groups G1/Z(G1) and G2/Z(G2). There is an isomorphism h between their two commutator groups [G1, G1] and [G2, G2]. Lastly, f and h commute with F1 and F2, where F1 is the mapping from G1/Z(G1) x G1/Z(G1) to [G1, G1], given by a, b -> ab(a^-1)(b^-1), and F2 is defined analogously.

%e A318895 There are 51 groups of order 32. These fall into 8 isoclinism classes. Therefore a(5) = 8.
%Y A318895 Cf. A000001, A000679. A000041 has an interpretation as the number of Abelian groups with order 2^n.
