%N A318240 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = solution to Dagstuhl's Happy Diner Problem with n participants and tables of size at most k (n > k >= 2).
%C A318240 There are n participants at a conference, which share meals together in a room with multiple tables. Each table seats at most k participants. T(n,k) is the smallest number of meals so that each participants can share at least one meal with every other participant.
%C A318240 There is no requirement on the number of tables, participants can have a meal together more than once, and not every table needs to be fully occupied.
%C A318240 T(1,k) = 0 and T(n,k) = 1 for 1 < n <= k. These trivial values are omitted in this sequence.
%C A318240 Since every participant can sit with at most (k-1) other participants, T(n,k) >= (n-1)/(k-1).
%C A318240 If A107431(n,k) * (k-1) = n*k - 1 then T(n * k, k) = A107431(n,k).
%C A318240 If A107431(n,k) * (k-1) = n*k - 2 then T(n * k, k) = A107431(n,k) + 1.
