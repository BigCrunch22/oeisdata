%N A318655 The 2-adic valuation of A318649, the numerators of "Dirichlet Square Root" of squares.
%C A318655 Probably also the 2-adic valuation of A318511.
%H A318655 Antti Karttunen, <a href="/A318655/b318655.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..65537</a>
%F A318655 a(n) = A007814(A318649(n)).
%F A318655 It seems that for all n >= 1, a(n) <= A007814(A064549(n)) <= A007814(A000290(n)).
%o A318655 (PARI) A318655(n) = valuation(A318649(n),2); \\ Needs also code from A318649.
%Y A318655 Cf. A318511, A318649, A318651, A318652, A318654 (the positions of nonzero terms).
