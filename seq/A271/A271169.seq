%N A271169 Number of ordered ways to write n as s^5 + t^5 + 2*u^5 + 3*v^5 + 4*w^5 + 5*x^5 + 7*y^5 + 14*z^5, where s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z are nonnegative integers with s <= t.
%C A271169 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n = 0,1,2,..., and a(n) = 1 only for n = 0, 1, 2602.
%C A271169 Note that 1+1+2+3+4+5+7+14 = 37. In 1964 J.-R. Chen proved that any natural number can be written as the sum of 37 fifth powers of nonnegative integers.
%C A271169 For k = 2,3,4,... define s(k) as the smallest positive integer s such that {a(1)*x(1)^k+...+a(s)*x(s)^k: x(1),...,x(s) = 0,1,2,...} = {0,1,2,...} for some positive integers a(1), ..., a(s), and t(k) as the least positive integer t such that {a(1)*x(1)^k+...+a(t)*x(t)^k: x(1),...,x(t) = 0,1,2,...} = {0,1,2,...} for some positive integers a(1), ..., a(t) with a(1)+...+a(t) = g(k), where g(.) is given by A002804. Then s(k) <= t(k) <= g(k). Part (iii) of the conjecture in A271099 implies that t(k) <= 2k-1 for k > 2. It is easy to see that s(2) = t(2) = 4. Our computation suggests that s(3) = t(3) = 5, s(4) = t(4) = 7, s(5) = t(5) = 8 (which is smaller than 2*5-1), and s(6) = t(6) = 10. We conjecture that s(k) = t(k) for any integer k > 1, and that each natural number can be written as x(1)^6+x(2)^6+x(3)^6+2*x(4)^6+3*x(5)^6+5*x(6)^6+6*x(7)^6+10*x(8)^6+18*x(9)^6+26*x(10)^6, where x(1),x(2),...,x(10) are nonnegative integers. Note that 1+1+1+2+3+5+6+10+18+26 = 73 = g(6).
%C A271169 We also conjecture that any natural number can be written as s^5+t^5+2*u^5+3*v^5+4*w^5+6*x^5+8*y^5+12*z^5, with s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z nonnegative integers. Note that 1+1+2+3+4+6+8+12 = 37 = g(5). - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Apr 04 2016

%e A271169 a(1) = 1 since 1 = 0^5 + 1^5 + 2*0^5 + 3*0^5 + 4*0^5 + 5*0^5 + 7*0^5 + 14*0^5.
