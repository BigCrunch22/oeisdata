%N A271652 Number of n X n number squares where all (n-1)^2 2 X 2 subset diagonals have the same sum though those sums may differ.
%C A271652 A number square contains all numbers from 1 to n^2 without duplicates.
%C A271652 The 2 X 2 subset diagonal sums in these squares are equal, though those sums may differ.
%C A271652 When the single unit 2 X 2 subset is required to have diagonals with equal sums every rectangle within the generated square will have diagonals with equal sums.
%C A271652 Reversible squares are a previously defined entity. They require all symmetrically opposite pairs in each row and column to have the same sum in addition to the diagonal constraints noted above.
%C A271652 It is an embarrassment that no one has enumerated the order 6 magic squares. Richard C. Schroeppel provided the exact count for the order 5 magic squares in 1973 - now more than 40 years ago.
