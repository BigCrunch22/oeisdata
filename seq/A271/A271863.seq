%N A271863 Recursive sequence based on the central polygonal numbers (A000124) and A004736.
%C A271863 Conjectured to be a permutation of the natural numbers.
%C A271863 The central polygonal numbers can be constructed by starting with the natural numbers, setting A000124(0)=1 and obtaining A000124(n+1) by reversing the order of the next A000124(n) numbers after A000124(n). This procedure doesn't produce a permutation of the natural numbers for A000124 because the sequence is strictly increasing. The present sequence is constructed by the same procedure, except that a(n+1) is obtained by reversing the next a(A004736(n)) numbers.
