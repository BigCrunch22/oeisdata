%N A271103 Number of magic and semi-magic squares of order n composed of the numbers from 1 to n^2, counted up to rotations and reflections.
%C A271103 A semi-magic square differs from a magic square in that at least one of its main diagonals does not sum to the magic constant. [_Walter Trump_]
%C A271103 The number of order 4 magic and semi-magic squares was computed by Mutsumi Suzuki, and could be found on his former web site. Mutsumi Suzuki's pages are now in the Internet Archive.
