%N A271983 The smaller of a pair n, m such that phi(n) = phi(m) and there is no other k such that phi(n) = phi(k).
%C A271983 If phi(x) = N has exactly two solutions, x = n and x = m, say (see A007366), it is conjectured that one of n and m is odd and the other even.
%C A271983 This sequence differs from A058340 in that it contains nonprime integers.  The first few are 81, 121, 343, 361, 529, 649, 841, 961, 1219, 1331, 1537, 1633, ...
%e A271983 81 is a term because phi(81) = phi(162) = 54 (= A007366(8)).
%t A271983 (* takes about 2 minutes, can return the sequence up to terms less than 5760=Euler phi(13 primorial) *)
