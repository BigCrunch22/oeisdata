%N A354879 a(n) is the index of the Stieltjes constant at the beginning of the last set of exactly n successive constants of the same sign.
%C A354879 Sets of n successive Stieltjes constants of the same sign occur only finitely many times, so for each n there exists a first and a last such set.
%C A354879 For the indices of the Stieltjes constants at which the first set of exactly n successive constants of the same sign begins, see A354878.
%C A354879 Sequence generated using the 10^6 Stieltjes constants computed by Krzysztof Maslanka.
%F A354879 a(n) = last occurrence n in A114524 after recounting index of A114524 on index of the first Stieltjes gamma in set.
%e A354879 a(1) = 0 because StieltjesGamma(0) is the last (and the first also) Stieltjes constant that is not part of a run of more than one consecutive Stieltjes constant of the same sign.
%e A354879 a(5) = 63 because the set of 5 successive constants StieltjesGamma(63) = -390972.687, StieltjesGamma(64) = -1303180.71, StieltjesGamma(65) = -2845076.55, StieltjesGamma(66) = -4540526.609 and StieltjesGamma(67) = -4341905.139 have the same sign (negative), and no upper-indexed Stieltjes constant begins a set of exactly 5 consecutive Stieltjes constants of the same sign.
