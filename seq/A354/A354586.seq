%N A354586 Table of Sprague-Grundy values for n X m 2D Toppling Dominoes L's read by antidiagonals.
%C A354586 2D Toppling Dominoes is played in the same manner as conventional Toppling Dominoes, with the addition of toppling in the north and south directions. An n X m L is defined to be a column of n dominoes and a row of m dominoes intersecting at an endpoint for both row and column. An n X m L comprises n+m-1 dominoes.
%C A354586 T(a,b) = T(b,a).
%C A354586 It is known that alternating terms on the main diagonal are 1.
%C A354586 This table appears to approximate a fractal.
