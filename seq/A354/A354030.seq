%F A354030 For n > 1, a(n) = A174275(n) - A354028(n).
%F A354030 a(n) >= A354031(n).
%e A354030 5, being a Pythagorean prime (A002144), when raised to any power, will always give a number of the form 4m+1, therefore a(1) = a(5) = a(25) = a(125) = 1.
%e A354030 7, although itself a prime of the form 4m+3 (A002145), when raised to an even power will always give a number of the form 4m+1, therefore a(49) = a(2401) = 1.
