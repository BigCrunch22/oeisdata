%N A354382 Number of free pseudo-polyarcs with n cells.
%C A354382 See A057787 for a description of polyarcs. The pseudo-polyarcs are constructed in the same way as ordinary polyarcs, but allowing for corner-connections. Thus they generalize polyarcs in the same way that pseudo-polyominoes (aka polyplets, A030222) generalize ordinary polyominoes (A000105). They can also be viewed as the "rounded" variant of pseudo-polytans (A354380), in the same way that ordinary polyarcs are the rounded variant of ordinary polytans (A006074).
%C A354382 Two figures are considered equivalent if they differ only by a rotation or reflection.
%C A354382 The pseudo-polyarcs grow tremendously fast, much faster than most polyforms. The initial data that have been computed suggest an asymptotic growth rate of at least 36^n.
%H A354382 Aaron N. Siegel, <a href="/A354382/a354382.png">Illustration showing a(2) = 32</a>. The color of each figure corresponds to its number of symmetries.
%e A354382 a(10) = 32, because there are 32 ways of adjoining two monarcs: 7 distinct edge-to-edge joins, and 25 distinct corner-to-corner joins (including one double-corner join involving two concave arcs).
%Y A354382 Cf. A057787, A354380, A006074, A000105, A030222.
