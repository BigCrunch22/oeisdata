%N A354693 Number of unlabeled prime posets with n elements.
%C A354693 A poset P is called prime if it is not decomposable. A poset Q is called decomposable if Q can be obtained as the composition (lexicographic product) of the outer poset Q' and the inner posets Qi, 1 <= i <= r, where |Q'| = r > 1 and at least one of the posets Qi is nonsingleton.
