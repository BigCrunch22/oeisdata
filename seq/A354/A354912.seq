%N A354912 Numbers k such that the k-th composition in standard order is the sequence of run-sums of some other composition.
%C A354912 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%C A354912 Every sequence can be uniquely split into a sequence of non-overlapping runs. For example, the runs of (2,2,1,1,1,3,2,2) are ((2,2),(1,1,1),(3),(2,2)), with sums (4,3,3,4).
%e A354912 The terms and their corresponding compositions begin:
%e A354912    0: ()
%e A354912    1: (1)
%e A354912    2: (2)
%e A354912    4: (3)
%e A354912    5: (2,1)
%e A354912    6: (1,2)
%e A354912    8: (4)
%e A354912    9: (3,1)
%e A354912   10: (2,2)
%e A354912   12: (1,3)
%e A354912   13: (1,2,1)
%e A354912   16: (5)
%e A354912   17: (4,1)
%e A354912   18: (3,2)
%e A354912   20: (2,3)
%e A354912   21: (2,2,1)
%e A354912   22: (2,1,2)
%e A354912 For example, the 21st composition in standard order (2,2,1) equals the run-sums of (1,1,2,1), so 21 is in the sequence. On the other hand, no composition has run-sums equal to the 29th composition (1,1,2,1), so 29 is not in the sequence.
