%N A354492 Diagonal of A354703.
%C A354492 a(n)-n is an indicator of whether the free space between the covered grid points and the perimeter of the square is relatively large. a(n)-n > 0 for n = 7, 12, 14, 19, 24, 26, ... . A comparison with the linked illustrations from A354702 shows that in all these cases the covering square is rotated by Pi/4 and that the next outer diagonal rows of grid points are very close to the perimeter of the covering square.
%C A354492 In these cases it is favorable if the difference from n*sqrt(2) to the next larger integer is as small as possible. This also fits with 7 and 12 being terms in A084068. Since A084068(5) = 41, it is expected that a record of a(n)-n will occur at a(41) = 41^2 - A354702(41,41) = 1681 - 1624 = 57 and a(n)-n = 16.
