%N A354749 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest positive number greater than 1 that is coprime to a(n-1) and the product a(n) * a(n-1) is distinct from all previous products a(i) * a(i-1), i=2..n-1.
%C A354749 This is a variation of A354803 where all terms beyond the first must be greater than 1. In the first 1000000 terms the fixed points are 1,2,3,4,5,7, it is likely no more exist, while the smallest number not to have appeared is 2090. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A354749 See A354759 for the products of all pairs of terms.
