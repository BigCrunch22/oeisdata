%N A354960 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number not occurring earlier that is a multiple of the number of proper divisors of a(n-1).
%C A354960 The terms are concentrated along numerous lines, some of which curve upward while others curve downward. See the first linked image. Surprisingly these lines are not shared by terms which are a multiple of a given proper divisor count, but predominantly by terms sharing a certain prime factor. See the second linked image.
%C A354960 The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers although it may take an extremely large number of terms for the primes to appear; e.g., 263 has not occurred after 500000 terms. Also although the vast majority of primes will appear in their natural order, some may not; e.g., a(455) = 840, which has 31 proper divisors, so a(456) = 31, and then a(457) = 29.
%C A354960 In the first 500000 terms the only fixed points beyond the first two are 3, 4, 1159, 1207. It is possible that no more exist, although this is unknown.
