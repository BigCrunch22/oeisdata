%N A354530 Numbers k such that k^2 is a minimal number; numbers k whose square is in A007416.
%C A354530 Numbers k such that there is no m < k^2 such that d(m) = d(k^2), d = A000005. Since only squares have an odd number of divisors, also numbers k such that there is no m < k such that d(m^2) = d(k^2).
%H A354530 David A. Corneth, <a href="/A354530/b354530.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..14008</a> (first 310 terms from Jianing Song, terms <= 10^20).
%F A354530 d(a(n)^2) = A166722(n).
%e A354530 8 is a term since 8^2 = 64 has 7 divisors and no smaller number (smaller square) has that many divisors.
