%N A354687 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not yet appeared that shares a factor with a(n-1) and the difference | a(n) - a(n-1) | is distinct from all previous differences.
%C A354687 The terms are concentrated along many different lines, although three lines contain a higher concentration of terms than the others; these are similar to the three lines seen in A064413. See the linked image. The primes do not occur in their natural order, and unlike A064413, the terms proceeding and following a prime term can be high multiples of the prime.
%C A354687 In the first 200000 terms the fixed points are 1,2,6,10,68. It is plausible no more exist although this is unknown. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A354687 See A354721 for the differences between terms.

%e A354687 a(4) = 8 as a(3) = 4, and 8 is the smallest unused number that shares a factor with 4 and whose difference from the previous term,| 8 - 4 | = 4, has not appeared. Note 6 shares a factor with 4 but | 6 - 4 | = 2, and a difference of 2 has already occurred between as | a(3) - a(2) |, so 6 cannot be chosen.
