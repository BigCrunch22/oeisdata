%N A354133 Irregular table read by rows: for each interior cell of a regular n-gon with all diagonals drawn remove all its edges and then count the number of sides in the resulting polygon; row n gives the number of resulting k-sided polygons, for k >= 6, for all interior cells.
%C A354133 An interior cell is one that has no edges that form the outside of the n-gon, i.e., all of its edges are shared with another cell. The number of such cells is A007678(n) - n = A191101(n).
%C A354133 The minimum number of sides in the created k-gons is 6 - this corresponds to a triangle that is adjoined to three other triangles. Only n-gons with an even number of sides can contain these triangles as their vertices must be formed by the intersection of three or more diagonals; only even-sided polygons contain such vertices.
%C A354133 Numerous patterns appear in the terms. For odd n >= 13 there is always one 2n-sided polygon which is created by the central n-sided polygon being surrounded by n triangles, thus row(n,2n) = 1. These n triangles themselves are adjoined to the central n-gon and two 4-gons so they create an n-1 + 3 + 3 = (n+5)-sided polygon, thus row(n,n+5) = n.
%C A354133 Almost all even-n n-gons contain triangles surrounded by three other triangles and therefore have values for k=6. The exceptions for n >= 6 up to the 140-gon are n=6,10,14,22,26,46,50,58,70. It is plausible that the 70-gon is the last even-n polygon not to contain such triangles.
%C A354133 Ignoring the central n-gon and its surrounding triangles for odd-sided n-gons, the largest possible created k-gon is unknown. It is likely related to the maximum number of sides of any cell, see A349784, which is also unknown. For n <= 140 the largest created k-gon is a 34-gon which surrounds a 14-sided cell in the 132-gon. See the linked image.
%C A354133 Up to the 36-gon the most commonly created k-sided polygon is shared between k values of 8 to 13 inclusive. The 36-gon has the 11-gon as the most commonly created, but from the 37-gon up to at least the 140-gon the 12-gon becomes the most common. The distribution of k-gons for the larger n values becomes quite uniform and it is therefore possible that the 12-gon is the most commonly created polygon for all n-gons for n >= 37.

%e A354133 The 8-gon contains eight triangles that adjoin three triangles and thus create a 6-gon, thirty-two triangles that adjoin two triangles and one quadrilateral and thus create a 7-gon, eight triangles that adjoin one triangle and two quadrilaterals and thus create an 8-gon, and twenty-four quadrilaterals that adjoin two triangles and two quadrilaterals and thus create a 10-gon. Therefore row 8 is [8,32,8,0,24].
