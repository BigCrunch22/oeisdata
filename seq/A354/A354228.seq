%N A354228 Number of partitions of the multigraph G_n (defined below) into "strokes".
%C A354228 Here G_n = {V_n, E_n}, V_n = {v_1, v_2, ..., v_n}, E_n = {e_1, e_2, ..., e_{n-1}, f_1, f_2, ..., f_{n-1}}. For all i, e_i = f_i = v_iv_{i+1} although e_i and f_i are considered distinct.
%C A354228 Given an undirected multigraph G = (V,E) with labeled edges, its partition into strokes is a collection of directed edge-disjoint paths (viewed as sets of directed edges) on V such that (i) union of any two paths is not a path; (ii) union of corresponding undirected paths is E.
