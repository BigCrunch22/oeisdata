%N A354882 a(n) is the smallest number k that is divisible by all numbers d, where d < p = prime(n), and such that all of k+1, k-1, k+p, k-p are prime.
%C A354882 Suggested by _Charles Kusniec_ on the mersenneforum.org message board (see "Links" section): a number c(n) = k(n) + r(n), where k(n) = m * A099795(n), r(n) = {-1, 1, p, -p} and p = prime(n), is not divisible by any d < p. Thus c(n) has a higher probability of being prime than a random number of that magnitude, viz. the probability is approximately t(n) = 1/(((1/2)*(2/3)*(4/5)*(6/7)*...*(prime(n-1)-1)/prime(n-1)) * log(c(n))). The probability that c(n) is prime for all r(n), so that c(n) = a(n), is close to t(n)^4.
%C A354882 a(n) = m(n) * A099795(n). Specifically, m(3) = m(4) = 1. For all other n < 171: 25 < m(n) < 89229354. m(n) cannot have prime(n) as a factor.
%C A354882 For all n < 171, a(n) > a(n-1) with the exception of a(11) < a(10). This occurs whenever m(n-1) > prime(n) * m(n).
%C A354882 The principle can be extended to r(n,i) = {-1,1,-p,p,-q_i,q_i} where q_i = prime(n+i). Such a sequence b for i = 1 would have b(3) = 12, as 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 are all prime. This is the only number k for which all three of k+-1, k+-5, and k+-7 are prime. To satisfy the first requirement for k > 6, we need k == {0, 2, 8} (mod 10). Under this condition, one of k-5 or k+-7 will be divisible by 5. Since 12 - 7 = 5 is the only prime that is divisible by 5, k = 12 is the only k satisfying the condition.
%C A354882 If q, with a(n) + 1 < q < a(n) + prime(n)^2, is prime, the difference r(n) = q - a(n) is also prime. Proof: Per definition a(n) is divisible by all d < prime(n). It follows that, if r is divisible by any d, then so is q = a(n) + r, whence q is not prime. Thus, if q is prime, then r is either also prime or only has prime factors f >= prime(n), i.e., r >= prime(n)^2. See "Fortunate Numbers" (A005235).
%C A354882 There is no a(1) and a(2). Since prime(1) = 2, both k+1 and k+2 need to be prime. This is only true for k = 1, but 1 - 1 = 0 is not prime. For a(2) we have prime(2) = 3 and one of k+1, k-1, k+3 is divisible by 3.

%e A354882 a(3): The 3rd prime is 5. The smallest number divisble by all d < 5 is 12. Since 12 - 1 = 11, 12 + 1 = 13, 12 + 5 = 17, 12 - 5 = 7 are all prime, a(3) = 12.
%e A354882 a(5): The 5th prime is 11. The smallest number divisible by all d < 11 is 2520. However, 2520 - 1 = 2519 is not prime. The smallest number satisfying all conditions is 93240, since 93240 - 1, 93240 + 1, 93240 + 11, 93240 - 11 are all prime and 93240 is divisible by all d < 11. Thus, a(5) = 93240.
