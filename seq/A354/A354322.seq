%N A354322 Irregular triangle read by rows where row n lists the distinct Matula-Goebel numbers of terminal subtrees occurring in the tree with Matula-Goebel number n.
%C A354322 A terminal subtree is a vertex and all its descendents.
%C A354322 Row n has length A317713(n).
%C A354322 Row n begins with 1 which is a singleton (single childless vertex), and ends with n itself which is the whole tree.
%C A354322 The second-last term in row n >= 1 is the largest (by tree number) child subtree of the root, which is A061395(n).
%C A354322 A factor of 2 in a tree number is a singleton child, and tree number 2^c is a vertex with c singleton children and no other children.
%C A354322 The second term in each row is T(n,2) = 2^c for the subtree with the fewest singleton children and no other children.
%C A354322 A rooted star is n = 2^c and these are the only rows of length 2.
%C A354322 A path of k vertices down is the prime-th recurrence n = A007097(k-1) and its subtrees are row(n) = A007097(0 .. k-1).

%F A354322 row(n) = union of row(primepi(p)) for each p a prime factor of n, followed by n itself.
