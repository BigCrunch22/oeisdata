%N A354622 Irregular triangle read by rows: Refined 3-Narayana triangle. Coefficients of partition polynomials of A134264, a refined Narayana triangle enumerating noncrossing partitions, with all h_k other than h_0, h_3, h_6, ..., h_(3n), ... replaced by zero.
%C A354622 A set of partition polynomials with these coefficients and the polynomials of A338135 can be generated by substitution of the refined Narayana, or noncrossing partition, polynomials N_n[h_1,...,h_n] of A134264 (h_0=1) into themselves--once for A338135 and twice for this entry--or by setting the indeterminates h_n of A134264 to zero except for h_0, h_3, h_6, ..., h_(3n), ... with h_0 = 1 and ultimately re-indexing. This is equivalent to recursive use of the Lagrange inversion formula on f(x) = x / h(x) = x / (1 + h_1 x + h_2 x^2 + ...) since its compositional inverse is f^{(-1)}(x) = x + N_1(h_1) x + N_2(h_1,h_2) x^2 + .... The equivalence of the two methods of generation--the substitution and the zeroing out--follows from the general theorems stated by _Peter Bala_ in his presentation of formulas for A108767 in 2008, which stem from a fixed point-iteration formalism of a basic identity for a compositional inverse pair, x* h(f^{(-1)}(x)) = f^{(-1)}(x), where, as above, h(x) = x / f(x).
%C A354622 The sets of refined m-Narayana polynomials are used by Cachazo and Umbert to characterize the scattering amplitudes of a class of quantum fields (see, e.g., section 7.3).
%C A354622 These could also be called the refined 3-Dyck path polynomials. From the interpretation of A134264 as Dyck paths in A125181, or staircases whose steps never rise above the diagonal of a square grid (see illustrations in Weisstein), the monomials of the partition polynomial N_4 = 1 (4') + 4 (1') (3') + 2 (2')^2 + 6 (1')^2 (2') + 1 (1')^4 of A134264 have the following correspondences:
%C A354622 1 (4') --> 1 staircase of one step of height 4,
%C A354622 4 (1') (3') --> 4 staircases of 1 step of height 1 and 1 step of height 3,
%C A354622 2 (2')^2 --> 2 staircases of 2 steps of height 2,
%C A354622 6 (1')^2 (2') --> 6 staircases of 2 steps of height 1 and 1 step of height 2,
%C A354622 1 (1')^4 --> 1 staircase of 4 steps of height 1.
%C A354622 Consequently, the partition polynomials G_{3n} of this entry enumerate staircases of height 3n with steps of heights 3, 6, 9, ..., 3k, ... only.
%C A354622 Diverse combinatorial models of the refined m-Narayana, or m-Dyck, polynomials are inherited from those presented for the refined Narayana, or noncrossing partition, polynomials in A134264 and A125181 and in the references therein.
%C A354622 A127537 gives a combinatorial model (see title and Domb and Barret therein, Table 2, p. 355) that contains the coefficients of the monomials h_1^n and h_1^(n-2) h_2, i.e., A001764 and A003408.

%F A354622 Coefficients of the monomials are those of the surviving monomials of the partition polynomials of A134264 after zeroing all indeterminates other than h_0, h_3, h_6, h_9, ..., h_(3n), .... The multinomial coefficients of A125181 also apply for G_n, giving the coefficient of the monomial h_1^e_1 h_2^e_2 ... h_n^n of R_n with se := e_1 + e_2 + ... + e_n as (3n)! / ((3n-se+1)! (e_1)! (e_2)! ... (e_n)!).
%F A354622 1*e_1 + 2*e_2 + ... + n*e_n = n for each monomial of R_n.
%F A354622 The partition polynomials R_n = N_n^3 of this entry can be determined from those of A338135, N_n^2, by substituting the partition polynomials of A134264, N_n, for the indeterminate h_n = (n) of N_n^2 or by doing the same for A134264 twice. E.g., N_1(h_1) = h_1, N_2(h_1,h_2) = h_2 + h_1^2, so N_2^2(h_1,h_2) = N_2(N_1,N_2) =  N_2 + N_1 = h_2 + h_1^2 + h_1^2 = h_2 + 2 h_1^2 and N_2^3(h_1,h_2) = N_2^2(N_1,N_2) = N_2 + 2 N_1^2 = h_2 + h_1^2 + 2 h_1^2 = h_2 + 3 h_1^2.
%F A354622 Reduces with all indeterminates h_n = (n) = t to A173020.
%F A354622 The coefficient of the monomial h_1^n is (3*n)! / ((3*n-n+1)! n!) = A001764(n) (see also A179848 and A235534). In general, the coefficients of these monomials of the refined (m+1)-Narayana polynomials are the Fuss-Catalan sequence associated to the row sums of the refined m-Narayana polynomials.
%F A354622 The coefficient of the monomial h_1^(n-2) h_2 is (3n)! / ((3n-n+2)! (n-2)!) = A003408(n-2) for n > 1.
%F A354622 The coefficient of the monomial h_1^(n-3) h_3 is (3n)! / ((3n-n+3)! (n-3)!) = A004321(n) for n > 2.
