%N A354570 Ordered odd leg lengths k (listed with multiplicity) of primitive Pythagorean triangles such that all prime factors of k are congruent to 3 (mod 4).
%C A354570 Conjecture: lim_{n->oo} a(n)/n = Pi. Also, lim_{n->oo} A354571(n)/n = Pi.
%D A354570 Lothar Selle, Kleines Handbuch Pythagoreische Zahlentripel, Books on Demand, 4th impression 2022, chapter 2.2.1; see chapter 2.3.10 for identity of lim_(n->oo) A354571(n)/n.
%e A354570 3 is a term: 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2, so the triangle with sides (3,4,5) is a Pythagorean triangle; GCD(3,4,5) = 1, so it is primitive; and the odd leg length, 3, has no prime factors p that are not congruent to 3 (mod 4).
%e A354570 5 is not a term: it is the odd leg length of the primitive Pythagorean triangle (5,12,13), but 5 (a prime) == 1 (mod 4).
%e A354570 21 (whose prime factors are 3 and 7, both of which are congruent to 3 (mod 4)) is listed twice because it is the odd leg length of two primitive Pythagorean triangles ((20,21,29) and (21,220,221)).
%Y A354570 Intersection of A004614 and A120890.
