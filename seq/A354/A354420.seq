%N A354420 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive numbers such that, for n>3, a(n) has a common factor with a(n-2), shares a 1-bit in its binary expansion with a(n-2), has no common factor with a(n-1), and does not share a 1-bit in its binary expansion with a(n-1).
%C A354420 The sequence is similar to A098550 but with the addition restrictions that each new term a(n) must share a 1-bit in its binary expansion with a(n-2), while sharing no 1-bits with the binary expansion of a(n-1). Unlike A351691 no additional restrictions on the factors or 1-bits of a(n) are required for the sequence to be infinite. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
%e A354420 a(5) = 65 = 1000001_2 as a(4) = 18 = 10010_2, a(3) = 5 = 101_2, and 65 is the smallest unused number that shares a factor with 5, has a 1-bit in common with 5 in their binary expansions, does not share a factor with 18, has no 1-bit in common with 18 in their binary expansions.
