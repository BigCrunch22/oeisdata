%N A354453 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers on a square spiral such that any 2 X 2 square of numbers sums to a prime, and that prime is unique for all such squares. Start with a(1) = 0.
%C A354453 This is a variation of A337116 where the same rules apply except that the primes generated by all 2 X 2 square sums must be unique. This leads to the terms having a far greater variation in value while being concentrated along a central line which shows wave-like variations in density. See the linked image. The reason for this behavior is unknown.
%C A354453 See A354460 for the successive prime sums formed by each completed 2 X 2 square of numbers.

%e A354453 a(9) = 14 as this completes a 2 X 2 square of numbers 0,1,8,14 which sum to 23, a prime, and 14 is the smallest unused number to form a prime sum that has not occurred before. Note that 10 is unused and would form a prime sum of 19, see A337116, but 19 was formed previously by the square 6,0,5,8, so cannot be used. This is the first term to differ from A337116.
