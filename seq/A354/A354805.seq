%N A354805 Triangle T(n,k) is an array of characteristic functions of primes involved in Goldbach's partitions of 2n.
%C A354805 The triangle T(n, k) consists of zeros and ones where row n is a sort of characteristic function of the primes used in Goldbach's partition of 2n into two odd primes by means of the indices k of the ones, these indices giving the deviation from n of the selected primes.
%C A354805 It can be observed that, in table T considered as a matrix, diagonals and antidiagonals starting at position (n,0) with n composite are all zeros.

%F A354805 Where T(n,k) is 1, the corresponding partition of 2n is (n-k, n+k).

%e A354805 Example: row 11 is {1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1}, then, indices k of ones are 0, 6, 8, so, adding 11 gives back the primes 11, 17, 19 and (subtracting from 22) the partition {{11, 11}, {17, 5}, {19, 3}}.
