%N A354575 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not yet appeared that is coprime to a(n-1) and the difference a(n) - a(n-1) is distinct from all previous differences.
%C A354575 This sequence uses a similar rule to A354688 but here the sign of the difference between a(n-1) and a(n) is considered. This leads to the terms showing much more erratic behavior than A354688; see the linked image.
%C A354575 In the first 200000 terms the fixed points are 1,2,8,35, and it is likely no more exist. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A354575 See A354679 for the differences between terms.
%H A354575 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A354575/a354575.png">Image of the first 200000 terms</a>. The green line is y = n.
%e A354575 a(9) = 15 as a(8) = 8, and 15 is the smallest unused number that is coprime to 8 and whose difference from the previous term, 15 - 8 = 7, has not appeared. Note that 11 and 13 are coprime to 8 but their differences from 8, namely 3 and 5, have already appeared as differences between previous pairs of terms.
%e A354575 a(15) = 13 as a(14) = 19, and 13 is the smallest unused number that is coprime to 19 and whose difference from the previous term, 13 - 19 = -6, has not appeared. Note that 12 is coprime to 19 and smaller than 13 but its difference from 19, namely -7, has already appeared as a difference between a(13) and a(12).
