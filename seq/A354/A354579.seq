%N A354579 Number of distinct lengths of runs in the n-th composition in standard order.
%C A354579 Every sequence can be uniquely split into a sequence of non-overlapping runs. For example, the runs of (2,2,1,1,1,3,2,2) are ((2,2),(1,1,1),(3),(2,2)), with lengths (2,3,1,2).
%C A354579 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%e A354579 The positions of first appearances together with the corresponding compositions begin:
%e A354579        1: (1)
%e A354579       11: (2,1,1)
%e A354579      119: (1,1,2,1,1,1)
