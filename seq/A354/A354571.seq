%N A354571 Ordered even leg lengths k (listed with multiplicity) of primitive Pythagorean triangles such that all odd prime factors of k are congruent to 3 (mod 4) and at least one prime factor is odd.
%C A354571 Conjecture: lim_{n->oo} a(n)/n = Pi. Also, lim_{n->oo} A354570(n)/n = Pi.
%D A354571 Lothar Selle, Kleines Handbuch Pythagoreische Zahlentripel, Books on Demand, 4th impression 2022, chapter 2.3.3, see chapter 2.3.10 for identity of lim_{n->oo} A354570(n)/n.
%e A354571 12 is a term and is listed twice: it is the even leg length of the Pythagorean triangles (5,12,13) and (12,35,37); GCD(5,12,13) = GCD(12,35,37) = 1, so they are primitive; and 12 = 2^2 * 3 has no odd prime factors p that are not congruent to 3 (mod 4).
%e A354571 4 is not a term: it is the even leg length of the primitive Pythagorean triangle (3,4,5), but 4 = 2^2 has no odd prime factors.
%e A354571 20 is not a term: it is the even leg length of the primitive Pythagorean triangles (20,21,29) and (20,99,101), but 20 = 2^2 * 5 has an odd prime factor (5) that is not congruent to 3 (mod 4).
