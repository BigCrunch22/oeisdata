%N A354367 Successive pairs of terms (a, b) such that (a + b) is a square and at least one of a and b is a prime number. This is the lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct terms > 0 with this property.
%C A354367 This is not a permutation of the integers > 0 as no square > 4 will appear. Two prime terms can form a pair (2 and 7 for instance) but at least one term must be prime [the pair (1, 3) is ok].
