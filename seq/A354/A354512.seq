%N A354512 Number of solutions m >= 2 to m - gpf(m) = n, gpf = A006530.
%C A354512 Number of primes p such that gpf(n+p) = p (such p must be prime factors of n).
%C A354512 Number of distinct prime factors p of n such that n+p is p-smooth.
%C A354512 Clearly we have a(n) <= omega(n) for all n, omega = A001221. The differences are given by A354527.
%C A354512 Is this sequence unbounded? Note that 4 does not appear until a(1660577).

%e A354512 a(78) = 2 since the prime factors of 78 are 2,3,13, and we have gpf(78+3) = 3 and gpf(78+13) = 13, so the solutions to m - gpf(m) = 78 are m = 78+3 = 81 or m = 78+13 = 91. Note that gpf(78+2) != 2.
%e A354512 a(12) = 0 since the prime factors of 12 are 2,3, and we have gpf(12+2) != 2 and gpf(12+3) != 3.
