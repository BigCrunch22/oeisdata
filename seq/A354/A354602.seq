%N A354602 a(n) is the number of trivial braids on 3 strands with 2*n crossings.
%C A354602 In other words, a(n) is the number of products of 2*n generators in the braid group B_3 which are equal to the identity element of the group.
%C A354602 Only braids with an even number of crossings are considered because a braid with an odd number of crossings cannot be trivial.
%C A354602 If we do include the 0s corresponding to the odd values of the number of crossings, a group-theoretical name for this sequence is the cogrowth sequence of B_3.
%Y A354602 Cf. A000984 (number of trivial braids on 2 strands with 2*n crossings), A047849 (number of trivial permutations of 3 elements after 2*n adjacent transpositions).
