%N A354464 Number of distinct bracelets of length n (A000029) that eventually result in a cycle when used as the starting conditions for a rule 161 cellular automaton in a cyclic universe of circumference n.

%C A354464 There's only a finite number of possible states, so *any* initial state will eventually lead to a cycle . Second, in the example, I can't see how 1100 qualifies when 0000 does not. We have the transitions 1100 -> 0000 -> 1111 -> 1111, so both 1100 and 0000 end up in the loop at 1111. When I computed the number of initial bracelets that end up in a cycle of length at least two, I get numbers of somewhat similar sizes as here: 0, 1, 0, 3, 6, 5, 0, 21, 41, 72, 123, 196, 263, 141, 18, 1440, 4096, but maybe this is just a red herring.
%C A354464 The reason why a(4) counts 1100 but not 0000 when they both lead to the same cycle (in this case of length 1) remains a mystery.

%e A354464 For n = 4, the six bracelets are 0000, 1000, 1100, 1010, 1110, 1111. a(4)=1 because only 1100 eventually enters a cycle. [This is obviously false. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 03 2022]
