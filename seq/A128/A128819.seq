%N A128819 Dimensions in which the simplex has two intermediate skeletons with the same centroid.
%C A128819 "There are infinitely many dimensions in which this phenomenon occurs.... They are quite sparse -- sparser than the prime integers.... It is impossible in any dimension for there to be three intermediate skeletons with the same centroid" [Krantz, p. 13].
