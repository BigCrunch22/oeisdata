%N A128008 Numerators of rational-valued radii of circles given by 3 distinct integer points in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space.
%C A128008 A triangle in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space defines a circumcircle. There exist only certain rational-valued circumradii if the vertices of the triangle have integer coordinates. They are rendered by the pair of sequences A128008/A128009 in increasing order.
%Y A128008 See A128009 for denominators. Cf. A128006, A128007, A128010, A128011.
