%N A128333 a(0) = 0; for n > 0, a(n) = a(n-1)/2 if that number is an integer and not already in the sequence, otherwise a(n) = 3*a(n-1) + 1.
%C A128333 Other than a(0) = 0, the sequence misses all multiples of 3. Does it eventually hit all positive non-multiples of 3?

%e A128333 Consider n = 3. We have a(3) = 2 and try to divide by 2. The result, 1, is certainly an integer, but we cannot use it because 1 is already in the sequence. So we must multiply by 3 and add 1 instead, getting a(4) = 3*2 + 1 = 7.
