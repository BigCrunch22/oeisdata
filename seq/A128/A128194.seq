%N A128194 Absolute value of second differences of values of n for Cullen primes in A005849.
%C A128194 In this sequence a(3) and a(5) are primes. Also a(1)+1, a(6)+1 and a(7)+1 are primes. And a(10)-1 is prime. These may at some future time begin three new sequences.
%F A128194 Find the absolute value of second differences of overlapping pairs of values of n
%e A128194 a(0)=4432 because the first two values of first differences in A128193 are 140 and 4572. 4572-140=4432, the first second difference.
