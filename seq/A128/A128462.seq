%N A128462 Nontrivial products of two lucky numbers.
%C A128462 This is to Lucky numbers (A000959) greater than 1, as semiprimes (A001358) are to primes (A000040). Since A000959(1) = 1, dropping the word "nontrivial" gives "product of two lucky numbers" = {a(i)} UNION A000959 = {1, 3, 7, 9, 13, 15, 21, 25, 27, 31, 33, 37, 39, 43, 45, 49, 51, 63, 67, 69, 73, 75, 79, 81, 87, 91, 93, 99, ...}.
%F A128462 Product set of {A000959(n) for n>1} = {A000959(i)*A000959(j) for i, j > 1}.
%Y A128462 Cf. A000959, A001358.
