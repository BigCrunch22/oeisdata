%N A128127 The number of regular pentagons found by constructing n equally-spaced points on each side of the pentagon and drawing lines parallel to the pentagon side.
%C A128127 A similar pattern of construction to A000330 (dividing a square), A002717 (dividing a triangle), dividing a hexagon and any other polygon in a similar fashion (sequences pending).
%C A128127 Use 1 midpoint (resp. 2 points) on each side placed to divide each side into 2 (resp. 3) equally-sized segments or so on, do the same construction for every side of the pentagon so that each side is equally divided in the same way. Connect all such points to each other with lines that are parallel to at least 1 side of the polygon.

%F A128127 a(n) = (10*n^2 - 4*n + 5 -(-1)^n)/4 (conjectural).
%e A128127 With 0 point, there is only 1 pentagon, the original one. With 1 point (a midpoint on each side), 3 regular pentagons are found. With two points, 9 regular pentagons are found in total.
