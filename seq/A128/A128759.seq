%N A128759 Least k such that the Jacobsthal function A048669(k) = n.
%C A128759 Except for a(1) and a(2), the same as A070971. It appears that a(2n)=2a(n) for odd n. Because the primorial numbers (A002110) yield record values of the Jacobsthal function, we have a(A048670(n))=A002110(n). Note that numbers in this sequence up to n=18 have the form p#, p#/2, p#/q, or p#/(2q), where p and q are primes with 2<q<p and p# denotes the product of the primes up to p.
