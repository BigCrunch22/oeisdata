%N A128670 Least number k > 0 such that k^n does not divide the denominator of generalized harmonic number H(k,n) nor the denominator of alternating generalized harmonic number H'(k,n).
%C A128670 Generalized harmonic numbers are defined as H(m,k) = Sum_{j=1..m}1/j^k. Alternating generalized harmonic numbers are defined as H'(m,k) = Sum_{j=1..m} (-1)^(j+1)/j^k.
%C A128670 Some apparent periodicity in {a(n)} (not without exceptions): a(n) = 20 for n = 2 + 4m, a(n) = 42 for n = 4 + 12m and 8 + 12m, a(n) = 76 for n = 9 + 18m, a(n) = 77 for n = 1 + 10m, a(n) = 104 for n = 7 + 12m, a(n) = 110 for n = 12m, a(n) = 136 for n = 25 + 32m, etc.
