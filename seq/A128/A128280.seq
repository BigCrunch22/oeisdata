%N A128280 a(n) is the least number not occurring earlier such that a(n)+a(n-1) is prime, a(0) = 0.
%C A128280 Original definition: start with a(1) = 2. See A055265 for start with a(1) = 1.
%C A128280 The sequence may well be a rearrangement of natural numbers. Interestingly, subsets of first n terms are permutations of 1..n for n = {2, 4, 8, 10, 18, 22, 24, 56, ...}. E.g., first 56 terms: {2, 1, 4, 3, 8, 5, 6, 7, 10, 9, 14, 15, 16, 13, 18, 11, 12, 17, 20, 21, 22, 19, 24, 23, 30, 29, 32, 27, 26, 33, 28, 25, 34, 37, 36, 31, 40, 39, 44, 35, 38, 41, 42, 47, 50, 51, 46, 43, 54, 49, 48, 53, 56, 45, 52, 55} are a permutation of 1..56.
%C A128280 Without altering the definition nor the existing values, one can as well start with a(0) = 0 and get (conjecturally) a permutation of the nonnegative integers. This sequence is in some sense the "arithmetic" analog of the "digital" variant A231433: Here we add subsequent terms, there the digits are concatenated. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 09 2013
%C A128280 The sequence is also a particular case of "among the pairwise sums of any M consecutive terms, N are prime", with M = 2, N = 1. For other M, N see A329333, A329405 ff, A329449 ff and the OEIS Wiki page. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 24 2019
