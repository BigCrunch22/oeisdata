%N A128832 Number of n-tuples where each entry is chosen from the subsets of {1,2,3,4} such that the intersection of all n entries is empty.
%C A128832 The general formula where each entry is chosen from the subsets of {1,...,k} is (2^n-1)^k. This may be shown by exhibiting a bijection to a set whose cardinality is obviously (2^n-1)^k, namely the set of all k-tuples with each entry chosen from the 2^n-1 proper subsets of {1,...,n}, i.e., for of the k entries {1,...,n} is forbidden. The bijection is given by (X_1,...,X_n) |-> (Y_1,...,Y_k) where for each j in {1,...,k} and each i in {1,...,n}, i is in Y_j if and only if j is in X_i. Sequence A060867 is the case where the entries are chosen from subsets of {1,2}.

%e A128832 a(1) = (2^1 - 1)^4 = 1 because only one tuple of length one, namely ({}), has an empty intersection of its sole entry.
