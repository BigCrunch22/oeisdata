%N A128380 A097806^24 * A000594.
%C A128380 Conjecture: Given the infinite set of sequences generated from the pairwise operation on A000594 (A097806^k * A000594), k = 24, (A128380) is the only sequence in the set with a zero. The sequence generated from k=23 = (1, -1, -47, 23, 1081, 47, -15939,...). Analogous conjecture with the partial sum operator: (Cf. A128378, A128379); in which zeros are conjectured to occur only with k=23 and k=24. A128380 mod 24 = 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -4, 0, 0, 16,...
%F A128380 Pairwise operation performed 24 times on A000594
%Y A128380 Cf. A000594, A097806, A128378, A128379.
