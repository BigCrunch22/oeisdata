%N A128831 Number of n-tuples where each entry is chosen from the subsets of {1,2,3} such that the intersection of all n entries is empty.
%C A128831 The general formula where each entry is chosen from the subsets of {1,..,k} is (2^n-1)^k. This may be shown by exhibiting a bijection to a set whose cardinality is obviously (2^n-1)^k, namely the set of all k-tuples with each entry chosen from the 2^n-1 proper subsets of {1,..,n}, i.e. for of the k entries {1,..,n} is forbidden. The bijection is given by (X_1,..,X_n) |-> (Y_1,..,Y_k) where for each j in {1,..,k} and each i in {1,..,n}, i is in Y_j if and only if j is in X_i. Sequence A060867 is the case where the entries are chosen from subsets of {1,2}.

%e A128831 a(1)=(2^1-1)^3=1 because only one tuple of length one, namely ({}) has an empty intersection of its sole entry.
%e A128831 a(2)=27 because the valid 2-tuples are: ({},{}), ({},{1}), ({},{2}), ({},{3}), ({},{1,2}), ({},{1,3}), ({},{2,3}), ({},{1,2,3}), ({1},{}), ({2},{}), ({3},{}), ({1,2},{}), ({1,3},{}), ({2,3},{}), ({1,2,3},{}), ({1},{2}), ({1},{3}), ({1},{2,3}), ({2},{1}), ({2},{3}), ({2},{1,3}), ({3},{1}), ({3},{2}), ({3},{1,2}), ({1,2},{3}), ({1,3},{2}), ({2,3},{1})
