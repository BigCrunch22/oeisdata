%N A128556 a(1)=1. a(n) = the smallest positive multiple of d(a(n-1)) that does not occur earlier in the sequence, where d(m) is the number of positive divisors of m.
%C A128556 Is this sequence is a permutation of the positive integers?

%e A128556 a(9) = 24 has 8 positive divisors. So a(10) is the smallest positive multiple of 8 that has yet to appear in the sequence. 8 occurs among the first 9 terms of the sequence, but 16 does not. So a(10) = 16.
