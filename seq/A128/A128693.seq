%N A128693 Numbers of the form 3^k*p, where 1 <= k <= 6 and p is a prime different from 3.
%C A128693 Auxiliary sequence for A128694 which gives the number of groups of order a(n).
%C A128693 a(n) is a subset of the composite numbers m having the property that tau(3*m)=tau(m)+2, where tau(m)=A000005(m) (the number of divisors of m). All primes except 3 satisfy this property. - _Gary Detlefs_, Jan 25 2019
