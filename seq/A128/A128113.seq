%F A128113 After 240th term, a(n) equals the sum between [A055684(n/3) + 1 for n != 0 mod 3, otherwise 0] and [A055684(n/4) + A128115(n/4) + 1 for n != 0 mod 4, otherwise 0].
%e A128113 The first nonzero term, a(6)=1, represents the polyhedron with least edges: the tetrahedron. There is no polyhedron with 7 edges and no polyhedron with 8 edges is uniform, a(9)=1 represents the triangular prism, the next nonzero term, a(12), is 3 because there are the tetrahemihexahedron, the cube and the octahedron.
