%N A128866 Number of n-tuples where each entry is chosen from the subsets of {1,2,3,4,5} such that the intersection of all n entries contains exactly one element.
%C A128866 There is the following general formula: The number T(n,k,r) of n-tuples where each entry is chosen from the subsets of {1,2,..,k} such that the intersection of all n entries contains exactly r elements is: T(n,k,r) = C(k,r) * (2^n - 1)^(k-r). This may be shown by exhibiting a bijection to a set whose cardinality is obviously C(k,r) * (2^n - 1)^(k-r), namely the set of all k-tuples where each entry is chosen from subsets of {1,..,n} in the following way: Exactly r entries must be {1,..,n} itself (there are C(k,r) ways to choose them) and the remaining (k-r) entries must be chosen from the 2^n-1 proper subsets of {1,..,n}, i.e. for each of the (k-r) entries, {1,..,n} is forbidden (there are, independent of the choice of the full entries, (2^n - 1)^(k-r) possibilities to do that, hence the formula). The bijection into this set is given by (X_1,..,X_n) |-> (Y_1,..,Y_k) where for each j in {1,..,k} and each i in {1,..,n}, i is in Y_j if and only if j is in X_i.
