%N A128291 Complement of A118248.
%C A128291 Also: Numbers whose binary representation is a substring of the concatenation of the binary representation of all smaller nonnegative integers not listed earlier. - _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 29 2012

%e A128291 The first term is 3, smallest integer whose binary representation "11"[2] is a substring of the concatenation of the smaller numbers 0,1,2 ~> concat(0,1,10)="0110".
%e A128291 Next is 5="101"[2], which is a substring of concat(0,1,2="10",4="100") = "0110100". Note that 3, since it occurs earlier, is excluded from the list of numbers which are concatenated. - _M. F. Hasler_, Dec 29 2012
