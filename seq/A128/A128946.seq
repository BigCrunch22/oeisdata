%C A128946 A003618(a(n)) is in A001097 (Twin primes).
%C A128946 No twin prime can have only 9s as its digits because any number consisting of only 9s must be divisible by 3 and 9. Therefore, to find the largest prime p less than 10^n that is a twin prime, one needs only to test whether p-2 is prime. - _Harvey P. Dale_, Jul 26 2024
%e A128946 For n=1, 10^1 = 10. 7, the greatest prime < 10, is a member of the twin prime pair 5,7.
