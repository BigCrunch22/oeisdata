%N A128998 Length of shortest addition-subtraction chain for n.
%C A128998 Equivalently, the minimal total number of multiplications and divisions required to compute an n-th power. This is useful for exponentiation on, for example, elliptic curves where division is cheap (as proposed by Morain and Olivos, 1990). Addition-subtraction chains are also defined for negative n. Various bounds and a rules to construct a(n) up to n=42 can be found in Volger (1985).
%C A128998 a(n) < A003313(n) for n in A229624. - _T. D. Noe_, May 02 2007
