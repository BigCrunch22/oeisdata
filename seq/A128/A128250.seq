%N A128250 LCG periods: periods of the output sequences produced by multiplicative linear congruential generators (LCGs) with prime moduli, for all valid combinations of multiplier and modulus.
%C A128250 The periods of these output sequences need to be known when designing LCG-based pseudorandom number generators. The period of an LCG output is always 1 when a = 1, always 2 when a = m-1 and maximal (i.e. m-1) only if a is a totative of m. There is no fast method for finding totative values when m is large. The sample shows the terms generated by the first 8 moduli (i.e. primes from 2 to 19), as generated by: A = LCG_periods(19) (see program).
%C A128250 Apparently this is A086145 with a top row added. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jun 14 2008
%F A128250 Multiplicative LCG for modulus m, multiplier a: x(n+1) == a*x(n) mod m. Additional restriction: a < m (as assumed in many applications). The output sequence for any explicit combination of m,a,x0 is always periodic and the period is independent of x0. Therefore denote the period by p(m,a). Let Q be the lower triangular matrix that is produced by tabulating all p(m,a) values, such that the rows represent m values (successive primes) and the columns represent a values (from 1 to m-1). Then A is the sequence obtained by concatenating the rows of this matrix.
