%N A128007 Denominators of rational-valued radii of circles given by 3 distinct integer points in the Euclidean plane.
%C A128007 A triangle in the Euclidean plane defines a circumcircle. There exist only certain rational-valued circumradii if the vertices of the triangle have integer coordinates. The circumradii are rendered by the pair of sequences A128006/A128007 in increasing order.
%Y A128007 See A128006 for numerators.
