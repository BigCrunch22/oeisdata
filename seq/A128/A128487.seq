%N A128487 Irregular array where n-th row is the positive integers < n which are coprime to exactly one distinct prime divisor of n.
%C A128487 Number of terms in n-th row is A126080(n). Row 1 has zero terms, so the first listed row is row 2.
%e A128487 Concerning row 12: 1,5,7,11 don't appear because they are each coprime to 2 AND 3 (the distinct prime divisors of 12). 6 doesn't appear because it is coprime to neither prime dividing 12. The row consists of 2,3,4,8,9,10 because each term is coprime to exactly one prime divisor of 12 (i.e., is coprime to 2 or 3, but not to both).
