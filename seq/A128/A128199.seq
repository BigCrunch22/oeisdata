%N A128199 a(n) = the number of primes S possible, if S = product of b(k)'s + product of c(k)'s, where the distinct positive integers <= n are partitioned into the two sets {b(k)} and {c(k)}.
%C A128199 a(0)=a(1)=1 because the product over the empty set is defined here as 1. For S to be a prime, the positive integers <= n, except 1 and the primes > n/2, must all be together in either {b(k)} or {c(k)}. If p is a prime where n/2 < p <= n, then it is possible that p is in either product of the S sum, as can 1.
%e A128199 For n = 5 we have the primes 23 = 1*2*4 + 3*5, 29 = 1*2*3*4 + 5, 43 = 1*2*4*5 + 3, so a(5)=3.
