%N A128269 a(1)=1; a(n) = lcm((number of earlier terms which are coprime to n), (sum of the earlier terms which are coprime to n)).
%C A128269 For n > 2, a(n) is even since by induction the sum of coprimes is 1+1+some even numbers. Therefore a(n) = 2 for even n > 2 since only the 1's are coprime.

%e A128269 Among {a(1),a(2),...a(8)} the terms which are coprime to 9 are a(1)=a(2)=1 and a(3)=a(4)=a(6)=a(8)=2. There are 6 such terms. And the sum of these terms is 10. So a(8) = lcm(6,10) = 30.
