%N A128010 Numerators of rational-valued radii of circles given by 3 distinct integer points in the 4-dimensional Euclidean space.
%C A128010 A triangle in the 4-dimensional Euclidean space defines a circumcircle. There exist only certain rational-valued circumradii if the vertices of the triangle have integer coordinates. They are listed by the pair of sequences A128010/A128011 in increasing order.
%Y A128010 See A128011 for denominators. Cf. A128006, A128007, A128008, A128009.
