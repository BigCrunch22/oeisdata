%N A128310 List of maximal breaks in generalized snooker.
%C A128310 Given A000217(R) red balls and C colored balls. For every red ball 1 point for it and C+1 points for the highest colored ball, followed by 2+3+4+... points for all colored balls. This sequence contains all numbers on the form A000217(R)*(C+2)+A000217(C+1)-1, R>0, C>0 (sorted, duplicates removed).
%e A128310 Let R=2 (1 point each) and C=3 (2, 3 and 4 (call that one black) points). The sequence red-black-red-black-red-black-2-3-black gives 24 points. Thus 24 is an element in this sequence.
