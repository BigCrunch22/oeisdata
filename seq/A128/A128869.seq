%N A128869 a(n) = the largest number one can subtract from 10^n such that the square of the result is strictly greater than 10^(2*n-1).
%C A128869 Let a(n) := max{ a in N: (10^n-a)^2 > 10^(2*n-1) } then a(n) = floor(10^n*(1-sqrt(0.1))) is easily obtained by solving a quadratic equation. When proving that a(n) satisfies the definition, one has to use the following inequality, due to the fact that 10^n*(1-sqrt(0.1)) is never an integer: floor(10^n*(1-sqrt(0.1))) < 10^n*(1-sqrt(0.1)).
%C A128869 The exponent (2*n - 1) in the definition of the sequence was chosen because with a number of n decimal digits, the greater of the two possible lengths obtained when squaring it is 2*n. Since 10^(2*n-1) is the smallest decimal number with 2*n digits, (10^n - a(n)) gives the minimum number to obtain the maximum length by squaring it.
%F A128869 a(n) = floor(10^n*(1-sqrt(0.1))) That means that a(n) gives the decimal expansion of 1-sqrt(0.1).
%e A128869 a(1) = 6 because (10-6)^2 = 4^2 > 10 = 10^(2*1-1) whereas (10-7)^2 = 3^2 <= 10.
%e A128869 a(2) = 68 because (100-68)^2 = 32^2 > 1000 = 10^(2*2-1) whereas
%e A128869 (100-69)^2 = 31^2 <= 1000.
