%N A128902 Number of degree n polynomials over GF(2) (with nonzero constant term) at Hamming distance 2 from some irreducible polynomial.
%H A128902 G. Lee, F. Ruskey and A. Williams, <a href="http://www.cs.uvic.ca/~ruskey/Publications/DistGF2/DistGF2.html">Hamming distance from irreducible polynomials over GF(2)</a>
%e A128902 The coefficient vectors of the three degree 4 irreducible polynomials are 10011, 11111 and 11001. There is only one polynomial whose Hamming distance is two (or more) from all of them, namely 10101. Thus a(4) = |{10101}| = 1.
