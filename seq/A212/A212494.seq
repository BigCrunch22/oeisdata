%N A212494 Base 2i representation of nonnegative integers.
%C A212494 The use of negabinary dispenses with the need for sign bits and for keeping track of signed and unsigned data types. Similarly, the use of base 2i, or quater-imaginary, dispenses with the need to represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number separately. (The term "quater-imaginary" appears in Knuth's landmark book on computer programming).
%C A212494 Quater-imaginary, based on the powers of 2i (twice the imaginary unit), uses the digits 0, 1, 2, 3. For purely real positive integers, the quater-imaginary representation is the same as negaquartal (base -4) except that 0's are "riffled" in, corresponding to the odd-indexed powers of 2i which are purely imaginary numbers. Therefore, to obtain the base 2i representations of positive real numbers, the algorithm for base -4 representations can be employed with only a small adjustment.
%C A212494 To obtain the base 2i representation of a complex number a+bi, do as above for the real part, then again for the real part of 2i*(a+bi) = -2b+2ai, giving the digits corresponding to the odd-indexed powers of 2i.
%C A212494 Omitting digits for odd powers of 2i (all 0's for the imaginary parts) (e.g. 20300 --> 230) gives A007608 (nonnegative integers in base -4).
