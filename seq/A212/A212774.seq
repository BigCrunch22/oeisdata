%N A212774 Amounts (in cents) of coins in denominations 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 (cents) which, when using the minimal number of coins, have equal numbers of all denominations used.
%C A212774 Nonnegative integers representable as a linear combination of 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 with nonnegative coefficients, minimal sum of coefficients, and all nonzero coefficients equal.
%C A212774 Includes all nonnegative multiples of 50 and every term > 204 is a multiple of 50.
%C A212774 Unlike A212773, here it is permitted--and necessary--to use a single denomination for some amounts; otherwise, this sequence would be finite.

%F A212774 a(n) = (n-41)*50 for n >= 46.
%e A212774 a(37) = 91 is a term because the minimal number of coins to equal the amount 91 is five, 91 = 1*1 + 1*5 + 1*10 + 1*25 + 1*50, and there is one of each of the five denominations used.
%e A212774 a(45) = 204 is a term because the minimal number of coins for 204 is eight, 204 = 4*1 + 4*50, and there are four of each of the two denominations used.
%e A212774 Although 12 can be represented as 12*1 or 2*1 + 2*5, requiring 12 or 4 coins and each otherwise meeting the criteria, three (2*1 + 1*10) is the minimal number of coins required and 2 does not equal 1, so 12 is not a term.
