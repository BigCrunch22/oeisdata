%N A212357 Coefficients for the cycle index polynomial for the cyclic group C_n multiplied by n, n>=1, read as partition polynomial.
%C A212357 The partitions are ordered like in Abramowitz-Stegun (for the reference see A036036, where also a link to a work by C. F. Hindenburg from 1779 is found where this order has been used).
%C A212357 The row lengths sequence is A000041. The number of nonzero entries in row nr. n is  A000005(n).
%C A212357 The cycle index (multivariate polynomial) for the cyclic group C_n, called Z(C_n), is (sum(phi(k)*x_k^{n/k} ,k divides n))/n, n>=1, with Euler's totient function phi(n)= A000010(n). See the Harary and Palmer reference. For the coefficients of Z(C_n) in different tabulations see also A054523 and A102190.

%F A212357 The cycle index polynomial for the cyclic group C_n is Z(C_n) = (a(n,k)*x[1]^(e[k,1])*x[2]^(e[k,2])*...*x[n]^(e[k,n]))/n, n>=1, if the k-th partition of n in Abramowitz-Stegun order is 1^(e[k,1]) 2^(e[k,2]) ... n^(e[k,n]), where a part j with vanishing exponent e[k,j] has to be omitted. The n dependence of the exponents has been suppressed. See the comment above for the Z(C_n) formula and the link for these polynomials for n=1..15.
%F A212357 a(n,k) is the coefficient the term of n*Z(C_n) corresponding to the k-th partition of n in Abramowitz-Stegun order. a(n,k) = 0 if there is no such term in Z(C_n).
