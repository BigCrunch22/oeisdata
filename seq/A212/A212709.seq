%N A212709 Positive integers not of the form p * c^2 + b^2, with p prime and c and b nonzero integers.
%C A212709 Many numbers can be ruled out from membership in this sequence with the case c = 1, which then corresponds to p + b^2 (see A064233).
%C A212709 If a positive integer is of the form p * c^2 + b^2, then it may potentially have two different factorizations in Z[sqrt(-p)] (assuming that is not a unique factorization domain, of course): the familiar factorization in Z, and (c + b sqrt(-p))(c - b sqrt(-p)).
%C A212709 There are no more terms <= 2*10^9. - _Donovan Johnson_, May 30 2012
%e A212709 Since 24 can be expressed as 5 * 2^2 + 2^2, it is not in the sequence.
%e A212709 No such expression exists for 25, hence it is in the sequence.
%e A212709 Since 26 can be expressed as 17 * 1^2 + 3^2, it is not in the sequence.
