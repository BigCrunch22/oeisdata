%N A212169 List of highly composite numbers (A002182) with an exponent in its prime factorization that is at least as great as the number of positive exponents; intersection of A002182 and A212165.
%C A212169 Sequence can be used to find the largest highly composite number in subsequences of A212165 (of which there are several in the database).
%C A212169 Ramanujan showed that, in the canonical prime factorization of a highly composite number with largest prime factor prime(n), the largest exponent cannot exceed 2*log_2(prime(n+1)). (See formula 54 on page 15 of the Ramanujan paper.) This limit is less than n for all n >= 9 (and prime(n) >= 23).
%C A212169 1. Direct calculation verifies this for 9 <= n <= 11.
%C A212169 2. Nagura proved that, for any integer m >= 25, there is always a prime between m and 1.2*m.  Let n = 11, at which point prime(11) = 31 and log_2(prime(n+1)) = log 37/log 2 = 5.209453.... Since log 1.2/log 2 is only 0.263034..., it follows that n must increase by at least 3k before 2*log_2(prime(n+1)) can increase by 2k, for all values of k. Therefore, 2*log_2(prime(n+1)) can never catch up to prime(n) for n > 11.
%C A212169 665280 = 2^6*3^3*5*7*11 is the largest highly composite number whose prime factorization contains an exponent that is strictly greater than the number of positive exponents in that factorization (including the implied 1's).

%e A212169 A002182(62) = 294053760 = 2^7*3^3*5*7*11*13*17 has 7 positive exponents in its prime factorization, including 5 implied 1's. The maximal exponent in its prime factorization is also 7. Therefore, 294053760 is a term of this sequence.
