%N A212176 Row n of table lists exponents in canonical prime factorization of A181800(n) (n-th powerful number that is the first integer of its prime signature), in nonincreasing order.
%C A212176 A212179(n) gives length of row n.
%C A212176 Table represents prime signature (cf. A212171) and second signature (cf. A212172) of A181800.

%F A212176 Row n is identical to row A181800(n) of tables A212171 and A212172.
%e A212176 Since 72 is a member of A181800, all positive exponents in its prime factorization (2^3*3^2) equal or exceed 2. Therefore, its second signature is the same as its prime signature, namely, {3,2} (nonincreasing version).  Since 72 = A181800 (8), row 8 represents the prime signature and second signature {3,2}.
%Y A212176 Cf. A181800, A212171, A212172, A212179.
