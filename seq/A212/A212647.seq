%N A212647 a(n) = product of exponents in canonical prime factorization of A181800(n) (n-th powerful number that is the first integer of its prime signature); a(1) = 1 by convention.
%C A212647 The product of exponents in the canonical prime factorization of n, or A005361(n), is a function of the second signature of n (cf. A212172).  Since A181800 consists of the first integer of each second signature, this sequence gives the value of A005361 for each second signature in order of its first appearance.
%C A212647 a(n) also gives the number of divisors of A212638(n), a permutation of A025487.  Each positive integer n appears A001055(n) times in this sequence.

%F A212647 a(n) = A005361(A181800(n)).
%F A212647 a(n) = A000005(A212638(n)).
%e A212647 The product of the exponents in the prime factorization of 144 (2^4*3^2) is 4*2 = 8.  Since 144 = A181800(10), a(10) = 8.
