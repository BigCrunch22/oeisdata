%N A212654 LCM of the first few p-smooth numbers for a prime number p if in A007416; otherwise smallest number with same number of divisors (see example for details).
%C A212654 What is the smallest number in this sequence divisible by 27?
%e A212654 Term after 720 is 3600 because 720 is a 5-smooth number divisible by all 5-smooth numbers less than 25, and LCM of 720 and 25 is 3600.Term after 3600 is 5040 because 3600 is a 5-smooth number; divisible by all 5-smooth numbers less than 27, and LCM of 3600 and 27 is 10800, but 10800 has 60 divisors and smallest number with 60 divisors is 5040.
