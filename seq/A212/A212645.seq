%N A212645 a(n) = number of excess prime divisors of A181800(n) (n-th powerful number that is the first integer of its prime signature).
%C A212645 The excess of n, or A046660(n), is a function of the second signature of n (cf. A212172).  Since A181800 gives the first integer of each second signature, this sequence gives the value of A046660 for each second signature in order of its first appearance.  Each nonnegative integer n occurs A000041(n) times in the sequence.
%C A212645 a(n) is also the number of prime factors of A212638(n), counted with multiplicity.

%F A212645 a(n) = A046660(A181800(n)) = A212639(n)-A212179(n).
%F A212645 a(n) = A001222(A212638(n)).
%e A212645 36 (2^2*3^2, or 2*2*3*3) has 4 prime factors when repetitions are counted, but only 2 distinct prime factors.  Therefore, its "excess" as defined in A046660 is (4-2) = 2.  Since 36 = A181800(6), a(6) = 2.
%Y A212645 Cf. A046660, A181800, A212172, A212176, A212179, A212638, A212639, A212647.
