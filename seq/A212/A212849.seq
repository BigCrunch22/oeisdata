%N A212849 Numbers whose sum of prime factors (counted with multiplicity) is a triangular number.
%C A212849 This is to A212831 Numbers whose sum of prime factors is a square (counted with multiplicity) as A000290 squares are to A000217 triangular numbers.

%F A212849 {k such that A001414(k) = sopfr(k) is in A000217}.
%e A212849 sopfr(21) = sum of primes dividing 21 (with repetition) = 10, which is the  4th triangular number, so 21 is in this sequence.
%e A212849 The number 1 is here because the sum of its prime factors is 0, which is a triangular number.
