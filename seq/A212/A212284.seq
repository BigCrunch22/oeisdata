%N A212284 First a(n) > 1 whose sum of digits is the same in base 10 as in base n.
%C A212284 There might exist an n for which there is no solution, in which case a(n) would be set to 0 by convention; however, no such case was found so far. Problem: does it exist?

%e A212284 a(12)=108 because 108 is the first number > 1 such that when written in base 10 and in base 12 (i.e., 90), the sum of the expansion digits is the same, namely 9.
