%N A212643 Let b(n) and c(n) be the total numbers of distinct prime signatures and second signatures, respectively, represented among divisors of A181800(n) (first integers of each second signature; cf. A212172). b(n) mod c(n) = a(n).
%C A212643 Significance of the sequence:  Consider a member of A181800 with second signature {S} whose divisors represent a total of k distinct second signatures and a total of (j+k) distinct prime signatures. For all integers n with second signature {S}, A212180(n) = k and A085082(n) is congruent to j modulo k; see examples.
%C A212643 Note: b(n) = A212642(n); c(n) = A212644(n).

%F A212643 a(n) = A212642(n)-A212644(n), reduced modulo A212644(n).
%e A212643 4 is the smallest integer with second signature {2}, and its divisors represent 3 distinct prime signatures and 2 distinct second signatures. 1 = 3 mod 2. Since 4 = A181800(2), a(2) = 1. For all integers m with second signature {2}, A085082(m) is congruent to 1 modulo 2.
%e A212643 10800 is the smallest integer with second signature {4,3,2}, and its divisors represent 28 distinct prime signatures and 14 distinct second signatures. 0 = 28 mod 14.  Since 10800 = A181800(39), a(39) = 0. For all integers m with second signature {4,3,2}, A085082(m) is congruent to 0 modulo 14.
