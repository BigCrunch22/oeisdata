%N A212155 Digits of one of the three 7-adic integers (-1)^(1/3).
%C A212155 See A210853 for comments and an approximation to this 7-adic number, called there v.  See also A048898 for references on p-adic numbers.
%C A212155 a(n), n>=1, is the (unique) solution of the linear congruence 3 * b(n)^2 * a(n) + c(n) == 0 (mod 7), with  b(n):=A212153(n) and c(n):=A212154(n). a(0) = 5, one of the three solutions of X^3+1 == 0 (mod 7).
%C A212155 Since b(n) == 5 (mod 7), a(n) == 4 * c(n) (mod 7) for n>0. - _Álvar Ibeas_, Feb 20 2017
%C A212155 With a(0) = 4, this is the digits of one of the three cube root of 1, the one that is congruent to 4 modulo 7. - _Jianing Song_, Aug 26 2022
%F A212155 a(n) = (b(n+1) - b(n))/7^n, n>=1, with b(n):=A212153(n), defined by a recurrence given there. One also finds there a Maple program for b(n). a(0)=5.
%F A212155 a(n) = 6 - A212152(n), for n>0. - _Álvar Ibeas_, Feb 21 2017
