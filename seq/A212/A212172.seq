%N A212172 Row n of table represents second signature of n: list of exponents >= 2 in canonical prime factorization of n, in nonincreasing order, or 0 if no such exponent exists.
%C A212172 Length of row n equals A056170(n) if A056170(n) is positive, or 1 if A056170(n) = 0.
%C A212172 The multiset of exponents >=2 in the prime factorization of n completely determines a(n) for over 20 sequences in the database (see crossreferences). It also determines the fractions A034444(n)/A000005(n) and A037445(n)/A000005(n).
%C A212172 For squarefree numbers, this multiset is { } (the empty multiset). The use of 0 in the table to represent each n with no exponents >=2 in its prime factorization accords with the usual OEIS practice of using 0 to represent nonexistent elements when possible. In comments, the second signature of squarefree numbers will be represented as { }.
%C A212172 For each second signature {S}, there exist values of j and k such that, if the second signature of n is {S}, then A085082(n) is congruent to j modulo k.  These values are nontrivial unless {S} = { }. Analogous (but not necessarily identical) values of j and k also exist for each second signature with respect to A088873 and A181796.
%C A212172 Each sequence of integers with a given second signature {S} has a positive density, unlike the analogous sequences for prime signatures. The highest of these densities is 6/Pi^2 = 0.607927... for A005117 ({S} = { }).

%F A212172 For nonsquarefree n, row n is identical to row A057521(n) of table A212171.
%e A212172 First rows of table read: 0; 0; 0; 2; 0; 0; 0; 3; 2; 0; 0; 2;...
%e A212172 12 = 2^2*3 has positive exponents 2 and 1 in its canonical prime factorization (1s are often left implicit as exponents). Since only exponents that are 2 or greater appear in a number's second signature, 12's second signature is {2}.
%e A212172 30 = 2*3*5 has no exponents greater than 1 in its prime factorization. The multiset of its exponents >= 2 is { } (the empty multiset), represented in the table with a 0.
%e A212172 72 = 2^3*3^2 has positive exponents 3 and 2 in its prime factorization, as does 108 = 2^2*3^3. Rows 72 and 108 both read {3,2}.
