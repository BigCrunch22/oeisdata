%C A212126 a(1)-a(42) coincide with A085242.
%C A212126 Consider the sequence in which a(n) = 1 if two rhombuses that are adjacent to one of the six spokes of the E-toothpick (or snowflake) structure of A161330 appear at n-th stage, otherwise 0. Is this the same as the mentioned sequence? If not, where is the first place these sequences differ? - _Omar E. Pol_, Feb 28 2013
