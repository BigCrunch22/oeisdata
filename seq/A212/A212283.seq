%N A212283 First a(n) > 1 whose sum of digits is the same in base 2 as in base n.
%C A212283 Theoretically, there might exist an n for which there is no solution, in which case a(n) would be set to 0 by convention; however, no such case was found so far. Problem: does it exist?

%e A212283 Example: a(13) = 172 because 172 is the first number >1 such that its expansions in base 2 (10101100) and in base 13 (103) have the same sum of digits, namely 4.
