%N A212641 Largest odd divisor of A212640(n) (number of divisors of n-th powerful number that is the first integer of its prime signature).
%C A212641 The odd part of d(n), or largest odd divisor of d(n) (A212181(n)), is a function of the second signature of n (cf. A212172).  Since A181800 gives the first integer of each second signature, this sequence gives the value of A212181 for each second signature in order of its first appearance.
%C A212641 Note: The odd part of d(n) is not the same as the number of odd divisors of n (A001227(n)).
%C A212641 Each odd integer appears an infinite number of times.

%F A212641 a(n) = A000265(A212640(n)) = A212181(A181800(n)).
%e A212641 A181800(5) = 32 has 6 divisors (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32).  The largest odd divisor of 6 is 3. Hence, a(5) = 3.
%Y A212641 Cf. A000005, A000265, A181800, A212172, A212181, A212640.
