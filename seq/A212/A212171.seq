%N A212171 Prime signature of n (nonincreasing version): row n of table lists positive exponents in canonical prime factorization of n, in nonincreasing order.
%C A212171 Length of row n equals A001221(n).
%C A212171 The multiset of positive exponents in n's prime factorization completely determines a(n) for a host of OEIS sequences, including several "core" sequences.  Of those not cross-referenced here or in A212172, many can be found by searching the database for A025487.
%C A212171 (Note: Differing opinions may exist about whether the prime signature of n should be defined as this multiset itself, or as a symbol or collection of symbols that identify or "signify" this multiset. The definition of this sequence is designed to be compatible with either view, as are the original comments. When n >= 2, the customary ways to signify the multiset of exponents in n's prime factorization are to list the constituent exponents in either nonincreasing or nondecreasing order; this table gives the nonincreasing version.)
%C A212171 Table lists exponents in the order in which they appear in the prime factorization of a member of A025487.  This ordering is common in database comments (e.g., A008966).
%C A212171 Each possible multiset of an integer's positive prime factorization exponents corresponds to a unique partition that contains the same elements (cf. A000041). This includes the multiset of 1's positive exponents, { } (the empty multiset), which corresponds to the partition of 0.
%C A212171 Differs from A124010 from a(23) on, corresponding to the factorization of 18 = 2^1*3^2 which is here listed as row 18 = [2, 1], but as [1, 2] (in the order of the prime factors) in A124010 and also in A118914 which lists the prime signatures in nondecreasing order (so that row 12 = 2^2*3^1 is also [1, 2]). - _M.

%F A212171 Row n of A118914, reversed.
%F A212171 Row n of A124010 for n > 1, with exponents sorted in nonincreasing order. Equivalently, row A046523(n) of A124010 for n > 1.

%e A212171 The multiset of positive exponents in the prime factorization of 6 = 2*3 is {1,1} (1s are often left implicit as exponents). The prime signature of 6 is therefore {1,1}.
%e A212171 12 = 2^2*3 has positive exponents 2 and 1 in its prime factorization, as does 18 = 2*3^2. Rows 12 and 18 of the table both read {2,1}.

%Y A212171 Cf. A025487, A001221 (row lengths), A001222 (row sums). A118914 gives the nondecreasing version. A124010 lists exponents in n's prime factorization in natural order, with A124010(1) = 0.
