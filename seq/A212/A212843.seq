%N A212843 Carmichael numbers that have only prime divisors of the form 10k+1.
%C A212843 Conjecture: only Carmichael numbers of the form 10n+1 can have prime divisors of the form 10k+1 (but not all Carmichael numbers of the form 10n+1 have prime divisors of the form 10k+1).
%C A212843 Checked up to Carmichael number 4954039956700380001.
%C A212843 Conjecture: all Carmichael numbers C (not only with three prime divisors) of the form 10n+1 that have only prime divisors of the form 10k+1 can be written as C = (30a+1)*(30b+1)*(30c+1), C = (30a+11)*(30b+11)*(30c+11), or C = (30a+1)*(30b+11)*(30c+11). In other words, there are no numbers of the form C = (30a+1)*(30b+1)*(30c+11).
%C A212843 Checked for all Carmichael numbers from the sequence above.
%C A212843 The first conjecture is a consequence of Korselt's criterion. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Oct 02 2012
