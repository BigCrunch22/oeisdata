%N A212420 Known primes such that there are no pairwise coprime solutions to the Diophantine equation of the form x^3 + y^3 = p^a z^n with a >= 1 an integer and n >= p^(2p) prime.
%C A212420 These primes are the prime numbers p greater than 3 such that for every elliptic curves with conductor of the form 18p, 36p, or 72p we have that 4 does not divide the order of the torsion subgroup over the rationals but at least one curve with 2 dividing this order, such that there is a prime q congruent to 1 modulo 6 such that 4 does not divide the order of the torsion subgroup over the finite field of size q.
