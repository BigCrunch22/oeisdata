%N A185445 Smallest number having exactly t divisors, where t is the n-th triprime (A014612).
%C A185445 This is the 3rd row of an infinite array A[k,n] = smallest number having exactly j divisors where j is the n-th natural number with exactly k prime factors (with multiplicity).
%C A185445 The first row is A061286, the second row is A096932.
%F A185445 a(n) = A005179(A014612(n)).
%e A185445 a(10) is 3600 because the 10th triprime is 45, and the smallest number with exactly 45 factors is 3600 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5^2.
%e A185445 a(20) is 62914560 because the 10th triprime is 92, and the smallest number with exactly 92 factors is 62914560 = 2^22 * 3 * 5.
%Y A185445 Cf. A005179, A014612, A061286, A096932.
