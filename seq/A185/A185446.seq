%F A185446 a(n) = A185447(2^n-1) > prime(n).
%e A185446 For n=1, the least prime P such that 2P cannot be written as the sum of two primes of which at least one is <= prime(1)=2, is obviously P=3.
%e A185446 For n=2, we have a(2)=19, which is such that 2*19 can be written as the sum of primes only as 7+31 and 19+19, where no prime <= prime(2)=3 occurs. For smaller primes we have 2*17=3+31, 2*13=3+23, 2*11=3+19, 2*7=3+11, 2*5=3+5 (always using 3=prime(2)), and of course 3 and 2 are excluded, too.
