%N A185973 Array of divisor product arguments appearing in the denominator of the unique representation of primorials A002110 in terms of divisor products.
%C A185973 The corresponding array for the numerators is given as A185972(n,m).
%C A185973 The sequence of row lengths of this array is 2^{n-1}=A000079(n-1), n>=1.
%C A185973 The array a(n,m), m=1..2^{n-1}, n>=1, is to be read as an ordered list of numbers which give the arguments for the divisor products, called dp(). E.g., in row n=2: [3,2] stands for the ordered product
%C A185973   dp(3) dp(2). Only after evaluation dp(k) becomes A007955(k).
%C A185973 Every natural number has a unique representation in terms of divisor products dp( ) which become after evaluation A007955(k). This representation is called dpr(n). The one for the primorials n=A002110(N), N>=1, is fundamental.

%F A185973 a(n,m), together with A185972(n,m), is found using proposition 1 of a paper by W. Lang, given as link in A185972. In this proposition p_j has, for the application here, to be replaced by the j-th prime p(j):=A000040(j), and a() there is dp() here.

%e A185973 The numerator/denominator structure begins
%e A185973 [2]/[1]; [6, 1]/[3, 2]; [30, 5, 3, 2]/[15, 10, 6, 1], [210, 35, 21, 15, 14, 10, 6, 1]/[105, 70, 42, 30, 7, 5, 3, 2],...
%e A185973 n=3: A002110(3)=30 has the unique representation symbolized by  [30, 5, 3, 2]/[15, 10, 6, 1] which is
%e A185973   dp(30) dp(5) dp(3) dp(2)/dp(15) dp(10) dp(6) dp(1). Note that dp(1),although it evaluates to 1 has to be kept in the representation. This checks:  (30*15*10*6*5*3*2*1)*(5*1)*(3*1)*(2*1)/
%e A185973   ((15*5*3*1)*(10*5*2*1)*(6*3*2*1)*(1)) = 30.
