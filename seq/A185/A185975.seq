%N A185975 Prime number factorization of n mapped to a(n)-th partition in A-St order.
%C A185975 This is the inverse of the map n->A185974(n), n>=1.
%C A185975 The prime number factorization
%C A185975   n = p(1)^e(1)*p(2)^e(2)*...*p(M)^e(M), with e(M)>=1, and e(j)>=0, j=1,..,M-1, with the prime numbers p(j):=A000040(j), is mapped to the partition 1^e(1),2^e(2),...,M^e(M), with M=M(n) = A061395(n). Note that j^0 means that j does not show up in the partition, it is not 1. a(n) is the position of this partition of N=N(n):=sum(j*e(j), j=1..M(n))  in the A-St (Abramowitz-Stegun) list of all partitions. See A036036 and the reference for this order.
%C A185975 In order to obtain an exponent list of length N=N(n), appropriate for a partition of N(n), one has to append N(n)-M(n)>=0 zeros to the list [e(1),e(2),...,e(M(n))].
%C A185975   E.g., n=10, M(10)=3, N(10)=4, from the partition 1^2,3^1; N(10)-M(10)= 1, hence the complete exponent list for this partition is [2,0,1,0].
%C A185975 In order to have offset 1 one could add a(1):=0.

%F A185975 a(n) gives the a(n)-th position of the partition in A-St order (see A036036 and the reference) obtained from the prime number factorization of n read as partition. This mapping is explained in the comment above.
%e A185975 a(20)=15 because 20=p(1)^2 p(3)^1 which maps to the partition 1^2,3^1 (of N(20)=5) which appears at position 15 in the A-St list. M(20)=3, hence the exponent list for this partition is [2,0,1,0,0] (2=5-3 zeros added to the list [2,0,1] from the prime number factorization exponent list).
