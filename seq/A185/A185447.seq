%N A185447 Least prime such that whenever 2*a(n) is the sum of two primes, none of them is in the set F such that Sum_{p in F} 2^primepi(p-1) = n.
%C A185447 The set F=F(n) of primes corresponding to a(n) is such that its characteristic function, within the set of primes, is the binary expansion of n: F={ prime(i[1]),...,prime(i[m]) } <=> n = 2^(i[1]-1) + ... + 2^(i[m]-1). Otherwise said, the set F is the set of prime factors of A019565(n) = Product_(prime(i)^bittest(n,i-1)).

%F A185447 a(2k) = 2; a(4k-3) = 3; a(2^k-1) = A185446(n) > prime(n).
%e A185447 For n=3, we look for the least prime P which cannot be written as sum of two primes involving prime(1)=2 or prime(2)=3 (since n=3=2^0+2^1). See A185446 for details about a(3)=19.
%e A185447 If n is even, this means the set F does not contain 2, and therefore a(n)=2 since 2*2 can only be written as 2+2, using primes not in F.
%e A185447 If n=4k-3, its binary expansion ends in ...01, i.e., the set F does contain prime(1)=2, but not prime(2)=3. Therefore a(n)=3, since 2*3 can only be written as 3+3, using primes not in F.
