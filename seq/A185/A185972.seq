%N A185972 Array of divisor product arguments appearing in the numerator of the unique representation of primorials A002110 in terms of divisor products.
%C A185972 The corresponding array for the denominators is given as A185973(n,m).
%C A185972 The row lengths of this array are 2^(n-1), n>=1.
%C A185972 The array a(n,m), m=1..2^{n-1}, n>=1, is an ordered list of numbers which give the arguments for the divisor products, called dp(). E.g., in the row n=2, [6,1] represents the ordered product dp(6)*dp(1).
%C A185972   Only after evaluation, dp(k) becomes A007955(k).
%C A185972 Every natural number has a unique representation in terms of products of divisors dp() which become after evaluation A007955(k). This representation is called dpr(n). The one for the primorials n=A002110(N), N>=1, is fundamental.
%C A185972   See the W. Lang link found also under A007955.

%F A185972 a(n,m), together with A185973(n,m), is found using proposition 1 of a paper by W. Lang, given as link above. In this proposition p_j has, for this application, to be replaced by the j-th prime p(j)=A000040(j), and a() there is dp() here.

%e A185972 The numerator/denominator structure begins

%e A185972 n=1: A002110(1)=2 has the unique representation  dp(2)/dp(1), with dp(k) the product of divisors of k. This checks when evaluated: (2*1)/(1) = 2.
%e A185972   Note that dp(k) should not be replaced by its value A007955(k) in the representations, only in the check.
%e A185972 n=2: A002110(2)=6 has the unique representation dp(6)*dp(2)/(dp(3)*dp(2)) which checks: (6*3*2*1)*(2*1)/((3*1)*(2*1)) = 6.
