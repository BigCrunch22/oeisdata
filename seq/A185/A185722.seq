%N A185722 Triangle read by rows: The number of m-path covers of the n-cycle C_n.
%C A185722 Let c_m(n) be the number of m-path covers of the n-cycle C_n. Then form the triangle where c_m(n) is the (n,m) entry. This sequence is this triangle when read by rows, for n >= 1 and 1 <= m <= n.

%e A185722 An m-path cover of a graph G is a covering of the vertices of G by paths of length at most m.
%e A185722 The length of a path is the number of vertices in it. Let C_4 have vertices {1, 2, 3, 4} then c_3(4) = 11 because C_4 has 11 3-path covers: 1, 2, 3, 4; 12, 3, 4; 23, 1, 4; 34, 1, 2; 14, 2, 3; 12, 34; 14, 23; 123, 4; 234, 1; 143, 2; 214, 3. Here an m-path and its reverse are considered to be the same m-path.
%e A185722 If we include the starting conditions c_m(i) = 2^i - 1, 1 <= i <= m, we get the following square:

%Y A185722 The (n, m) entry of the triangle formed from sequence A126198 counts the compositions of the integer n in which each part is at most m. In our terminology this is the number of m-path covers of the path P_n with n vertices. The (m, m) term in the triangle formed from sequence A126198 is 2^(m - 1), in our triangle above the (m, m) term is 2^m - 1. Column m of the corresponding square of sequence A126198 also obeys an m-anacci recurrence, as above. Each of the 10 columns of the above square array appears as a sequence: for example, the second column (m = 2) is sequence A000204, and the third column (m = 3) is sequence A001644, etc.
