%N A185441 Records in A185439; record gaps between consecutive emirps.
%C A185441 This is to A005250 (increasing gaps between primes) as A006567 (emirps) are to A000040 (primes). Lower number of record emirp difference pair (emirp analog of A002386): 13, 17, 37, 113, 389, 1979, 3929.
%e A185441 a(8) = 148th emirp - 147th emirp =  7027 - 3929 = 3098, given that R(7027) = 7207 is prime and R(3929) = 9293 is prime.
%Y A185441 Cf. A000040, A000101, A001223, A002386, A004086, A006567.
