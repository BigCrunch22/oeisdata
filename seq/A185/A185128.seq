%C A185128 Comments from _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 28 2024 (Start):
%C A185128 Beiler's Table 81 (see link) lists eight sequences based on finding pairs of triangular numbers whose sum and difference are also triangular numbers. The sequences are A185128 (the present sequence), A185129, A185223, A185233, A185243, A185253, A185257, and A185258.
%C A185128 The order of the pairs is the same in each sequence, and is determined by the terms of the present sequence.
%C A185128 It would be nice to have an analytic solution to the corresponding Diophantine equations. Beiler does not discuss this, but it is probably in Volume 2 of Dickson's "History of the Theory of Numbers".

%e A185128 a(2) = 171, since the pair of triangular numbers 171 = 18*(18+1)/2 and 105 = 14*(14+1)/2 produce the sum 276 = 23*(23+1)/2 and the difference 66 = 11*(11+1)/2 which are both triangular numbers.
