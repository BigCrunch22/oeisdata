%N A185166 Number of prime divisors of n (counted with multiplicity) of numbers k such that sum of proper divisors of k exceeds that of all smaller numbers.
%H A185166 Amiram Eldar, <a href="/A185166/b185166.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..1000</a> (calculated from the b-file at A034090)
%F A185166 a(n) = A001222(A034090(n)).
%e A185166 a(1) = 0 because 1 = A034090(1) has no prime factors.
%e A185166 a(2) = 1 because 2 = A034090(2) has one prime factor, itself.
%e A185166 a(3) = 2 because 4 = A034090(3) = 2^2 has two prime factors (with multiplicity).
