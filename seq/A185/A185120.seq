%N A185120 Cut decimal expansion of e (A001113) into pieces that are primes, each prime being greater in length than the last.
%C A185120 Feb 06 2012: _Charles R Greathouse IV_ found the next few terms. He reports that the sequence starts 2, 71, 8281828459045235360287471, 352...3059 (90 digits), 9218...939 (456 digits), 239...6753 (608 digits), 985...8631 (1421 digits), 382...0327 (1469 digits). Since these terms are too large to display here, M. F. Hasler points out that we could add a sequence giving the starting place (in the decimal expansion of e) where the next prime begins.
%C A185120 If we omit the condition that the terms increase in length, the sequence begins 2, 7. The third term is the 649-digit number 18281...0429, found by _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Feb 06 2012.
