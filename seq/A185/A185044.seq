%N A185044 Number of disconnected 4-regular simple graphs on n vertices with girth exactly 4.
%C A185044 Only one component need have girth exactly four; the other components need only have girth at least four.
%C A185044 First differs from A185244 at n = 38, the smallest n where A185245 is nonzero.
