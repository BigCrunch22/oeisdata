%N A185001 Numbers k with the property that their basins (as defined in A204539) are 2.
%C A185001 This sequence follows on from A204540, which lists seven values of k for which basin(k) = 1. There are 37 known values of k for which basin(k) = 2. A search of numbers up to 10,000,000 has not uncovered any further integers with this property. The possibility that there are even larger numbers with basins equal to 2 cannot be completely ruled out, but the chances of one being discovered are remote, in view of the fact that the average basin size for large values of k is approximately k/3, that is, over 2000000 in the region where the last known such integer was discovered.
%C A185001 For unknown reasons, all integers > 5 with basins equal to 1 or 2 are even.
