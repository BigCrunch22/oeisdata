%N A185456 Payphone packing sequence.
%C A185456 Assume that the first person to use a bank of payphones selects one at the end, and all subsequent users select the phone which puts them farthest from the current phone users. U(n) is the smallest number of phones such that n may be used without any two adjacent phones being used.
%F A185456 a(n) is the index of the n-th record in A166079, which is given by the recurrence y(n) = y(m) + y(n-m+1) - 1, with y(1) = y(2) = 1 and y(3) = 2, where m = ceiling(n/2). - _John W. Layman_, Feb 05 2011
%F A185456 From _Nathaniel Johnston_, Apr 12 2011: (Start)
%F A185456 a(n) = a(n-1) + n - 1 if n = 2^k + 2 for some natural number k, a(n) = a(n-1) + 1 otherwise, for n >= 3.
%F A185456 a(n) = n + 2^(1+floor(log_2(n-2))) for n >= 3. (End)
%e A185456 For 4 phones, only the outer two will be used. For a fifth phone, however, a third person may come along and use the middle phone without any two being adjacent; thus U(3)=5. A seventh phone will not lead to a fourth being used without adjacent people, but an eighth will, hence U(4)=8.
