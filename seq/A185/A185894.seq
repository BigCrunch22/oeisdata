%N A185894 Number of prime divisors (counted with multiplicity) of number of rings with n elements.
%C A185894 By convention, there is 1 ring with no elements. The first value that I don't know is a(32), where the number of rings with 32 elements was said by Christof Noebauer in 2000 to be > 18590. The next value not known to me is a(64), which is where the same source gives the number of rings with 64 elements > 829826. The articles by Christof Noebauer are linked to from A027623.

%F A185894 a(n) = A001222(A027623(n)).
%e A185894 a(16) = 4 because there are A027623(16) = 390 rings with 16 elements, and 390 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 13 has 4 prime divisors counted with multiplicity (in this example, each has multiplicity of 1).
%Y A185894 Cf. A001222, A027623.
