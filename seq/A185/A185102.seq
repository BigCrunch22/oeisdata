%N A185102 a(n) is the recursion depth of repeatedly factoring n and then the exponents in its prime product factorization, until 1 is reached.
%C A185102 a(n) is the depth of a tree whose root is n and whose construction follows the rule: The children of n are the exponents in its prime factorization. If the number is 1, the convention is taken that the prime factorization is empty, and hence the set of children of 1 is the null set. The formulaic sequence definition given uses pattern matching on n as a product of primes, which is always possible by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. The max{...} notation refers to the maximum value of the specified set.
%C A185102 The sequence differs from A096309 only at a(1) = 0. The justification for this choice is that the null product of primes has 0 levels.
%C A185102 For all numbers i less than or equal to 2^^x, i.e., 2 tetrated to the x, a(i) < x. Tetration is the next hyperoperation after exponentiation, and can be defined: x^^0 = 1 and x^^y = x^(x^^(y - 1)). Due to this bound the sequence can be seen to grow very slowly.
