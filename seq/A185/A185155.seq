%N A185155 Irregular triangle read by rows: Catalan coefficients T(n,k), n>=0, 0 <= k <= C_n, where C_n = A000108(n).
%C A185155 Let k = number of splits -- Think of the first split as a bisection of our space, say the unit interval, the second split can be either bisecting the left half or the right half from the first split, etc. Alternatively, think of a "spatial binary branching process" or plane trees.
%C A185155 Let C_k = number of distinct space-partitioning binary trees made from k splits (the Catalan number).
%C A185155 k! = number of ways in which we can reach any of the distinct space-partitioning binary trees attained by k splits, i.e., the total number of distinct paths in the Hasse Diagram representing the split-based transition diagram that is representing the growth of such space-partitioning binary trees.
%C A185155 "Catalan Coefficients" is the number of distinct paths from the unique root tree with 0 splits to each one of the C_k many distinct trees with k splits that are structurally labeled with elements from [C_k] := {0,1,2,...,C_k-1}. Let these distinct path counts from the root tree be our coefficients B_k := (B_{k,0},B_{k,1},...,B_{k,C_k-1}). Note that this recursion for B_k depends on B_{k-1}, i.e., the number of distinct paths from the root tree with 0 splits to each distinct tree j in [C_{k-1}] with k-1 splits and the subset A_i of [C_{k-1}] of trees with k-1 splits that can produce the tree i in [C_k] with k splits.  Thus B_k = ( B_{k,0},B_{k,1},...,B_{k,C_k-1} ), B_{k,i} = sum_{j in A_i} B_{k-1,j}, sum_{i=0..C_k-1}B_{k,i}=k!
%C A185155 The following B_k for k in {0,1,2,3,4,5} were hand-computed by Gloria Teng on Aug 21 2009 and verified by Raazesh Sainudiin.
