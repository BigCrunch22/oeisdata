%N A338924 Every prime term k of the sequence is the cumulative sum of the prime digits used so far (the digits of k are included in the sum).
%C A338924 This is the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms with this property. The prime digits are 2, 3, 5 and 7.

%e A338924 a(1) = 1 as 1 (a nonprime term) is the smallest term not yet present in the sequence that doesn't lead to a contradiction;
%e A338924 a(2) = 2 as 2 (a prime term) is the sum of all prime digits used so far;
%e A338924 a(3) = 4 (a nonprime term) as a(3) = 3 (a prime) would be a contradiction and a(3) = 4 doesn't lead to a contradiction;
%e A338924 ...
%e A338924 a(14) = 11 (a prime term) as 11 is the sum of all prime digits used so far (2 + 2 + 5 + 2);
%e A338924 a(15) = 21 (a nonprime term) as 21 is the smallest term not yet present in the sequence that doesn't lead to a contradiction;

%e A338924 a(18) = 19 (a prime term) as 19 is the sum of all prime digits used so far (2 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2); etc.
