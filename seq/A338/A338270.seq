%N A338270 Primes p such that the sum of p and the average of the primes immediately before and after p is prime.
%C A338270 At least one of the prime gaps before and after a(n) is divisible by 6, and exactly one is divisible by 4.
%C A338270 Dickson's conjecture implies there are, for example, infinitely many primes p such that p-4 is the prime before p, p+6 is the prime after p, and 2*p+1 is prime; these are members of the sequence.
%C A338270 For the sum of a(n) and the average of the primes immediately before and after a(n) see A338273.
%C A338270 a(3)=79, a(4)=83, a(5)=89 are three consecutive primes.  The first case of four consecutive primes in the sequence is a(723)=67789, a(724)=67801, a(725)=67807, a(726)=67819.  The first case of five consecutive primes in the sequence is a(13175)=2263249, a(13176)=2263273, a(13177)=2263307, a(13178)=2263319, a(13179)=2263321.

%e A338270 a(3)=79 is in the sequence because 79 is prime, the primes before and after 79 are 73 and 83, and 79 + (73+83)/2 = 157 is prime.
