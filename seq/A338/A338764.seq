%N A338764 Let L_1 = (1, 2, ...); for any n > 0, let M_n = Min_{k > 0} L_n(k) + L_n(k+1) and K_n = Min_{ k | L_n(k) + L_n(k+1) = M_n }, L_{n+1} is obtained by replacing the two terms L_n(K_n) and L_n(K_n+1) by M_n in L_n; a(n) = K_n.
%C A338764 In other words, we start with the natural numbers and repeatedly replace the leftmost pair of consecutive terms with minimal sum by its sum; a(n) corresponds to the position of the pair substituted at n-th step.
