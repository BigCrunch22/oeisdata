%N A338052 a(n) = A337645(n-1) - n.
%C A338052 Motivation: This is (smallest missing legal number in A336967) - n. For when we are trying to find A336957(n), the smallest legal possibility is A337645(n-1), which appears to grow like n.
%C A338052 However, the conclusion from looking at the graph of the present sequence is that A337645(n) ~ n*(1 - 1/50) or perhaps n*(1 - c/log n) would be a better approximation to A337645.
