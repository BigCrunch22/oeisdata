%N A338580 Numerators of resistance values that can be obtained from a network of exactly 10 one-ohm resistors, but not from any network with fewer than 10 one-ohm resistors. Denominators are in A338590.
%C A338580 The A338197(k)/2 initial terms of this sequence are also the numerators of the corresponding sorted lists of resistance values that can be achieved by exactly k resistors for all k < 10.
