%N A338611 Numbers all of whose divisors, excluding the divisor 1, are evil numbers (A001969) with a record number of divisors.
%C A338611 A number m is in this sequence if it is in A093688, and d(m) > d(k) for all terms k < m in A093688, where d(m) is the number of divisors of m (A000005).
%C A338611 The corresponding record numbers of divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, ...
%C A338611 Apparently, all the terms except for 1 are products of powers of Fermat primes (A019434). 3 seems to be the only prime with multiplicity larger than 1 in some of the terms. There are no other terms in this sequence that are products of powers of the 5 known Fermat primes.
%e A338611 The first 4 terms of A093688 are 1, 3, 5, 9, and their numbers of divisors are 1, 2, 2, 3. The record values 1, 2 and 3 occur at 1, 3 and 9 that are the first 3 terms of this sequence.
