%N A338914 Number of integer partitions of n of even length whose greatest multiplicity is at most half their length.
%C A338914 These are also integer partitions that can be partitioned into not necessarily distinct edges (pairs of distinct parts). For example, (3,3,2,2) can be partitioned as {{2,3},{2,3}}, so is counted under a(10), but (4,2,2,2) and (4,2,1,1,1,1) cannot be partitioned into edges. The multiplicities of such a partition form a multigraphical partition (A209816, A320924).
