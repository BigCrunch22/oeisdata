%N A338303 Decimal expansion of Sum_{k>=0} 1/(L(2*k) + 2), where L(k) is the k-th Lucas number (A000032).
%C A338303 Backstrom (1981) found that the sum is approximately equal to 1/8 + 1/(4*log(phi)), where phi is the golden ratio (A001622). The difference is less than 1/10^7. He called this difference "a tantalizing problem".
%C A338303 Almkvist (1986) added a term to Backstrom's formula to get an even better approximation which differs from the exact value by less than 1/10^33: 1/8 + 1/(4*log(phi)) + Pi^2/(log(phi)^2 * (exp(Pi^2/log(phi)) - 2)). He found an exact formula from a quotient of two Jacobi theta functions (see the FORMULA section), and showed that both approximations are just the first terms in a rapidly converging series.
%C A338303 Since exp(-Pi^2/log(phi)) = 1.23...*10^(-9) is small, the convergence is rapid: the number of terms needed in each of the two series in the formula to get 10^2, 10^3 and 10^4 decimal digits are merely 3, 10 and 32, respectively.
%C A338303 Andre-Jeannin (1991) noted that if the summand 2 that is added to the Lucas numbers is replaced with sqrt(5), then the sum is Sum_{k>=0} 1/(L(2*k) + sqrt(5)) = 1/phi (A094214).
