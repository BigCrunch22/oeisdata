%N A338742 When a(n) is even, a(n) is the number of even digits present so far in the sequence, a(n) included.
%C A338742 The odd nonnegative integers are present in their natural order. Some even natural integers will never appear.
%e A338742 The first even term is a(12) = 2 and there are indeed 2 even digits so far in the sequence (the 2 from 21 and 2 itself);
%e A338742 The next even term is a(14) = 4 and there are now 4 even digits so far (2, 2, 2 and 4);
%e A338742 The next even term is a(16) = 6 and there are now 6 even digits so far (2, 2, 2, 4, 2 and 6); etc.
