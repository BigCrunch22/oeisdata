%N A338023 Primes q for which in the q-cyclotomic field the 2-dimension of the group of circular units over the group of totally positive circular units is not maximal.
%C A338023 Equivalently those primes q for which not every totally positive circular unit of the q-cyclotomic field is the square of a circular unit.
