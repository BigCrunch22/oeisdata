%N A338535 a(n) is the smallest number k for which the width n at the diagonal equals the maximum width of the symmetric representation of sigma(k).
%C A338535 All numbers computed so far for this sequence have a symmetric representation of sigma that consists of a single region.
%C A338535 Additional values computed through 2000000 are a(20,21,22,24,26,30) = (277200, 1411200, 360360, 960960, 942480, 1884960).
%e A338535 a(3) = 72 = 2^3*3^2 is in the sequence since it is the smallest with maximum width 3 and width 3 at the diagonal for its symmetric representation of sigma. Number 60 is the smallest number with maximum width 3, but it has width 2 at the diagonal (see also Ax22222). a(3) has the following pattern for the widths of the legs up to the diagonal (see A249223): 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3 for its single region.
%e A338535 a(5) = 3528 = 2^3*3^2*7^2 is in the sequence, but does not have a monotone increase of widths up to the diagonal in its single region: 1...2...3...4...3...4...3...4...5 (there are 83 legs to the diagonal).
