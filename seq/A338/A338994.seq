%N A338994 Table read by antidiagonals: if x(n+1) = A001414(x(n-1)) + A001414(x(n)) with x(0) = i and x(1) = j, then T(i,j) is the first k such that (x(k), x(k+1)) is a fixed point or a member of a cycle.  If there is no such k, then T(i,j) = -1.
%C A338994 The fixed points are (0,0) and (16,16) (i.e., if x(0)=16 and x(1)=16 then all x(n)=16).  Cycles include (23, 32, 33, 24), (19, 28, 30, 21, 20), and (23, 34, 42, 31, 43, 74, 82, 82, 86, 88, 62, 50, 45).
%C A338994 Are there other cycles?  Is T(i,j) ever -1?  For 1 <= i <= 3000 and 1 <= j <= 3000, T(i,j) is never -1 and no other cycles are encountered.
