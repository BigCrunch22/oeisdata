%N A338783 Number of polyhedra formed when an n-prism, formed from two n-sided regular polygons joined by n adjacent rectangles, is internally cut by all the planes defined by any three of its vertices.
%C A338783 For an n-prism, formed from two n-sided regular polygons joined by n adjacent rectangles, create all possible internal planes defined by connecting any three of its vertices. For example, in the case of a triangular prism this results in 6 planes. Use all the resulting planes to cut the prism into individual smaller polyhedra. The sequence lists the number of resulting polyhedra for prisms with n>=3.
%C A338783 See A338801 for the number and images of the k-faced polyhedra in each prism dissection.

%e A338783 a(3) = 18. The triangular 3-prism has 6 internal cutting planes resulting in 18 polyhedra; seventeen 4-faced polyhedra and one 6-faced polyhedron.
%e A338783 a(4) = 96. The square 4-prism (a cuboid) has 14 internal cutting planes resulting in 96 polyhedra; seventy-two 4-faced polyhedra and twenty-four 5-faced polyhedra. See A338622.
