%N A338660 Number of circle graphs of Gauss diagrams of meander curves with 2n+1 crossings.
%C A338660 See A343358 for a definition of a graph corresponding to a closed planar curve. Meanders have been defined in various ways; for the purpose of considering their Gauss diagrams and graphs, a meander is understood as a closed planar curve in whose graph there is a vertex adjacent to every other vertex. This sequence is the number of distinct graphs of meanders of (necessarily odd) sizes.
