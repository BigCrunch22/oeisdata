%N A338265 If a(n) has at least one common digit with a(n-1), underline a(n). The non-underlined terms reproduce the sequence itself.
%C A338265 This is a kind of fractal sequence as it contains an infinite number of copies of itself. The underlined terms of the sequence are the lexicographically earliest permutation of the natural numbers > 10.
%e A338265 If we erase the parenthesized terms, we get the sequence itself: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 20), 11, (31, 23, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 32, 30), 12, (41, 34, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 43, 40), 13, (51, 45, 42, 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 54, 50), 14, (61, 56, 52, 53, 55, 57, 58, 59, 65, 60), 15, (71, 67, 62, 63, 64, 66, 68, 69, 76, 70), 16, (81, 78, 72, ...) etc.
