%N A338744 When a(n) is even, a(n) is the number of odd digits present so far in the sequence, a(n) included.
%C A338744 The odd nonnegative integers are present in their natural order. Some even natural integers will never appear (6 for instance).
%e A338744 The first even term is a(1) = 0 and there is indeed 0 odd digit so far in the sequence;
%e A338744 The next even term is a(4) = 2 and there are now 2 odd digits so far (1 and 3);
%e A338744 The next even term is a(7) = 4 and there are now 4 odd digits so far (1, 3, 5 and 7);
%e A338744 ...
%e A338744 The even term a(11) = 10 and there are indeed 10 odd digits in the sequence so far (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, 1, 1, 3 and 1); etc.
