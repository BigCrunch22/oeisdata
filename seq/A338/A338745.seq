%N A338745 When a(n) is even, a(n) is the number of prime digits present so far in the sequence, a(n) included.
%C A338745 The prime digits are 2, 3, 5 and 7. The prime numbers appear in their natural order in the sequence [except for the switch a(2)<->a(3)]. Some nonprimes will never appear (12 for instance).
%e A338745 The first even term is a(3) = 2 and there are indeed 2 prime digits so far in the sequence (3 and 2 itself);
%e A338745 The next even term is a(6) = 4 and there are now 4 prime digits so far (3, 2, 5 and 7);
%e A338745 The next even term is a(11) = 6 and there are now 6 prime digits so far (3, 2, 5, 7, 3 and 5); etc.
%Y A338745 Cf. A338741, A338742, A338743, A338744, A338746 (variants on the same idea).
