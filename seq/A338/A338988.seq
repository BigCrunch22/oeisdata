%N A338988 Number of rooted graceful labelings of the path P_n.
%C A338988 A graceful labeling of a graph with n edges assigns distinct labels l(v) to the vertices such that  0 <= l(v) <= n and the n differences |l(u) - l(v)| between labels of adjacent vertices are distinct. It is rooted if, in addition, either |l(u) - l(w)| > |l(u) - l(v)| for some neighbor of u or |l(v) - l(w)| > |l(u) -l(v)| for some neighbor of v, whenever |l(u) - l(v)| < n.
%C A338988 Two labelings of the path P_n are considered to be the same if we get one from the other by reflecting the path left<->right and/or by complementing the labels with respect to n-1. Thus we can assume that the labeling contains the subsequence (n-2)0(n-1) when n > 2.
%C A338988 If x[1]...x[t] is the subsequence containing all differences > k > 1, the subsequence for k-1 must be either (x[1]\pm k)x[1]...x[t] or x[1]...x[t](x[t]\pm k).
%C A338988 So a[n] <= 4^(n-3) for n > 2.

%e A338988 For n = 6 the a(6) = 3 canonical labelings are 140532, 214053, 231405.
%Y A338988 A338987 counts rooted graceful labelings of all graphs (times 2 when n > 1 because it also counts complementary labelings).
%Y A338988 A338986(n) = 4*a(n) when n > 2, because it also counts complementary labelings and reverses of labelings.
