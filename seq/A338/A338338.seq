%N A338338 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive numbers such that for any prime p, any run of consecutive multiples of p has length exactly 3.
%C A338338 If a prime p divides a(n), then there is a run of exactly three terms (one of which is a(n)) that are divisible by p.
%C A338338 If "three" is changed to "two", we get A280864.
%C A338338 Conjecture: This is a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A338338 After 1,2,4,6,3, we have had two successive multiples of 3, so the next term must be a multiple of 3 we have not yet seen, hence 9. The following term is then the smallest number not yet seen which is not a multiple of 3, hence 5.
