%N A338741 When a(n) is odd, a(n) is the number of odd digits present so far in the sequence, a(n) included.
%C A338741 The even nonnegative integers are present in their natural order. Some odd natural integers will never appear (19 for instance).
%e A338741 The first odd term is a(2) = 1 and there is indeed 1 odd digit so far in the sequence (1 itself);
%e A338741 The next odd term is a(8) = 3 and there are now 3 odd digits so far (1, 1 and 3);
%e A338741 The next odd term is a(10) = 5 and there are now 5 odd digits so far (1, 1, 3, 1 and 5);
%e A338741 ...
%e A338741 The next odd term is a(18) = 17 and there are indeed 17 odd digits so far in the sequence (1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 7, 1, 9, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 7); etc.
