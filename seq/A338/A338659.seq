%N A338659 The smallest positive number that can be added to n the maximum number of times, see A343921(n), such that the digits in each resulting sum are distinct, or -1 if no such number exists.
%F A338659 a(n) = -1 for n >= 9876543210.
%e A338659 a(0) = 27 as 27 can be added to 0 a total of A343921(0) = 36 times with each sum containing distinct digits. The 36 sums are 27, 54, 81, 108, 135, ..., 918, 945, 972. No other positive number can be added 36 or more times to 0 to produce such sums.
%e A338659 a(1) = 1 as 1 can be added to 1 a total of A343921(1) = 9 times with each sum containing distinct digits. The sums are 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. There are fourteen positive numbers in all which can be added to 1 a total of 9 times producing sums with distinct digits, the largest being 7012 (see A343922).
%e A338659 a(2) = 34 as 34 can be added to 2 a total of A343921(2) = 12 times with each sum containing distinct digits. The sums are 36, 70, 104, 138, 172, 206, 240, 274, 308, 342, 376, 410. No other positive number can be added 12 or more times to 2 to produce such sums.
