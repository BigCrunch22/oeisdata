%N A338384 Integers that can be written m = k*tau(k) = q*tau(q) where (k, q) is a primitive solution of this equation and tau(k) is the number of divisors of k.
%C A338384 As the multiplicativity of tau(k) ensures an infinity of solutions to the general equation m = k*tau(k) (see A338382), Richard K. Guy asked if, as for k*sigma(k) = q*sigma(q) (A337875, A337876), k*tau(k) = q*tau(q) has an infinity of primitive solutions, in the sense that (k', q') is not a solution for any k' = k/d, q' = q/d, d>1 (see reference Guy's book and 3rd example). The answer to this question seems not to be known today.

%e A338384 -> For a(1): 18 * tau(18) = 27 * tau(27) = 108.
%e A338384 -> For a(2): 24 * tau(24) = 32 * tau(32) = 192.
%e A338384 -> Why 1080 = A338382(4) is not a term? 90 * tau(90) = 135 * tau(135) = 1080 but as 90/5 = 18 and 135/5 = 27, this solution that is generated by the first example is not primitive.
%e A338384 -> For a(4) : 168 * tau(168) = 192 * tau(192) = 224 * tau(224) = A338382(8) = 2688.
%e A338384 1) for k=168 and q=192; with d=3, k/3=56 and q/3=64, with 56 * tau(56) = 64 * tau(64) = 448 = a(3), hence (168, 192) is not a primitive solution;
%e A338384 2) for k=168 and q=224; with d=7, k/7=24 and q/7=32, with 24 * tau(24) = 32 * tau(32) = 192 = a(2), hence (24, 32) is not a primitive solution; but
%e A338384 3) for k=192 and q=224, there is no common divisor d such that 192/d and 224/d can satisfy (192/d)*tau(192/d) = (224/d)*tau(224/d), so (192, 224) is a primitive solution linked to m = 2688 that is the term a(4).
