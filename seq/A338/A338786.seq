%F A338786 Complement of (the union of A002182 and A004394) and (the union of A002201 and A004490).
%e A338786 1 is in the sequence since it is the empty product, setting records for both the number of divisors and the sum of divisors, and it is neither also superior highly composite nor colossally abundant.
%e A338786 2 is not in the sequence since it is both colossally abundant and superior highly composite.
%e A338786 4 is in the sequence since it sets a record for the divisor counting and divisor sum functions, yet it is neither superior highly composite nor colossally abundant.
%e A338786 20951330400 is not in the sequence since it is colossally abundant though it is an HCN and SA. etc.
