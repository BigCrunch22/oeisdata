%N A338466 a(0) = 0; for n > 0, a(n) is the least positive integer not occurring earlier such that the digits in a(n-1)*a(n) are all distinct.
%C A338466 The sequence is finite, the 71782nd term being a(71781) = 50005 beyond which no number exists that has not occurred earlier such that 50005*a(n) has distinct digits. The maximum term is a(71428) = 175446.
%H A338466 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A338466/a338466.png">Image of the 71782 terms</a>. The green line is a(n) = n.
%e A338466 a(1) = 1 as a(0)*1 = 0*1 = 0 which has one distinct digit 0.
%e A338466 a(10) = 10 as a(9)*10 = 9*10 = 90 which has two distinct digits 9 and 0.
%e A338466 a(11) = 12 as a(10)*12 = 10*12 = 120 which has three distinct digits. Note that 11 is the first skipped number as 10*11 = 110 which has 1 as a duplicate digit.
%e A338466 a(12) = 11 as a(11)*11 = 12*11 = 132 which has three distinct digits.
