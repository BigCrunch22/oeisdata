%N A338623 a(n) is the length of the longest block of consecutive terms appearing twice (possibly with overlap) among the first n terms of the Thue-Morse sequence (A010060).
%C A338623 This sequence is weakly increasing and unbounded (as A010060 is bounded).

%F A338623 a(n) <= a(n+1) <= a(n) + 1.
%F A338623 a(A304588(n)) = n (and this is the first occurrence of n in the sequence).
%e A338623 For n = 8:
%e A338623 - the first 8 terms of A010060 are 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1,
%e A338623 - the blocks (0, 1) and (1, 0) are repeated, and there are no length-3 repeated block,
%e A338623 - so a(8) = 2.
