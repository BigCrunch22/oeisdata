%N A338275 Array of triples read by antidiagonals of triples, giving analogs of Pythagorean triples [a,b,c] being [odd,even,odd] consistent with the functions U(i;n,k) described in A327263.
%C A338275 In forming the triples we follow what we know about calculating Pythagorean triples given two positive integers m > n. That is, a = m^2 - n^2; b = 2m*n; c = m^2 + n^2. This is the case when i = 2. Here m is odd and n is even. The rows of triples are sorted by m then by n.
%C A338275 Within all rows of triples, each of a, b, and c are arithmetic progressions.
%C A338275 Within all rows of triples, consecutive triples have the same difference (delta) which is always an even multiple of a primitive Pythagorean triple.
%C A338275   delta_a = ((m-1)^2 - n^2)/2,
%C A338275   delta_b = (m-1)*n,
%C A338275   delta_c = ((m-1)^2 + n^2)/2.
%C A338275   When n = m - 1, delta_a = 0 while delta_b = delta_c, so delta_a^2 + delta_b^2 = delta_c^2 trivially.
%C A338275 In rows with n = m - 1, the following are true for all i:
%C A338275   a = m + n,
%C A338275   c = b + 1,
%C A338275   b + c = U(i; a, a).
%C A338275 Within all columns of triples, for each m, b is an arithmetic progression with difference 2m+2, a has a constant second difference of -4i and c has a constant second difference of +4i.
%C A338275 From _David Lovler_, Dec 04 2020: (Start)
%C A338275 If we modify the Pythagorean inradius formula according to the rules of U(i;odd,even), r = (m-n)*n becomes r = (i*(m-n)*n - (i-2)*n)/2. To distinguish this from the usual inradius let us call it the inradius computation or irc. The irc might not have a Euclidean interpretation, but using it brings light to the following theorem. Within a row of the table, the inradius of the (constant, Pythagorean) difference between consecutive triples equals the difference between the ircs of consecutive triples in the row, and both equal (m-n-1)*n/2.
%C A338275 Proof: The left hand side, according to A338895 and A338896, equals (m-n-1)*n/2. For the right hand side, given odd m and even n, irc(i+1) - irc(i) = U(i+1; m-n, n) - U(i; m-n, n) = ((i+1)*(m-n)*n - (i+1-2)*n)/2 - (i*(m-n)*n - (i-2)*n)/2 = (m-n-1)*n/2. (End)

%F A338275 Given i > 0, for each (odd,even) pair (m,n) with m >= 3 and m > n >= 2, the triple [a, b, c] consists of
%F A338275    a = (i*m^2 - (i-2)*(2m-1))/2 - (i*n^2)/2     analogous to m^2 - n^2
%F A338275    b =  i*m*n - (i-2)*n                         analogous to 2m*n
%F A338275    c = (i*m^2 - (i-2)*(2m-1))/2 + (i*n^2)/2     analogous to m^2 + n^2.
