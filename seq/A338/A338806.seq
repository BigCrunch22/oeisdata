%N A338806 Number of polyhedra formed when an n-antiprism, formed from two n-sided regular polygons joined by 2n adjacent alternating triangles, is internally cut by all the planes defined by any three of its vertices.
%C A338806 For an n-antiprism, formed from two n-sided regular polygons joined by 2n adjacent alternating triangles, create all possible internal planes defined by connecting any three of its vertices. For example, in the case of a triangular 3-antiprism this results in 3 planes. Use all the resulting planes to cut the prism into individual smaller polyhedra. The sequence lists the number of resulting polyhedra for antiprisms with n>=3.
%C A338806 See A338808 for the number and images of the k-faced polyhedra in each antiprism dissection.

%e A338806 a(3) = 8. The 3-antiprism is cut with 3 internal planes resulting in 8 polyhedra, all 8 pieces having 4 faces.
%e A338806 a(4) = 195. The 4-antiprism is cut with 16 internal planes resulting in 195 polyhedra; 128 with 4 faces, 56 with 5 faces, 8 with 6 faces, and 3 with 8 faces. Note the number of 8-faced polyhedra is not a multiple of 4 - they lie directly along the z-axis so are not symmetric with respect to the number of edges forming the regular n-gons.
