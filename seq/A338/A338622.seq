%N A338622 Irregular table read by rows: The number of k-faced polyhedra, where k>=4, formed when the five Platonic solids, in the order tetrahedron, octahedron, cube, icosahedron, dodecahedron, are internally cut by all the planes defined by any three of their vertices.

%H A338622 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A338622/a338622.png">Tetrahedron, showing the 1 4-faced polyhedra post-cutting</a>. This is the original tetrahedron itself as no internal cutting planes are present.
%H A338622 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A338622/a338622_3.png">Octahedron, showing the 8 4-faced polyhedra post-cutting</a>. The octahedron has 3 internal cutting planes, each along the 2D axial planes. For clarity in this image, and the two cube images, the pieces are moved away from the origin a distance proportional to the average distance of their vertices from the origin.
%H A338622 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A338622/a338622_1.png">Cube, showing the 72 4-faced polyhedra post-cutting</a>. The cube has 14 internal cutting planes.
%H A338622 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A338622/a338622_2.png">Cube, showing the 24 5-faced polyhedra post-cutting</a>. These form a perfect octahedron inside the original cube.

%e A338622 The cube is cut with 14 internal planes defined by all 3-vertex combinations of its 8 vertices. This leads to the creation of 72 4-faced polyhedra and 24 5-faced polyhedra, 96 pieces in all. See A338571 and A333539.
