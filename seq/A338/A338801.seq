Each piece has been moved away from the origin by a distance proportional to the average distance of its vertices from the origin. Red shows the seventeen 4-faced polyhedra, orange the single 6-faced polyhedron.

%F A338801 Sum of row n = A338783(n).
%e A338801 The triangular 3-prism is cut with 6 internal planes defined by all 3-vertex combinations of its 6 vertices. This leads to the creation of seventeen 4-faced polyhedra and one 6-faced polyhedra, eighteen pieces in all. The single 6-faced polyhedra lies at the very center of the original 3-prism.
%e A338801 The 9-prism is cut with 207 internal planes leading to the creation of 319864 pieces. It is noteworthy in creating all k-faced polyhedra from k=4 to k=18.
