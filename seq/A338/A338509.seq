%N A338509 a(n) is the number of ordered triples of divisors d_i < d_j < d_k of m such that GCD(d_i, d_j, d_k) > 1 where m is the least number having its prime signature; m = A025487(n).
%C A338509 Primitive sequence to A336530 as that sequence only depends on the prime signature of n.

%F A338509 a(n) = A336530(A025487(n)).
%e A338509 a(6) = 12 as A025487(6) = 12 and there are 5 triples of divisors of 12 (x, y, z) such that g = gcd(x, y, z) are 12. 4 of them have g = 2 as 12/2 = 6 has 4 divisors and binomial(4, 3) = 4, 1 of them has g = 3 as 12/3 = 4 has 3 divisors and binomial(3, 3) = 1 and 0 of them have g = 6 as 12/6 = 2 has 3 divisors and binomial(2, 3) = 0.
