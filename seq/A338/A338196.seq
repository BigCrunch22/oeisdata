%N A338196 The integers sorted according to the maximum number in their Collatz (3*x+1) orbit, and in the case of a tie, sorted according to their value.
%C A338196 Assuming the validity of the Collatz conjecture, this sequence is a permutation of the natural numbers.

%e A338196 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 4, a(4) = 8 are already the maximum in their orbit.
%e A338196 a(5) = 3, a(6) = 5, a(7) = 6, a(8) = 10, a(9) = 12, and a(10) = 16 all have an orbit with 16 as maximum and are therefore sorted by their size.
