%N A338593 Number of unlabeled connected nonplanar graphs with n edges with degree >= 3 at each node.
%C A338593 First differs from A338583 for n = 13. All unlabeled nonplanar graphs with n <= 12 edges and degree >= 3 at each node are 3-connected. For this reason the illustrations of the graphs are identical up to n = 12. The first differences for n = 13 and n = 14 are shown in the illustrations of A338584.
