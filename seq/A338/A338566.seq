%N A338566 Primes p such that (p*q) mod r is prime, where q and r are the next primes after p.
%C A338566 a(8) > 40000000 if it exists.
%C A338566 Note that p*q == (r-p)*(r-q) (mod r). As soon as the prime gap grows slow enough, for all large enough p we have (p*q) mod r = (r-p)*(r-q), which is composite, implying finiteness of this sequence. In particular, finiteness would follow from Cramer's conjecture. - _Max Alekseyev_, Nov 09 2024
%e A338566 a(3)=19 is in the sequence because it is prime, the next two primes are 23 and 29, and (19*23) mod 29 = 2, which is prime.
