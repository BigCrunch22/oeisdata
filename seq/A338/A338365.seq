%N A338365 a(n) = (index of prime(n) in A280985) - prime(n).
%C A338365 Gives amount by which primes are delayed in A280985. For comparison, the amount by which primes are delayed in A283312 is given by A107347. There is a simple formula for the latter sequence, but no such formula is presently known for the current sequence.
