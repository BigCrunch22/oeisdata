%N A338809 Number of polyhedra formed when an n-bipyramid, formed from two n-gonal pyraminds joined at the base, is internally cut by all the planes defined by any three of its vertices.
%C A338809 For a n-bipyramid, formed from two n-gonal pyraminds joined at the base, create all possible internal planes defined by connecting any three of its vertices. For example, in the case of a 3-bipyramid this results in 4 planes. Use all the resulting planes to cut the n-bipyramid into individual smaller polyhedra. The sequence lists the number of resulting polyhedra for bipyramids with n>=3.
%C A338809 See A338825 for the number and images of the k-faced polyhedra in each bipyramid dissection.
%C A338809 The author thanks _Zach J. Shannon_ for assistance in producing the images for this sequence.

%e A338809 a(3) = 12. The 3-bipyramid is cut with 4 internal planes resulting in 12 polyhedra, all 12 pieces having 4 faces.
%e A338809 a(5) = 120. The 5-bipyramid is cut with 16 internal planes resulting in 120 polyhedra, all 120 pieces having 4 faces.
%e A338809 a(7) = 756. The 7-bipyramid is cut with 36 internal planes resulting in 756 polyhedra; 448 with 4 faces, 280 with 5 faces, and 28 with 6 faces.
%e A338809 Note that for a single n-pyramid the number of polyhedra is the same as the number of regions in the dissection of a 2D n-polygon, see A007678, as all planes join two points on the polygon and the single apex, resulting in an equivalent number of regions.
