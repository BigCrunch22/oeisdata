%N A338174 The largest value that integer n is connected to in a web where every integer n has n connections, each integer is connected to the lowest values possible, and new values are added in phases.
%C A338174 The concept of this sequence is based on a web where every possible connection in the web is made with the numbers written so far, and then new numbers are added for every connection that needs to be made.
%e A338174 Start with a map of nothing but 1.
%e A338174    1 has 0 connections.
%e A338174 So we add 2 and connect it.
%e A338174    1 has 1 connection (2)
%e A338174    2 has 1 connection (1)
%e A338174 Now we need one more number to connect with 2, so we add 3.
%e A338174    2 has 2 connections (1,3)
%e A338174    3 has 1 connection (2)
%e A338174 Now because 3 needs two more numbers, we add 4 and 5 at once, and make as many connections as possible.
%e A338174    3 has 3 connections (2,4,5)
%e A338174    4 has 2 connections (3,5)
%e A338174    5 has 2 connections (3,4)
%e A338174 We need five more numbers because 4 lacks two connections, and 5 lacks three connections, so we add 6,7,8,9,10.
%e A338174    4 has 4 connections (3,5,6,7)
%e A338174    5 has 5 connections (3,4,8,9,10)
%e A338174    6 has 5 connections (4,7,8,9,10)
%e A338174    7 has 5 connections (4,6,8,9,10)
%e A338174    8 has 5 connections (5,6,7,9,10)
%e A338174    9 has 5 connections (5,6,7,8,10)
%e A338174    10 has 5 connections (5,6,7,8,9)
%e A338174 This continues indefinitely.
