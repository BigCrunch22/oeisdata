%N A338089 Minimal number of moves for the cyclic variant of Hanoi's tower for 4 pegs and n disks, with the final peg three steps away.

%F A338089 Conjecture: a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2) + a(n-3) - 2*a(n-5) for n > 9 (the same recurrence as conjectured in A292764 and A338024). - _Pontus von Br√∂mssen_, Oct 12 2020
%e A338089 For n=2, assume the two disks are on North initially, first move the smallest one to South in 2 moves, then the largest one to East in 1 move, the smallest one back to North in 2 moves, the largest one to West in 2 moves, and finally the smallest one to West in 3 moves, with a total of 10 moves. Each disk has a number of moves which is 3 mod 4, thus a(n) == 3*n (mod 4).
