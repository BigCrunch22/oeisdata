%N A338776 a(n) = card(GB(2*n)), where GB(n) is the set of primes which are Goldbach-associated with n.
%C A338776 For an integer n >= 0 we say a prime p is gb-associated with n if sqrt(n) < p <= n/2 and no prime q which is <= sqrt(n) divides p*(p - n). Let GB(n) be the set of integers which are gb-associated with n (for examples see A338777). a(n) is the number of primes which are gb-associated with n.
%C A338776 If a(n) > 0 for n >= 3 then Goldbach's conjecture is true.
