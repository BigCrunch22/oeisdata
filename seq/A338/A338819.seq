%N A338819 The entries in the rows of the n X n identity matrix, multiplied by the size of the matrix (n).
%e A338819 For every identity matrix of size n starting with n=1, append n*(each entry of each row of the matrix), e.g., n=1 -> 1, n=2 -> 2,0,0,2, so the first 5 terms of the sequence are 1,2,0,0,2.
