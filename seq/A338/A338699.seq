%N A338699 Sequence A is the primes.  Sequence B is the "smallest" sequence of nondecreasing powers of two whose sum over the first N terms is at least equal to the sum over the first N terms of Sequence A.  a(n) is the amount by which the sum of the first n terms of Sequence B exceeds the sum of the first n terms of Sequence A.
%C A338699 The definition is due to _Jack Brennen_.

%e A338699 We want to produce prime numbers out of nondecreasing "blocks" of powers of 2. Each time we use one block in addition to the remains of the previous block. To get 2, we need a block of 2. So a(1) = 2-2 = 0. To get 3, we need a block of 4. So a(2) = 4-3 = 1. To get 5, we need a block of 4 in addition to the remains of the previous block. So a(3) = 4+1-5 = 0.
