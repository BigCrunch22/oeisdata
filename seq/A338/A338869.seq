%N A338869 Shortest most frequent distance among first n primes.
%C A338869 Conjecture: Shortest most frequent distance among first n primes is a primorial number (A002110) for n>1.
%C A338869 This sequence is quite related to A338238 with which it shares many terms.
%C A338869 The corresponding frequencies of the most frequent distances among n first primes are in A283371.

%e A338869 For n = 2, the distance between the first two primes 2 and 3 is 1, so the only possible distance is also the most frequent one, then a(2) = 1.
%e A338869 For n = 3, the distances between the first three primes 2, 3 and 5 are 1 = 3 - 2, 3 = 5 - 2, and 2 = 5 - 3, so all three distances are different, have the same frequency, and the shortest among them is 1, then a(3) = 1.
%e A338869 For n = 4, the five different distances between the first four primes 2, 3, 5 and 7 are 1 = 3 - 2, 2 = 5 - 3 = 7 - 5, 3 = 7 - 4 , 4 = 7 - 3 and 5 = 7 - 2, then a(3) = 2 because 2 is the most common distance (two cases) compared with the other distances which appear only once.
%e A338869 For n = 32, the most frequent distances are 30 and 6, and both appear with the same frequency (19 cases), then a(32) = 6 because 6 is the shortest between 30 and 6.
