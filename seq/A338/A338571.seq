%N A338571 Number of polyhedra formed when the five Platonic solids, in the order tetrahedron, octahedron, cube, icosahedron, dodecahedron, are internally cut by all the planes defined by any three of their vertices.
%C A338571 For a Platonic solid create all possible planes defined by connecting any three of its vertices. For example, in the case of a cube this results in fourteen planes; six planes between the pairs of parallel edges connected to each end of the face diagonals, and eight planes from connecting the three vertices adjacent to each corner vertex. Use all the resulting planes to cut the solid into individual smaller polyhedra. The sequence lists the numbers of resulting polyhedra for the Platonic solids, ordered by number of vertices: tetrahedron, octahedron, cube, icosahedron, dodecahedron.
%C A338571 See A338622 for the number and images of the k-faced polyhedra in each dissection for each of the five solids.
%C A338571 The author thanks _Zach J. Shannon_ for producing the images for this sequence.

%H A338571 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A338571/a338571_6.png">Tetrahedron, showing the one polyhedra pre and post-cutting</a>. The tetrahedron has no internal cutting planes so remains unaltered.
%H A338571 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A338571/a338571_2.png">Octahedron, showing the 8 polyhedra post-cutting</a>.  All pieces have 4 faces. The plane cuts are along the edges of the octahedron and thus only 3 internal cutting planes exist, each along the three 2D axial planes.

Each piece has been moved away from the origin by a distance proportional to the average distance of its vertices from the origin. Red shows the 4-faced polyhedra, orange the 5-faced polyhedra. The later form a perfect octahedron inside the original cube, the points of which touch the cube's surface. See A338622.

%e A338571 a(1) = 1. The tetrahedron has no internal cutting planes so the single polyhedron after cutting is the tetrahedron itself.
%e A338571 a(2) = 8. The octahedron has 3 internal cutting planes resulting in 8 polyhedra.
%e A338571 a(3) = 96. The cube has 14 internal cutting planes resulting in 96 polyhedra. See also A333539.
%e A338571 a(4) = 2520. The icosahedron has 47 cutting planes resulting in 2520 polyhedra.
%e A338571 See A338622 for a breakdown of the above totals into the corresponding number of k-faced polyhedra.
%e A338571 a(5) = 552600. The dodecahedron has 307 internal cutting planes resulting in 552600 polyhedra. It is the only Platonic solid which produces polyhedra with 6 or more faces.
