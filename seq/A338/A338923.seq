%N A338923 Every even term k of the sequence is the cumulative sum of the even digits used so far (the digits of k are included in the sum).
%C A338923 This is the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct nonnegative terms with this property.

%e A338923 a(1) = 0 as 0 is the sum of all even digits used so far:
%e A338923 a(2) = 1 as 1 is the smallest term not yet present in the sequence that doesn't lead to a contradiction;
%e A338923 a(3) = 2 as 2 is the sum of all even digits used so far (0 + 2);
%e A338923 a(4) = 3 as 3 is the smallest term not yet present in the sequence that doesn't lead to a contradiction;
%e A338923 ...
%e A338923 a(17) = 10 as 10 is the sum of all even digits used so far (0 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 0);
%e A338923 a(18) = 12 as 12 is the sum of all even digits used so far (0 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 2);
%e A338923 a(19) = 29 as 29 is the smallest term not yet present in the sequence that doesn't lead to a contradiction; etc.
