%N A338743 When a(n) is odd, a(n) is the number of even digits present so far in the sequence, a(n) included.
%C A338743 The even nonnegative integers are present in their natural order. Some odd natural integers will never appear (11 for instance).
%e A338743 The first odd term is a(2) = 1 and there is indeed 1 even digit so far in the sequence (0);
%e A338743 The next odd term is a(5) = 3 and there are now 3 even digits so far (0, 2 and 4);
%e A338743 The next odd term is a(8) = 5 and there are now 5 even digits so far (0, 2, 4, 6 and 8);
%e A338743 ...
%e A338743 The term a(21) = 21 and there are indeed 21 even digits in the sequence so far (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 6, 2, 8, 2); etc.
