%N A163791 a(n) is the n-th J_11-prime (Josephus_11 prime).
%C A163791 Place the numbers 1..N (N>=2) on a circle and cyclicly mark the 11th unmarked number until all N numbers are marked. The order in which the N numbers are marked defines a permutation; N is a J_11-prime if this permutation consists of a single cycle of length N.
%C A163791 There are 12 J_11-primes in the interval 2..1000000 only. No formula is known; the J_11-primes have been found by exhaustive search.
