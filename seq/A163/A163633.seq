%N A163633 4n^2-2n+p: p=5,n=0,1,2 connects to next p=17,n=0,1,2 connects to next p=29,n=0,1,2 connects to next 4n^2-2n+41 where n=0,1,-1,2,-2,3,-3,... This is part of Prime Helix and for 41 an extension of Euler's x^2-x+41 but this sequence has 46 primes. The first are twin primes with 12 separation.
