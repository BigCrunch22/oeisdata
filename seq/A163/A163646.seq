%N A163646 Two copies of the twin primes inserted at positions depending on prime(n) being isolated or not.
%C A163646 The indices n of this sequence are labeled individually by 0 or 1 depending on whether prime(n) is in the list of isolated primes (A007510) or in the list of twin primes (A001097), which yields 0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,....
%C A163646 The sequence is defined by placing one copy of the twin prime sequence A001097 at the positions labeled 0, and a second copy of the twin prime sequence at the positions labeled 1.
%Y A163646 Cf. A000040, A001097, A007510.
