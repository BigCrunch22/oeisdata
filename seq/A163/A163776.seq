%N A163776 a(n) is the n-th dS-prime (dual Shuffle prime).
%C A163776 For N>=2, the family of dual shuffle permutations is defined by p(m,N) = -2m (mod N+1) if N is even, p(m,N) = -2m (mod N) if N is odd and 1<=m<N, p(N,N) = N if N is odd. N is dS-prime if p(m,N) consists of a single cycle of length N. So all dS-primes are even.
%C A163776 No formula is known for a(n): the dS-primes have been found by exhaustive search. But we have: N is dS-prime iff p=N+1 is an odd prime number and -2 generates Z_p^* (the multiplicative group of Z_p).

%F A163776 a(n) = 2*A163781(n).
%e A163776 For N=6 and N=10 we obtain the permutations (1 5 4 6 2 3) and (1 9 4 3 5)(2 7 8 6 10): 6 is dS-prime, but 10 is not.
%Y A163776 a(n)/2 results in the dual Josephus_2-primes (A163781). Considered as sets a(n)/2 is the union of A163777 and A163780. If b(n) denotes the shuffle primes (A071642), then the union of a(n)/2 and b(n)/2 is equal to the Twist-primes or Queneau numbers (A054639), their intersection is equal to the Archimedes_0-primes (A163777).
