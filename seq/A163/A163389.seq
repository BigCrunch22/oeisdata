%N A163389 The position of first occurrence of n-th prime in A014085.
%e A163389 The first ten terms of A014085 are 2,2,2,3,2,4,3,4,3,5. prime(1) = 2 is the first element, prime(2) = 3 is the 4th element, prime(3)= 5 is the 10th element; so 1,4,10 are the first three elements of this sequence.
%o A163389 (PARI) f(n) = primepi((n+1)^2)-primepi(n^2); \\ A014085
