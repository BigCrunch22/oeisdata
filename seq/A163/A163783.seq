%N A163783 a(n) is the n-th J_3-prime (Josephus_3 prime).
%C A163783 Place the numbers 1..N (N>=2) on a circle and cyclicly mark the 3rd unmarked number until all N numbers are marked. The order in which the N numbers are marked defines a permutation; N is a J_3-prime if this permutation consists of a single cycle of length N.
%C A163783 There are 14 J_3-primes in the interval 2..1000000 only. No formula is known; the J_3-primes have been found by exhaustive search.
