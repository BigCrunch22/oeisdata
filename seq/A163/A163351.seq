%N A163351 Triangle T(n,k) = m, 0<=k<=n, read by rows, where each decimal digit d of the integer m is the minimum of the corresponding decimal digits of n and k.
%C A163351 The number k is left-padded with zeros as necessary for comparison with n.
%C A163351 Clearly, for all n>=0, T(n,0) = 0 and T(n,n) = n.
%C A163351 For all A051885(n), T(A051885(n),k) = k; no other rows have this pattern.
%e A163351 T(10,1) = 0 = a(56) as 0<1 in both tens and units positions. Sequence first differs from A002262 here.
%e A163351 T(104,53) = 3 as 3<4, 0<5, and 0<1.
%Y A163351 Cf. A163352, A002262, A080098.
