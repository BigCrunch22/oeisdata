%N A163742 Prime pairs (p,q) of the form p=A002315(k), q=A001653(k) for some k.
%C A163742 By construction, all these pairs satisfy p^2 -2*q^2 = -1.
%C A163742 One can generate the combined A002315 and A001653 by a mixed recursion 3p+4q -> p; 2p+3q -> q, and then test after each step both p and q for primality.

%e A163742 (A002315(1),A001653(1)) = (7,5) are both prime and define the first pair in the sequence.
%e A163742 (A002315(2),A001653(2)) = (41,29) are both prime and define the second pair in the sequence.
%e A163742 (A002315(3),A001653(3)) = (239,169=13^2) contain the composite 169 and do not contribute to the sequence.
%Y A163742 Bisections are (essentially): A086397, A118612.
