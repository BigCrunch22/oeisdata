%N A163501 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers such that a(n) shares no digit with a(a(n)) for all n.
%C A163501 This is an example of a sequence whose initial behavior is quite different from its limiting behavior. It starts out looking as though most numbers will appear in the sequence, but in fact it has density 0. It can't include any number that has all nine nonzero digits, and those have density 1. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Apr 03 2009
