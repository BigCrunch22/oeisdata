%N A163820 Number of permutations of the divisors of n that are greater than 1, in which consecutive elements are not coprime.
%C A163820 a(n) depends only on prime signature of n (cf. A025487). So a(60) = a(90) since 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5 and 90 = 2 * 3^2 * 5 both have prime signature (2,1,1). - _Antti Karttunen_, Oct 22 2017
%C A163820 As a consequence of the comment above, a(n) = a(A046523(n)). - _David A. Corneth_, Oct 22 2017

%F A163820 From _Antti Karttunen_, Oct 22 2017: (Start)
%F A163820 a(p^n) = A000142(n), for all primes p.

%e A163820 The divisors of 12 that are > 1 are 2,3,4,6,12. In the permutations that are counted, 3 cannot be next to 2 or 4. However, a permutation that is among those counted is 6,2,4,12,3. The GCDs of adjacent pairs in this permutation are gcd(6,2)=2, gcd(2,4)=2, gcd(4,12)=4, gcd(12,3)=3. Note that all of these GCDs are > 1.
