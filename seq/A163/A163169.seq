%N A163169 a(n) = minimal number of consecutive integers required which when summed make n.
%C A163169 Zeros occur where no number of consecutive integers can be summed to make n; This only happens where n is an even power of two, or zero itself.
%C A163169 Entries where this sequence is nonzero are in A138591.

%e A163169 20 = 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6; No shorter sequence of consecutive integers sums to 20 and so a(20) = the number of elements in {2,3,4,5,6} = 5.
%e A163169 15 = 4 + 5 + 6, but also 15 = 7 + 8, so a(15) = 2, since this is the minimum.
