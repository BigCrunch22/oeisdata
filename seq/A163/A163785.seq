%N A163785 a(n) is the n-th J_5-prime (Josephus_5 prime).
%C A163785 Place the numbers 1..N (N>=2) on a circle and cyclicly mark the 5th unmarked number until all N numbers are marked. The order in which the N numbers are marked defines a permutation; N is a J_5-prime if this permutation consists of a single cycle of length N.
%C A163785 There are 21 J_5-primes in the interval 2..1000000 only. No formula is known; the J_5-primes have been found by exhaustive search.
