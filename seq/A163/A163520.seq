%N A163520 a(n) is the least integer x such that n < x and the product n*x is divisible by an integer y where n < y < x.
%C A163520 a(n) is the smallest area of an integer-sided rectangle able to enclose without contact an integer-sided rectangle of area n. The enclosing rectangle has sides A033676(n)+1 and A033677(n)+1. See the first formula below. - _Peter Munn_, Apr 26 2019

%F A163520 a(n) = (A033676(n)+1) * (A033677(n)+1).
%F A163520 a(n) = n + A033676(n) + A033677(n) + 1.
%F A163520 a(n) = n + A063655(n) + 1.
%F A163520 a(n^2) = (n+1)^2; a(n^2-n) = n^2 + n.
%F A163520 a(p) = 2*(p+1) for p prime.
%e A163520 For example, a(6)=12
%e A163520 since 6*7 is not divisible by any number between 6 and 7,
%e A163520 and 6*8 is not divisible by any number between 6 and 8,
%e A163520 and 6*9 is not divisible by any number between 6 and 9,
%e A163520 and 6*10 is not divisible by any number between 6 and 10,
%e A163520 and 6*11 is not divisible by any number between 6 and 11,
%e A163520 but 6*12 is divisible by 9 which is between 6 and 12.
