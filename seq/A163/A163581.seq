%N A163581 Number of zeros of sin(x) in integer intervals starting with (0,1).
%F A163581 a(n) = 1 if n < m*pi < (n+1) for any positive integer m; a(n) = 0 otherwise.
%F A163581 For n>0, a(A022844(n)) = 1. - _Michel Marcus_, Aug 07 2013
%e A163581 For n = 0, 1 and 2, sin(x) has no zeros in the intervals (0,1), (1,2) and (2,3), respectively, so a(0), a(1) and a(2) are all zero. For n = 3, sin(x) has a zero in the interval (3,4) at x = pi, so a(3) = 1.
%Y A163581 Cf. A163584.
