%N A163185 Primes p such that the equation x^2 = -2 mod p has a solution, and ord_p(-2) is even.
%C A163185 Such primes are the exceptional p for which x^2 == -2 (mod p) has a solution, as x^2 == -2 (mod p) is soluble for *every* p with ord_p(-2) odd. But if ord_p(-2) is even and p - 1 = 2^r.j with j odd, then x^2 == -2 (mod p) is soluble if and only if ord_p(-2) is not divisible by 2^r.
%C A163185 More generally, the equation x^(2^k) == -2 (mod p) has a solution iff either ord_p(-2) is odd or (p == 1 (mod 2^(k+1)) and ord_p(-2) is even but not divisible by 2^(r-k+1)).
%C A163185 Proof: Choose primitive root g mod p with -2 == g^a (mod p), where a = (p-1)/ord_p(-2). Writing x = g^u, see that solving x^(2^k) == -2 (mod p) is equivalent to solving u*2^k + v*(p-1) = a for some integers u,v.
%C A163185 A necessary and sufficient condition for this is that gcd(2^k,p-1) | a. So for p-1 = j*2^r, j odd and ord_p(-2) = h*2^s, h odd, condition becomes min(k,r) <= r-s. If s = 0 (i.e., ord_p(-2) odd) this is always valid; for positive s we need k < r-s+1, or s < r-k+1.
