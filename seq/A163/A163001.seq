%e A163001 The 10th prime is 29. Checking: 29-2=27 is divisible by 10-1=9. 29-3=26 is not divisible by 10-2=8. 29-5=24 is not divisible by 10-3=7. 29-7=22 is not divisible by 10-4=6. 29-11=18 is not divisible by 10-5=5. 29-13=16 is divisible by 10-6=4. 29-17=12 is divisible by 10-7=3. 29-19=10 is divisible by 10-8=2. And 29-23=6 is divisible by 10-9=1. There are therefore five k's where prime(10)-prime(k) is divisible by 10-k. So a(10)=5.
