%N A163786 a(n) is the n-th J_6-prime (Josephus_6 prime).
%C A163786 Place the numbers 1..N (N>=2) on a circle and cyclicly mark the 6th unmarked number until all N numbers are marked. The order in which the N numbers are marked defines a permutation; N is a J_6-prime if this permutation consists of a single cycle of length N.
%C A163786 There are 28 J_6-primes in the interval 2..1000000 only. No formula is known; the J_6-primes were found by exhaustive search.
