%N A163858 Number of sexy prime triples (p, p+6, p+12) where p+18 is not prime (although p-6 might be), with p <= n.
%C A163858 p-6 will be prime if the prime triple contains the last 3 primes of a sexy prime quadruple.
%C A163858 There are two sexy prime triples classes, (-1, -1, -1) (mod 6) and (+1, +1, +1) (mod 6). They should asymptotically have the same number of triples, if there is an infinity of such triples, although with a Chebyshev bias expected against the quadratic residue class triples (+1, +1, +1) (mod 6), which doesn't affect the asymptotic result. This sequence counts both classes.
%C A163858 Also the sexy prime triples of class (-1, -1, -1) (mod 6) fall within (11, 17, 23, 29) (mod 30) while the sexy prime triples of class (+1, +1, +1) (mod 6) fall within (1, 7, 13, 19) (mod 30).

%Y A163858 A046120 Largest member of a sexy prime triple, value of p+12 where (p, p+6, p+12) are all prime but p+18 is not (although p-6 might be.)
