%N A163143 The sum of the digits of each number in the sequence is equal to the sum of the digits of its factors when written in a certain way as a product of numbers each raised to some power (the sum includes the digits of the exponents).
%C A163143 We call these numbers "zipper numbers", because the factorization resembles a zipper both graphically and the way one would go about summing the digits.
%C A163143 Zipper numbers are similar to vampire numbers, that is, there can be many ways to factor a number as a product of powers; e.g., 36=6^2, but one has to find the correct way, i.e., that that will yield the same digit sum. Obviously, some restrictions must be made; e.g., the use of x^0 and 1^x is forbidden. Note that 8=4^1*2^1, 27=3^2*3^1 and 44=11^1*4^1 are not prime factorizations.
%C A163143 The consecutive numbers 25,26,27 can be called triple zippers or trip-zips; how many more are there? Prime numbers and powers of 10 can never be zippers.
%C A163143 Triple zippers: 25 = 5^2, 26 = 2^1*13^1, 27 = 3^1*3^2; 182 = 13^1*14^1, 183 = 3^1*61^1, 184 = 2^1*2^2*23^1; 735 = 7^1*105^1, 736 = 2^3*4^1*23^1, 737 = 11^1*67^1; 902 = 22^1*41^1, 903 = 21^1*43^1, 904 = 2^1*2^2*113^1. - _Ray Chandler_, Apr 30 2010
%C A163143 Quadruple zipper: 782 = 2^1*391^1, 783 = 3^3*29^1, 784 = 2^3*7^1*14^1, 785 = 5^1*157^1. - _Ray Chandler_, Apr 30 2010

%e A163143 The number 36 can be factored as 36=2^2*3^2, and 3+6 = 9 = 2+2+3+2. The number 121 can be factored as 121=11^2. The number 8 is a nonprime zipper number as it can be written as 8 = 4^1*2^1 and 8 = 4+1+2+1.
