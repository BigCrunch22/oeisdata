%N A163398 Numbers m such that all numbers 10*m+(odd single-digit number) and 100*m+(any 2-digit, digits coprime to 10) are composite.
%C A163398 The first requirement is that 10m+1, 10m+3, 10m+5, 10m+7 and 10m+9 are all composite; for 10*m+5 with the divisor 5 this is redundant. The second requirement is that 100*m plus any 2-digit number of A136333 is also composite.
%e A163398 m=167 is in the sequence because 1671, 1673, 1677, 1679, 16711, 16713, 16717, 16719, 16731,
%e A163398 16733, 16737, 16739, 16771, 16773, 16777, 16779, 16791, 16793, 16797, 16799 are composites.
