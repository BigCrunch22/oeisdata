%N A163755 a(0)=1. For n>=1, write n in binary. Let b(n,m) be the length of the m-th run of 0's or 1's, reading right to left. Then a(n) = product{m=1 to M} p(m)^b(n,m), where p(m) is the m-th prime, and M is the number of runs of 0's and 1's in binary n.
%C A163755 This sequence is a permutation of the terms of sequence A055932.
%C A163755 Clarification: By "run" of 0's or 1's in binary n, it is meant a group either entirely of 0's, and bounded by 1's or the edge of the binary number interpreted as a string, or entirely of 1's, and bounded by 0's or the edge of the string. In other words, the runs of 0's alternate with the runs of 1's.

%e A163755 13 in binary is 1101. So reading right to left, there is a run of one 1, followed by a run of one 0, followed by a run of two 1's. So the lengths of the runs are 1,1,2. Therefore a(13) = p(1)^1 * p(2)^1 * p(3)^2 = 2^1 * 3^1 * 5^2 = 150.
