%N A163897 a(n) = A163531(n)-A163547(n).
%C A163897 This sequence gives the difference of squares of distance from the origin to the n-th term, in the Peano curve (A163334) and the Hilbert curve (A163357) on an N x N grid. Because the Hilbert curve is based on powers of 4 and the Peano curve on powers of 9, the graph of this sequence contains dramatic swings.  [Edited to Peano vs Hilbert by _Kevin Ryde_, Aug 28 2020]
