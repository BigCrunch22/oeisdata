%N A163498 Those primes p that after each is written in binary, and a 0 is inserted before every 1, then the value of this new number is also prime.
%C A163498 Equal to primes p such that when written in binary, and a 0 is inserted after every binary digit 1, results in 2 times a prime number. For example, 13 is in the list as 13 is 1101 in binary.  Inserting 0 after every 1 results in 1010010 = 82 decimal, which is 2*41 and 41 is prime. - _Chai Wah Wu_, Jul 29 2014

%e A163498 13 in binary is 1101. Insert a 0 before every 1, and we have 0101001, which is 41 in decimal (ignoring the leading 0 in the binary representation). Since 41 is also prime, then 13 is included in this sequence.
