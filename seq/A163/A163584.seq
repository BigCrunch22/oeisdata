%N A163584 Number of singularities of tan(x) in integer intervals starting with (0,1).
%F A163584 For n>0, a(A062389(n)) = 1. - _Michel Marcus_, Aug 07 2013
%e A163584 a(0) = 0 because tan(x) has no singularities in the interval (0,1).
%e A163584 a(1) = 1 because tan(x) has one singularity in the interval (1,2).
