%N A163407 Sum of semiprime divisors of n with repetition.
%C A163407 We regard each prime divisor of n as distinct, and count each product of an unordered, distinct pair of them as a semiprime divisor.
%H A163407 Antti Karttunen, <a href="/A163407/b163407.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..20000</a>
%F A163407 If s is the sum of the prime divisors of n with repetition, and ss is the sum of their squares, a(n) = (s^2 - ss) / 2.
%e A163407 For n = 12, the prime divisors with repetition are 2,2,3. Distinguishing the 2s as 2 and 2', we have semiprime divisors 2*2', 2*3, and 2'*3, totaling 4+6+6 = 16.
