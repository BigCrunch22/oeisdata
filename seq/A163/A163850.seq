%N A163850 Primes p such that their distance to the nearest cube above p and also their distance to the nearest cube below p are prime.
%C A163850 The two sequences A048763(p) and A048762(p), p=A000040(n), define
%C A163850 nearest cubes above and below each prime p. If p is in A146318, the
%C A163850 distance to the larger cube, A048763(p)-p, is prime. If p is
%C A163850 in the set {3, 11, 13, 19, 29, 67,...,107, 127, 223,..}, the distance to the lower
%C A163850 cube is prime. If both of these distances are prime, we insert p into the sequence.
%e A163850 p=3 is in the sequence because the distance p-1=2 to the cube 1^3 below 3, and also the distance 8-p=5 to the cube 8=2^3 above p are prime.
%e A163850 p=127 is in the sequence because the distance p-125=2 to the cube 125=5^3 below p, and also the distance 216-p=89 to the cube 216=6^3 above p, are prime.
