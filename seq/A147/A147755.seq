%N A147755 a(n) = the largest integer that, when represented in binary, occurs at least twice as a substring in the binary representation of n.
%C A147755 The substrings (each equal to the binary representation of a(n)) may overlap in the binary representation of n.

%e A147755 21 in binary is 10101. 101 (5 in decimal) occurs twice in 10101: (101)01 and 10(101). Since no larger integer (when represented in binary) occurs more than once within 10101, then a(21) = 5.
