%N A147306 Numbers C in successive records of the merit function of the ABC conjecture considering only C from A033845.
%C A147306 In a variant of the ABC conjecture (see A120498) we look at triples (A,B,C) restricted to A+B=C, gcd(A,B)=1, and at the merit function L(A,B,C)=log(C)/log(rad(A*B*C)), where rad() is the squarefree kernel A007947, as usual. Watching for records in L() as C runs through the integers generates A147302. In this sequence here, we admit only the C of the sequence A033845, which avoids some early larger records that would be created by unrestricted C, and leads to a slower increase of the L-values.
%C A147306 If the ABC conjecture is true this sequence is finite.
%C A147306 The associated numbers B for this case are A147305, the associated A are A147307.
%e A147306 (A,B,C) = (1,5,6) defines the first record, L=0.5268.. (A,B,C)=(1,11,12) reaches L=0.5931..
%e A147306 (A,B,C) = (1,17,18) reaches L=0.6249.. The first C-number selected from A033845 that does not generate a new record is 72.
