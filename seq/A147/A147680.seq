%N A147680 Number of disk polyominoes of order n (see Comments for definition).
%C A147680 Any closed disk in the real plane includes a finite set (possibly empty) of points from the square lattice Z^2.
%C A147680 These roughly-circular patches of lattice points are connected by chains of adjacent lattice points (this is an easy theorem) and hence they form a special class of polyominoes, which I call "disc polyominoes".
%C A147680 It's quite easy to calculate which lattice points are within a given radius of a given center, but the inverse problem can be a little challenging.
%C A147680 That is, given a polyomino, determine whether it is a disk polyomino.
%C A147680 I have been enumerating small disk polyominoes, to see how many configurations are possible for various numbers of lattice points.
%C A147680 There is one disk polyomino for each of the orders 0, 1, 2 and 3; two for each of the orders 4, 5 and 6; only one for order 7; two each for orders 9 and 10; and three each for orders 11 and 12.
%e A147680 The following is a list of the polyominoes that have been shown to be disks.
%e A147680 I use the notation we used to use for small Life patterns, where each row is represented by the value of a binary number whose ones show which points are part of the configuration. These numbers are usually small, and we write the different row-descriptors with no delimiter between them, going up to letters of the alphabet if we run out of digits. We usually pick a scan order that minimizes the maximum description.
%e A147680 For order 0, we of course have only (0), and for order 1 only (1).
%e A147680 Order 2 gives (11), and order 3 gives the L-tromino (13). Order 4 has two examples, the block (33) and the T-tetromino (131). Order 5 gives the P-pentomino (133) and the X-pentomino (272).
%e A147680 Order 6: (273), (333).
%e A147680 Order 7: (373).
%e A147680 Order 8: (377), (2772).
%e A147680 Order 9: (777), (2773).
%e A147680 Order 10: (2777), (3773), (27f6). (That "f" means 15, with four adjacent points in a row included in the polyomino.)
%e A147680 Order 11: (3777), (27f7), (67f6).
%e A147680 Order 12: (7777), (2ff7), (27f72), (6ff6).
%e A147680 Order 13: (77f7), (6ff7), (27ff2),(4eve4). (The "v" represents a decimal 31, binary 11111, a row of five lattice-points.)
%e A147680 Order 14: (7ff7), (2fff2), (27ff6), (4eve6).
%e A147680 Order 15: (7fff), (2fff6), (4evee), (4evf6).
