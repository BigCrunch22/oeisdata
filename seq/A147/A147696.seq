%N A147696 Triangle read by rows: numbers n and columns k such that T(n, k) is n mod k.
%C A147696 The triangle begins with (2, 2).
%C A147696 Each row can be produced from the previous row by adding one to each number and resetting to zero any which would equal their column number. A number p > 2 is prime iff row p contains no zeros.
%C A147696 A new column k begins at row n when n is a perfect square. T(n, k) is then 1, while T(n, sqrt(n) = k - 1) is 0.
%C A147696 Zeros correspond to ones in the Redheffer matrix. Various interesting patterns exist. For example, as noted above, T(n^2, n) = 0. Also:
%C A147696 T(n^2 + n, n) = T(n^2 + n, n + 1) = 0
%C A147696 T(n^2 + n - 2, n - 1) = 0
%C A147696 T(n^2 - 1, n - 1) = 0
%C A147696 For all k in some [0, c]:
%C A147696 T(n^2, 2 + k) = 0 if n is even
%C A147696 T(n^2, 2 + k) = 1 if n is odd
%C A147696 T(n^2 + n, 2 + k) = 0
%C A147696 Every zero is located on some parabola directed toward n = 0, having either even width and produced by an even sequence; or having an odd width and produced by an odd sequence. In either case, the relevant sequence has constant first differences 2. T(n^2, n) begins an odd parabola, while T(n^2 + n, n) begins an even parabola and parabolas of either variety extend from infinitely many other locations.
