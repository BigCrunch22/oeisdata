%N A147640 The numbers A associated with the search for records in the ABC conjecture constrained as described in A147639.
%C A147640 The standard way to search for records in the ABC conjecture is to run with the C parameter through all the integers A000027. If this search space is diluted by admitting only powers of 2 as in A147639, the sequence of records changes. This sequence here lists the A such that the triples (A=a(n), B=A147638(n), C=A147639(n)) locate records for this search when C is restricted to powers of 2.
%Y A147640 Cf. A085152, A085153, A147298-A147307, A147638-A147643.
