%N A087594 Define dd(n) = the number formed by concatenating the absolute difference of successive digits. Sequence contains primes p such that dd(p)=q is a prime, dd(q) is also a prime = r and so on until a single-digit prime (2,3,5,7) arises. (Primes in which the number formed by successive digit differences are primes at every step until a single-digit prime is obtained.).
%C A087594 Conjecture: Sequence is infinite. Subsidiary sequence: number of n-digit members.

%e A087594 29 is a member as absolute(2-9) = 7 is a prime.
%e A087594 347 is a member as dd(347) = 13, dd(13) = 2.
