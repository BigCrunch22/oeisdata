%N A087641 Start of the first sequence of exactly n consecutive pairs of twin primes.
%C A087641 Start of the smallest twin prime clusters of order n such that the following and preceding two primes must be neither twin primes between themselves nor with the ends of the string. - Herman Jamke (hermanjamke(AT)fastmail.fm), Oct 22 2006
%C A087641 Sequences of n consecutive pairs of twin primes are called twin prime clusters of order n. Here (and in the sequences A035789, ..., A035795) it is requested that the order be exactly n, i.e., the preceding prime and the following prime must not be (upper resp. smaller) member of another twin prime pair. Note that a(3)=5 is preceded by 3 which is member of the twin prime pair (3,5) but not upper member of a preceding twin prime pair. Since it cannot happen elsewhere that P2=P3-2 if P3=P4-2 (using notations of A179067 and A035791), there is no condition imposed on P3-P2, and the condition on P2-P1 is also satisfied for P3=5. This sequence lists the starting prime of the cluster corresponding to the first occurrence of n in A179067. - _M. F. Hasler_, May 04 2015
