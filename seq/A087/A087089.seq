%N A087089 Periods of logistic map intervals in order of size.
%C A087089 The region of stability for period 8 after the point where period 4 splits in two is from 3.5440903596 to 3.5644072661 or a width of .0203169065. The period 3 cycle starts at 3.8284271247 = 1+sqrt(8) and ends at 3.8414990075, a width of .0130718828. This is less than that of period 8 so it follows it in sequence. The logistic map is just the real part of the Mandelbrot set.
%C A087089 The equation f(x)=a*x(1-x), f2(x)=f(f(x)) has a period 3 oscillation whenever 3.82843<a<3.84150.
