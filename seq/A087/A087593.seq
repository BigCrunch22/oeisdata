%N A087593 Define dd(n) = the number formed by concatenating the absolute difference of successive digits. Sequence contains primes p such that dd(p) is also prime. (Primes in which the number formed by successive digit difference is also a prime.).
%C A087593 Conjecture: Sequence is infinite. Subsidiary sequence: number of n-digit members.
