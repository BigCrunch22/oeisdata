%N A087382 Twin prime indices of primes forming a twin prime member.
%C A087382 It is interesting that these primes occur rather frequently early on but gradually diminish as the iterations increase. Some ratios of count of twin primes p and the occurrence of prime(p) also a twin prime is as follows. Index< Ratio 1000 .74 10000 .48 100000 .39 1000000 .35 Looks like it is approaching a limit.
%e A087382 The 29th prime,109,is also a twin prime paired with the prime 107.
