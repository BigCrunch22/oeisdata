%S A087551 11,13,13,13,97,97
%N A087551 Start of the second run of n successive primes which have the same successive differences as the prime sequence (7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,...) beginning with 7. The first differences are 4,2,4,2,4,6,2,6,4,2,4,6,6,2,6,4,2,...
%C A087551 Comment from _Don Reble_, Sep 21 2003: There are no more terms. The seven primes starting with 7 (7,11,13,17,19,23,29) cover all possible remainders modulo 7.
%e A087551 The first differences of 7,11,13,17,19,23 match those of 97,101,103,107,109,113, hence a(6) =97.
