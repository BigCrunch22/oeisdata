%N A087295 Successive remainders when computing the Euclidean algorithm for (n,m) where m is any positive integer having no common factor with n, gives a list ending with a sublist of Fibonacci sequence. Find m such that this sublist has the greatest length and define a(n) as this length.
%e A087295 a(5) = 3 because computing Euclidean algorithm for (5,8) gives 3, 2, 1 as successive remainders, all three belonging to Fibonacci sequence.
