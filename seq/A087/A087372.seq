%N A087372 Smallest k such that 3^k + 2n is a prime, or 0 if no such k exists. Index of the smallest power of 3 which when increased by the n-th even number yields a prime.
%C A087372 Most of the terms are 0, 1 or 2. Subsidiary sequence: Index of the first occurrence of n. Conjecture: There exists a finite M such that a(n) < M for all n.
%e A087372 a(10) = 1 as 3^1 + 20 = 23 is a prime.
%e A087372 a(23) = 3 as 3^3 +46 = 73 is a prime but 46+3 and 46+9 are not.
