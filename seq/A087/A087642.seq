%N A087642 Sequence of squarefree n such that Q(sqrt(n)) has no element with a fully periodical continued fraction of period 1.
%C A087642 Diophantine equation x^2 - n.y^2 + 4 = 0 has no solution (x,y) for a given squarefree n. Squarefree n not in the sequence A013946. Same sequence with square factors allowed is A087643.
%e A087642 3 is in the sequence because no [k,k,k,k,...] is in Q(sqrt(3))
%e A087642 5 is not in the sequence since Q(sqrt(5)) contains [1,1,1,1,...]
%Y A087642 Cf. A087643, A013946.
