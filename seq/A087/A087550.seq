%N A087550 a(n) = smallest k such that for each r, 2 <= r <= n, there exists a distinct s, n < s <= k, with the same prime signature as r.
%F A087550 For sufficiently large n, a(n) = 7^floor(log(n)/log(3)) because log(prime(2m))/log(prime(m)) is largest for m = 2. - _David Wasserman_, Jun 03 2005
%e A087550 a(7) = 19 and For numbers ( 2,3,4,5,6,7) we have the set of numbers ( 11,13,9,17,10,19) with matching prime signatures.
