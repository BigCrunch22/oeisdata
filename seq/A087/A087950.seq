%N A087950 Numerators k for which the partial quotients of the k-CF of sqrt(2) are periodic, where a k-CF is defined as the continued fraction representation having k as the constant numerator: x = q_0 + k/(q_1 + k/(q_2 + k/(q_3 +...))).
%C A087950 It is well-known that quadratic numbers have periodic partial quotients in simple continued fractions where the numerators are 1; it is unexpected that similar expressions of quadratics do not remain periodic for most constant numerators k>1.
