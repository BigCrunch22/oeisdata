%N A087937 Prime hypotenuse of primitive Pythagorean triangles with even short leg (or odd long leg).
%C A087937 Ordered intersection of A002144 and A081985.
%C A087937 These same triangles have the property that sqrt(h+c) = t,  where h = a(n), c is the even short leg, t is an integer and the odd long leg is an odd multiple of t, but it appears there are no cases where that multiple is 1, in contrast with the similar property that applies to the triangles of A087937. Also see A008846.  - _Richard R. Forberg_, May 11 2016
