%N A087403 a(n) = smallest prime of the form 10*K(n) + 1, where K is a number obtained by concatenation of n with itself, or 0 if no such prime exists.
%C A087403 Conjecture: No term is zero.
%C A087403 Next term a(22) is too large (121 digits) to include in sequence. - _Ray Chandler_, Sep 23 2003
%C A087403 From _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Jan 07 2015: (Start)
%C A087403 The conjecture is not true. There exist many numbers n such that a(n)=0.
%C A087403 By using the theorem and its corollary mentioned in the comments lines of the sequence A086766, we can prove that for m = 2, 3, ..., 275 a(10^m)=0.
%C A087403 What is the smallest odd prime p, such that (10^(p^2)-1)/(10^p-1) is a prime number (a(10^(p-1)) is nonzero)?
%C A087403 What is the smallest integer m, such that m > 1 and a(10^m) is nonzero?
%C A087403 Conjecture: If n is not of the form 10^m then a(n) is nonzero.
%C A087403 (End)
%e A087403 a(2) = 2221 is a prime but 21 and 221 are composite.
