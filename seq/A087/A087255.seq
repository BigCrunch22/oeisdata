%N A087255 Number of different initial values for 3x+1 trajectories of which the largest term appearing during the iteration equals n.

%e A087255 a(2k+1)=a(4k+2)=a(16k+12)=0 because larger values appear in iteration: 6k+4, 6k+4, and 18k+16, respectively. Exception: a(1)=a(2)=1.
%e A087255 Some outstanding cases: a(9232)=1579, a(13120)=75.
