%N A087729 Let X be the poset of finite subsets of the positive integers. The sequence is the number of downsets in X of cardinality n modulo equivalence by permutations of the positive integers.
%C A087729 a(21) took about 78 hours to compute on a fast DEC alpha (using Magma).
%e A087729 a(5) = 2 because the only example up to permutation are {{},{1},{2},{1,2},{3}} {{},{1},{2},{3},{4}}.
