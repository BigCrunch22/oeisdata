%N A087583 Distinct primes such that the absolute values of successive differences are distinct palindromes. a(n+1) is chosen to be < a(n) if such a prime exists, minimizing a(n)-a(n+1); otherwise the minimal a(n+1) > a(n) is chosen.
%C A087583 The sequence of absolute differences is 1,2,6,4,22,8,66,44.... Conjecture: this sequence is infinite and contains every even palindrome.
%e A087583 a(3) = 11: |11-5| = 6, a palindrome. The primes < 5 are excluded because they have already occurred in the sequence. 7 is excluded because |7-5| = 2 has already occurred as a difference.
