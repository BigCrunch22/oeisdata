%N A087985 a(n) = prime(x) is the smallest prime such that 1+n*prime(x) is divisible by prime(x+1), or 0 if no such prime exists.
%C A087985 Two unsolved problems:
%C A087985 1. Given arbitrary n, does there exist an m such that 1 + n*prime(x) = m*prime(x+1) is solvable? For several n (e.g., n = 17, 24, 26, 35, 41, 50, 51, 54, 87) a search up to x=10000000 did not provide a prime(x) solution.
%C A087985 2. If a solution exists, then the number of solutions is believed to be finite. E.g., at n=2122, 8 solutions were found after an extensive search {prime(x)} = {2, 19, 23, 37, 89, 433, 4241, 7621}.
%F A087985 a(n) = Min{prime(x); (1 + n*prime(x)) mod prime(x+1) = 0}; a(n) = p; 1 + n*p = m*q where {p, q} are smallest consecutive primes satisfying relation belonging to n.
%e A087985 n=1: 1 + 1*p = q is satisfied by the consecutive prime pair {2,3}; a(1)=2.
%e A087985 n=2: 1 + 2*p = m*q, no solution.
%e A087985 n=6: 1 + 6*p = m*q is satisfied first by {p,q} = {19,23} because 6*19 + 1 = 115 = 5*23.
%e A087985 It is provable that there are arbitrarily large n to which (a finite number of) solutions exist.
