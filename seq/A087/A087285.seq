%N A087285 Possible differences between a cube and the next smaller square.
%C A087285 Sequence and program were provided by _Ralf Stephan_ Aug 28 2003.
%C A087285 Comment from _David W. Wilson_, Jan 05 2009: I believe there is an algorithm for solving x^3 - y^2 = k, which should have a finite number of solutions for any k. That means that we should in principle be able to compute this sequence.
%C A087285 Up to the initial 0 in A165288, these two sequences appear to be the same, but according to its current definition, A165288 should be the same as the (different) sequence A229618 = the range of the sequence A181138 (= least k>0 such that n^2+k is a cube): If n^2+k=y^3 is the smallest cube above n^2, then n^2 is not necessarily the largest square below y^3. E.g., 18 is in A181138 and A229618, since 9+18=27 is the least cube above 9=3^2, but 25=5^2 is the largest square below 27. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 05 2013
%D A087285 See under A081121.
%e A087285 a(1)=2 because the next smaller square below 3^3=27 is 5^2=25.
