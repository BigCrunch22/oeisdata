%N A087325 Numbers k such that k and its 10's complement both have the same prime signature.
%C A087325 Conjecture: (1) Sequence is infinite. (2) For every prime signature there corresponds a term in this sequence.
%C A087325 From _Robert Israel_, Jul 02 2024: (Start)
%C A087325 Conjecture (2) is false: k and its 10's complement can't both have prime signature p^m where m is even.
%C A087325 If k is a term, then so is 10 * k.
%C A087325 It appears that the first term with m prime factors, counted with multiplicity, is 3 * 10^((m-1)/2) if m is odd and 132 * 10^((m-4)/2) if m >= 4 is even. (End)
