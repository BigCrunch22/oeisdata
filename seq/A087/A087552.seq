%N A087552 a(1) = 1, then the smallest prime divisor of A065447(n) not included earlier.
%C A087552 Conjecture: Every prime is a member and this is a rearrangement of the noncomposite numbers.
%C A087552 Proof of conjecture: primes 2=a(1) and 5=a(3) are terms, while any other prime divides infinitely many numbers of the form A002275([(n+1)/2]) = (10^[(n+1)/2]-1)/9, which in turn divide A065447(n). Thus every prime will sooner or later appear as a(n). - _Max Alekseyev_, Jul 03 2019
%e A087552 a(6) = 29; smallest prime divisor of 100111000011111000000 not included earlier is 29. The prime divisors are 2, 3, 5, 29, 37, 97 and 106872959.
