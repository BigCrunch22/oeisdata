%N A087604 Smallest k such that n times concatenation of k with itself followed by a 3 is a prime, or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A087604 Trivially a(3n) = 0. Conjecture: no other term is zero.
%C A087604 Either a(13)=0 or a(13)>36. This sequence contains no positive multiples of 3. If a(m) is of the form bbb...b (repeated k times) then a(km) <= b. - _Sam Alexander_, Oct 20 2003
%e A087604 a(5) = 4 as 444443 is a prime. but 111113,222223,333333 are not.
