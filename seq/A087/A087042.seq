%N A087042 Decimal expansion of a number x such that adding Pi to each of the partial quotients of the continued fraction of x evaluates to x+3.
%C A087042 The continued fraction of x is [0; 3, 2, 1, 26, 1, 2, 10, 1, 2, 1, 31, ...]; adding Pi to each partial quotient results in [0+Pi; 3+Pi, 2+Pi, 1+Pi, 26+Pi, 1+Pi, 2+Pi, 10+Pi, 1+Pi, 2+Pi, ...] = [3; 3, 2, 1, 26, 1, 2, 10, 1, 2, 1, 31, 1, ...] = x+3.
