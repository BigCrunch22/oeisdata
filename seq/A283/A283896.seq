%N A283896 Relative of Hofstadter Q-sequence: a(-88) = 89, a(-87) = 2; thereafter a(n) = a(n-a(n-1)) + a(n-a(n-2)).
%C A283896 In calculating terms of this sequence, use the convention that a(n)=0 for n<=-89.
%C A283896 Sequences like this are more naturally considered with the first nonzero term in position 1. But this sequence would then begin with 89 terms consisting entirely of alternating 2 and 89.
%C A283896 This sequence has exactly 2467 terms, since a(2467)=0 and computing a(2468) would refer to itself.
