%N A283189 Number of oriented circulant graphs of order n up to Cayley isomorphism.
%C A283189 This sequence may be incorrect, but for the moment I don't think so. (Even if wrong it could represent something else.) In particular, this sequence should agree with A060966 for all squarefree n. For nonsquarefree n this sequence is allowed to be greater.
%C A283189 An oriented graph is a directed graph in which there is at most one edge between any two vertices. (A directed graph can have one in each direction.)
%C A283189 Two circulant graphs are Cayley isomorphic if there is a d, which is necessarily prime to n, that transforms through multiplication modulo n the step values of one graph into those of the other.
%C A283189 Ideally this sequence should be to A060966 as A056391 is to A049297.

%e A283189 Case n=8:
%e A283189 Only 1, 3, 5, 7 are prime to 8.
%e A283189 Multiplication module 8 is described by the following multiplication table.
%e A283189 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 => (1)(2)(3)[4](5)(6)(7) => 6 => 3^3 => 27
%e A283189 3 6 1 4 7 2 5 => (1 3)[2 6][4](5 7)    => 2 => 3^1 =>  3
%e A283189 5 2 7 4 1 6 3 => (1 5)(2)(3 7)[4](6)   => 4 => 3^2 =>  9
%e A283189 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 => [1 7][2 6][3 5][4]    => 0 => 3^0 =>  1
%e A283189 Each row of the multiplication table can be viewed as a permutation and together these form a commutative group on 4 elements. In this case the group is isomorphic to the cyclic group C_4. Each permutation can be represented in cycle notation. However, only those cycles that do not include both a value and its negative can be used to form symmetrical solutions. In the above calculation, square brackets have been used to denote excluded cycles. Each remaining pair introduces a factor of 3 corresponding to no edge, or an edge in one of two directions. Putting everything together with Burnsides's lemma gives a(8) = (27 + 3 + 9 + 1)/4 = 10.
%e A283189 The corresponding step sets (one from each equivalence class) are:
%e A283189 {}, {1}, {2}, {1,2}, {1,-2}, {1,3}, {1,-3}, {1,2,3}, {1,2,-3}, {1,-2,-3}.
