%N A283423 Prime power pseudoperfect numbers: numbers m > 1 such that 1/m + Sum 1/p^k = 1, where the sum is over the prime powers p^k | m.
%C A283423 Since primary pseudoperfect numbers (A054377) must be squarefree, it follows that primary pseudoperfect numbers are contained in this sequence.
%C A283423 This sequence contains all powers of 2. With the exception of the powers of 2, every prime power pseudoperfect number is a pseudoperfect number (A005835).
%C A283423 Every number in A073935 is a prime power pseudoperfect number (note: this sequence and A073935 agree for many terms but eventually differ starting at 23994 the 38th term of this sequence).
%C A283423 The number 2^k(2^k+1) is the sequence whenever 2^k+1 is a Fermat prime (A019434).

%e A283423 m = 18 is in the sequence because 1/18 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/9 = 1.
%e A283423 m = 12 is NOT in the sequence because 1/12 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/3 != 1.
