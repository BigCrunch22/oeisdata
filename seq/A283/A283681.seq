%N A283681 Unique sequence with a(1)=1, a(2)=2, representing an array read by antidiagonals in which the i-th row is this sequence itself multiplied by i.
%C A283681 Any integer greater than 1 appears infinitely many times.
%C A283681 In particular, any n appears at the position (n^2 + n)/2. For prime n > 2, this is its first appearance; for composite n, it is not the first.
%C A283681 2 appears at the positions 2, 3, 4, 7, 22, 232, 26797, ... (A007501(n) + 1).
%C A283681 When the sequence is considered as an array, any prime n appears only in the first row (infinitely many times) and in the first column (once).

%F A283681 a((n^2+n)/2)=n.
%e A283681 The sequence begins: 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 3, 2, 4, 6, 4, ...
%e A283681 It represents a rectangular array read by downward antidiagonals. The first row of the array is this very sequence itself. The second row is this sequence multiplied by 2, and so on:
