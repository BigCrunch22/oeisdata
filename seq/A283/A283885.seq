%N A283885 Relative of Hofstadter Q-sequence: a(n) = max(0, n+3442) for n <= 0; a(n) = a(n-a(n-1)) + a(n-a(n-2)) + a(n-a(n-3)) for n > 0.
%C A283885 Sequences like this are more naturally considered with the first nonzero term in position 1. But this sequence would then match A000027 for its first 3442 terms.
%C A283885 Most terms in this sequence appear in long period-5 quasilinear runs. These runs are separated by 11943 other terms, and each run is approximately six times as long as the previous.
%C A283885 The first such run that falls into a predictable pattern begins at index 90682, though there are other similar patterns earlier.
