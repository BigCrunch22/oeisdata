%N A283555 Even numbers that cannot be expressed as p+3, p+5, or p+7, with p prime.
%C A283555 Any even number 2n which fails the Goldbach condition (i.e., is not expressible as the sum of two primes) cannot be a prime plus 3 (by definition), but it must also be the case that the two even numbers immediately smaller than 2n (i.e., 2n-2 and 2n-4) also cannot be a prime plus 3, because if they were, 2n would be a prime plus 5 or a prime plus 7 and would satisfy Goldbach. Thus any even number which fails the Goldbach condition must fall in this sequence. Note: none of the given members of the sequence fails Goldbach.
