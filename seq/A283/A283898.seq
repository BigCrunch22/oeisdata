%N A283898 Relative of Hofstadter Q-sequence: a(-311) = 312, a(-310) = 4, a(-309) = 312, a(-308) = 4; thereafter a(n) = a(n-a(n-1)) + a(n-a(n-2)).
%C A283898 In calculating terms of this sequence, use the convention that a(n)=0 for n<=-312.
%C A283898 Sequences like this are more naturally considered with the first nonzero term in position 1. But this sequence would then begin with 312 terms consisting entirely of alternating 4 and 312.
%C A283898 This sequence has exactly 6632 terms, since a(6632)=0 and computing a(6633) would refer to itself.
