%N A283105 Numbers that are an integer multiple of the mean of their smallest and largest nontrivial divisors.
%C A283105 No prime is in the sequence since there are no nontrivial divisors of a prime.
%C A283105 The sequence includes every number that is the square of a prime.
%C A283105 It is easy to show that the other terms are of the form (2p-1)*p^2 where p and 2p-1 are prime. Therefore, the mean of the two divisors in question is always an integer.

%e A283105 4 is in the sequence because its smallest nontrivial divisor is 2, its largest nontrivial divisor is 2, and their mean is 2.
%e A283105 45 is in the sequence because its smallest nontrivial divisor is 3, its largest nontrivial divisor is 15, and their mean is 9, a divisor of 45.
%e A283105 10 is not in the sequence because it is not an integral multiple of 7/2, the mean of 2 and 5.
