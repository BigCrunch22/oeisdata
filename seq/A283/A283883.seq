%N A283883 Relative of Hofstadter Q-sequence: a(n) = max(0, n+117) for n <= 0; a(n) = a(n-a(n-1)) + a(n-a(n-2)) for n > 0.
%C A283883 Sequences like this are more naturally considered with the first nonzero term in position 1. But this sequence would then match A000027 for its first 117 terms.
%C A283883 This sequence has exactly 3346939303954 terms (of positive index). a(3346939303954) = 0, so an attempt to calculate a(3346939303955) would refer to itself.
