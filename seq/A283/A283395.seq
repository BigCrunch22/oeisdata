%N A283395 Squarefree numbers m congruent to 1 modulo 4 such that the fundamental unit of the field Q(sqrt(m)) has the form x+y*sqrt(m) with x, y integers.
%C A283395 Squarefree integers m congruent to 1 modulo 4 such that the minimal solution of the Pell equation x^2 - d*y^2 = +-4 has both x and y even.
%C A283395 The sequence contains the squarefree numbers congruent to 5 modulo 8 that are not in A107997.
%C A283395 This sequence union A107997 = A039955.
%C A283395 This sequence contains all numbers of the form 4*k^2+1 (k > 1) that are squarefree.

%e A283395 33 is in the sequence since the fundamental unit of the field Q(sqrt(33)) is 23+4*sqrt(33).
%e A283395 53 is not in the sequence since the fundamental unit of the field Q(sqrt(53)) is 3+omega, where omega = (1+sqrt(53))/2.
