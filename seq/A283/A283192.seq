%N A283192 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct terms such that the derived sequence s(n)=CarrylessSum{k=1..n}a(k) contains only distinct terms, where CarrylessSum is the analog of summation for carryless addition.
%C A283192 This sequence is a permutation of the natural numbers (with inverse A283194 and fixed points A283206):
%C A283192 - for any k>0, 10^(k-1) is the first k-digit number appearing in this sequence, and the corresponding partial carryless sum is also the first k-digit number appearing in A283193,
%C A283192 - all powers of 10 appear in this sequence, in increasing order,
%C A283192 - if a(m)=10^k, and the least value not yet seen in this sequence, say v, is smaller than 10^k, then a(m+1)=v,
%C A283192 - hence each natural number will eventually appear in this sequence.
