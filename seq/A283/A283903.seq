%N A283903 Relative of Hofstadter Q-sequence.
%C A283903 This sequence is defined by a(n) = 0 for n <= 0; a(1) = 11, a(2) = 20, a(3) = 6, a(4) = 6, a(5) = 6, a(6) = 20, a(7) = 11, a(8) = 20, a(9) = 6, a(10) = 6, a(11) = 6, a(12) = 20, a(13) = 11, a(14) = 6, a(15) = 12, a(16) = 12, a(17) = 12, a(18) = 20; thereafter a(n) = a(n-a(n-1)) + a(n-a(n-2)).
%C A283903 Similar to Hofstadter's Q-sequence A005185 but with different starting values.
%C A283903 For as long as it exists, this sequence has a similar structure to A272160. That sequence consists of five interleaved sequences: four chaotic sequences and a sequence of all 4's. This sequence consists of six interleaved sequences: five chaotic sequences and a sequence of all 11's.
%C A283903 If the 20's in the initial condition are each replaced by larger numbers, the general structure of this sequence does not change.
%C A283903 This sequence has exactly 2179 terms, since a(2179)=0 and computing a(2180) would refer to itself.
