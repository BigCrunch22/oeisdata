%N A283502 Number of distinct subword complexity profiles for purely periodic binary infinite words of period n.
%C A283502 The subword complexity function p_i(x) maps i to the number of distinct contiguous blocks (aka subwords, aka factors) of length i in an infinite word x. The subword complexity profile of an infinite word x is the infinite list (p_1 (x), p_2 (x), p_3 (x), ...).   For a purely periodic infinite word x, of period n, it suffices to consider the finite list (p_1 (x), p_2 (x), ..., p_n (x)).  Furthermore, if x = www... with w of length n, it suffices to consider the list (p_1 (ww), p_2 (ww), ..., p_n (ww)).
%e A283502 For period n = 5, there are exactly three distinct subword complexity profiles:  (1,1,1,...) corresponding to the word 000...; (2,3,4,5,5,5,...) corresponding to the word 000010000100001...; and
%e A283502 (2,4,5,5,5,...) corresponding to the word 000110001100011... .
