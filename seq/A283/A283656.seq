%C A283656 It is possible to show there are infinitely many Carmichael numbers with the property. In fact this follows with a small modification of the original proof of the infinitude of the Carmichael numbers. It seems harder though to prove that there are infinitely many non-Carmichaels with the property, though undoubtedly it's true. - Carl Pomerance, Mar 24 2017
