%N A283144 Partial sums of A283131.
%C A283144 There appears to be (on average) slightly more 1 (forward steps) than -1 (backward steps) in A283131: the partial sums keep slowly increasing (as a global trend), though non-monotically.
%C A283144 The average (from 1 to n) of the partial sums keeps increasing (as a global trend), though non-monotically. Furthermore, it appears that the average (from 1 to n) of partial sums is always positive.
%C A283144 Average (from 1 to n) of the partial sums:
%C A283144   1 to 10000:  2.674
%C A283144   1 to 20000:  5.908
%C A283144   1 to 30000:  8.866
%C A283144   1 to 40000:  9.1975
%C A283144   1 to 50000: 10.511
%C A283144 Those averages seem to be asymptotic to some strictly increasing concave [yet unknown] function.
%C A283144 The first negative partial sum is a(103) = -1.
