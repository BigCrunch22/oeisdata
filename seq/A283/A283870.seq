%N A283870 For all n, the set consisting of the terms {a(1), a(2), a(3), ..., a(n)} has an odd number of digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.
%C A283870 The sequence is started with a(1) = 1 and always extended with the smallest integer not yet present and not leading to a contradiction.
%e A283870 The set consisting of the first 20 terms is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99,101,1001}; we count three 0's, seven 1's, three 2's, three 3's, three 4's, etc. All those quantities of digits are odd numbers.
