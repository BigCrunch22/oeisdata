%N A283430 Starting with a(1) = 1, a(n) = smallest nonnegative integer not yet in the sequence such that the digits of a(n-1) and a(n) together are all distinct except for one digit that appears twice.
%e A283430 The terms a(5) = 11, a(6) = 3 are allowed since in both terms altogether the digit 1 appears twice. On the contrary, a(n-1) = 11, a(n) = 12 are not allowed since the digit 1 appears three times. Also a(n-1) = 11, a(n) = 22 are not allowed since two digits (not one) appear twice.
