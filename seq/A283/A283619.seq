%N A283619 a(n) = (conjectured) smallest positive integer k which is neither of the form p + n^x nor of the form p - n^x with x >= 0 and p prime, where gcd(k, n) = 1 and gcd(k^2-1, n-1) = 1.
%C A283619 The definition is similar to that for A123159, but considering "p + n^x" and "p - n^x".
%C A283619 What does "conjectured" mean? A positive integer k is a candidate if:
%C A283619 1) gcd(k, n) = 1,
%C A283619 2) gcd(k^2-1, n-1) = 1,
%C A283619 3) every term in the sequence k + n^x is divisible by one of the prime numbers of a covering set,
%C A283619 4) all numbers of the form k - n^x are composite, k > n^x + 1, x >= 0.
%C A283619 The main problem is to prove that the given terms are indeed correct.
%C A283619 A quick search showed that a(8) = 47, a(14) = 11, a(20) = 13, a(27) = 512, a(29) = 26, a(32) = 23, a(34) = 99.
%C A283619 This is an interesting sequence: it leads to new classes of numbers. For example, the integer 30666137 is probably the smallest number that is simultaneously a Polignac number and a Sierpinski number.
