%N A283717 Number of distinct subsets S of {t,t+1,...,m-1}, t = ceiling(m/2), such that number of distinct symbols in the "most general word" of length m having its periods a superset of (S union {m}) is m-n, for m >= 2n.
%C A283717 The period of a word w is the least positive integer p such that w[i] = w[i+p] over all i for which this indexing is defined. The "most general word" is over an arbitrary alphabet that can be taken to be {1,2,...,m}. For example, the "most general word" of length 10 with periods {6,9,10} is 1231451231.
%e A283717 For n = 5 the four possible sets of periods are {m-5}, {m-1,m-4}, {m-2,m-3}, and {m-1,m-2,m-3}. The corresponding "most general words" are 123...(m-5)12345, 1231456...(m-5)1231, 1112345...(m-5)111, 1112345...(m-5)111, all of which have largest element m-5.
