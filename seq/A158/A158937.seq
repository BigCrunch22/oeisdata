%N A158937 Numbers of the form x^2+3y^2 where x and y are positive integers (with repetitions).
%C A158937 Least integer m with exactly n repetitions, {m,n}: {4,1},{91,2},{28,3},{196,4},{31213,5},{364,6}, {9604,7},{53599,8},{2548,9},{470596,10}.
%C A158937 This is an important quadratic form with a small determinant, so a list of its values with repetition is of interest. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 02 2011
