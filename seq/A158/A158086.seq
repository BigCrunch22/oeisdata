%N A158086 Number of occurrences of n as an entry in rows <= 2n of Losanitsch's triangle (A034851).
%C A158086 For n = 1 to 1000, the only values of a(n) are 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and infinity.
%e A158086 a(4) = 5 because 4 occurs five times in Losanitsch's triangle: the first time at row 4, column 2, being the sum of the two 2's in the row above; and at column 1 of rows 7 and 8, which are symmetrically duplicated at row 7, column 6 and row 8, column 7.
