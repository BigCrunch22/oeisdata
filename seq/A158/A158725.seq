%N A158725 Non-repdigit composite numbers not divisible by 2, 3, 5 or 11.
%C A158725 Non-repdigit composite numbers ending in 1, 3, 7 or 9, with digital root not a multiple of 3 and whose alternate digit sums do not differ by a multiple of 11.
%C A158725 The "compositeness" of larger entries of the sequence is not obvious right away or deducible by mere inspection, and hence these terms readily lend themselves to be (erroneously) suspected as primes to the casual glance.
%C A158725 This differs from the corresponding sequence without the repunit condition starting at a(1351) = 11123 rather than 11111. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Sep 08 2012
