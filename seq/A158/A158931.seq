%N A158931 a(n) = smallest number m such that m^2 and n^2 share no common digits and m^2 and n^2 together use all 10 digits, a(n) = 0 if no such m exists.
%e A158931 a(1)=m=45136 because m^2=2037258496 and n^2=1 have no common digits and together use all 10 decimal digits;
%e A158931 a(2)=m=36137 because m^2=1305882769 and n^2=4 have no common digits and together use all 10 decimal digits;
%e A158931 first zero is a(304)=0 because 304^2=92416, "free" digits are {0,3,5,7,8} none of them can be last digit of square (zero can but this does not matter, also 5 can but only in combination 25 while 2 is not available for m^2);
%e A158931 similarly, a(353)=0 because 353^2=124609, and free digits are {3,5,7,8}. Values of n for which m=0 are in A158932.
