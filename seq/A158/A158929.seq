%N A158929 a(n) is the smallest integer not yet in the sequence with no common base-4 digit with a(n-1).
%C A158929 Numbers of A031945 do not appear in this sequence.
%e A158929 The fifth term cannot be 5(base10)=11(base4), 6(base10)=12(base4), 7(base10)=13(base4), 8(base10)=20(base4) or 9(base10)=21(base4) because each of them has either a 0 or a 1 in its base-4 representation, which it would have in common with 4(base10)=10(base4). So a(5)=10(base10)=22(base4) which displays only digits of 2 in base 4.
%Y A158929 Cf. A067581 (base-10), A158928 (base-3), A158930 (base-5).
