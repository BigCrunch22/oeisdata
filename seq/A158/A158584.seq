%N A158584 Erroneous version of A079866.
%C A158584 We do not begin with the unit 1 because it has no prime factors. Conjecture: The sequence contains the set of prime numbers more than once.
%F A158584 The geometric mean is the n-th root of the product of n numbers.
%F A158584 Gm = (a(1)*a(2)*...*a(n))^(1/n).
%e A158584 12=2*2*3 has 3 factors; 12^(1/3) = 2.289428... so 2 is in the 11th position in the sequence.
