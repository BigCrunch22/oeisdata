%N A158323 Numbers that are the greater of twin primes such that the number of odd digits of the lesser prime equals the number of prime digits of the greater prime.
%C A158323 The greater member of a twin prime pair such that the count of its prime digits is equal to the count of odd digits in the smaller member. - _R. J. Mathar_, May 19 2010

%e A158323 29 and 31 are twin primes; 29 has one odd digit (9) and 31 has one prime digit (3), so 31 is a term.
%e A158323 41 and 43 are twin primes; 41 has one odd digit (1) and 43 has one prime digit (3), so 43 is a term.
%e A158323 71 and 73 are twin primes; 71 has two odd digits (7 and 1) and 73 has two prime digits (7 and 3), so 73 is a term.
