%N A158971 a(n) is the smallest number m such that m n's + 1 is prime and zero if there is no such m.
%C A158971 I. If n is an odd number greater than 1 then a(n)=0. II. If n is greater
%C A158971 than 4 and mod(m,10)=4 then a(n)=0. III. If n+1 is prime the a(n)=1.
%e A158971 20+1 & 2020+1 aren't prime but 202020+1 is prime so a(20)=3. If n>4 and
%e A158971 mod(n,10)=4 then there is no number m such that m n's + 1 is prime because
%e A158971 5 divides all such numbers so a(n)=0.
