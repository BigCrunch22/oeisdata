%N A158972 a(n) is the smallest number m such that m n's - 1 is prime and zero if there is no such m.
%C A158972 I. If m=1 or m is an odd number greater than 3 then a(m)=0. II. If m is greater
%C A158972 than 6 and mod(m,10)=6 then a(m)=0. III. If n-1 is prime the a(n)=1.
%C A158972 a(64) is greater than 4000.
%e A158972 2-1, 22-1 & 222-1 aren't prime and 2222-1 is prime so a(2)=4. There is no m
%e A158972 such that m 16's -1 is prime because 5 divides all such numbers, so a(16)=0.
