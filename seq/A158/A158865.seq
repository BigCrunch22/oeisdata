%N A158865 Smallest maximal excess attained by an equivalence class of Hadamard matrices of order 4n.
%C A158865 The excess of a {-1,1} matrix is the sum of its elements. The maximal excess of an equivalence class of Hadamard matrices (cf. A007299) is the largest excess attained by a member of the class. The largest maximal excess of any equivalence class is given by A004118.
