%N A158794 Multiples of 4 which are not the sum of seven nonnegative cubes.
%C A158794 Boklan and Elkies: It is conjectured that every integer N>454 is the sum of seven nonnegative cubes. We prove the conjecture when N is a multiple of 4.
%C A158794 Elkies [2010]: It is conjectured that every integer N>454 is the sum of seven nonnegative cubes. We prove the conjecture when N is congruent to 2 mod 4. This result, together with a recent proof for 4|N, shows that the conjecture is true for all even N. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Sep 22 2010
