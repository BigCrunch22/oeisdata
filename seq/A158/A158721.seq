%N A158721 Primes p such that (p + 1)/3 + p is prime.
%C A158721 Original title was "Primes p such that Ceiling[p/3] + p is prime." If p = 1 mod 6, then p/3 falls between 2 and 3 mod 6, and the ceiling function bumps it up to 3 mod 6. Therefore ceiling(p/3) + p = 4 mod 6, which is an even number greater than 2 and therefore obviously composite.
%C A158721 Therefore the ceiling function is only necessary when the primality testing function requires an integer argument.
%C A158721 And so, aside from 2, all terms are congruent to 5 mod 6.
%C A158721 Set q = (p + 1)/3 + p, then (p + 1)/(q + 1) = 3/4. If this sequence is proven infinite, that would prove two specific cases of the Schinzel-Sierpi≈Ñski conjecture regarding rational numbers. - _Alonso del Arte_, Mar 12 2016
%e A158721 2 is in the sequence because (2 + 1)/3 + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3, which is prime.
%e A158721 5 is in the sequence because (5 + 1)/3 + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7, which is prime.
%e A158721 11 is not in the sequence because (11 + 1)/3 + 11 = 15 = 3 * 5.
