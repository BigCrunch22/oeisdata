%N A307536 Self referencing version of the "Kimberling shuffle" sequence (see Comments).
%C A307536 If the first row of the expulsion array is replaced by this sequence, and the rows are "shuffled" then the sequence reappears in the diagonal.
%C A307536 For integer n >= 1 define the set [n]={x; A^r(x)=n}U{y; B^r(y)=n}; (r=0,1,2,3..., A^0(n)=B^0(n)=n), where A=A007063 and B=A006852 (mutual inverses). This set includes n, together with all numbers linked to n by A and B. If a number m is in [n], then [m]=[n], therefore we name the set by its least element k, which takes the following values: 1,2,4,6,8,11,13,14,19,21,26,27,40,45,48,50,51,57,63,... Assuming every n is a term in A, the collection of distinct sets [k] is a partition of the natural numbers, and this sequence is constructed by replacing in the first row of the original array, every number n in [k], with k.
%C A307536 A lexicographically earliest version can be obtained from this sequence by replacing any term > all preceding terms by k+1, where k is the greatest term seen so far. Thus: 1,2,2,3,2,4,4,5,2,2,6,2,7,8,4,4,2,6,9,2,10,4,2,2,2,11,...
%C A307536 From _Lars Blomberg_, Apr 27 2019: (Start)
%C A307536 Starting with some k value and extending in both directions using A and B results in a "valley" with k at the bottom and often sub-valleys on the hillsides (larger than k). (See the document referenced in A038807 for an illustration.)
%C A307536 So the k sequence is computed by selecting the smallest value not yet seen and iterate as far as possible, then select the next value not seen, etc.
%C A307536 However, while it seems that A and B values goes toward infinity, it is not known whether a known valley will eventually connect to another known valley, leading to a different set of k values.
%C A307536 The DATA is based on iterating A and B until the value > 10^8. (End)
