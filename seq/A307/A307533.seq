%N A307533 Primes p such that p+2 has exactly two distinct prime factors.
%C A307533 (13,31), (37,73), (157,751), (199,991) are pairs of emirps belonging to this sequence such that the lesser term of the pair is the reverse of the greater. Are there infinitely many such pairs?
%C A307533 Are there infinitely many triples in the sequence like (61,67,73) and (251,257,263), that is, infinitely many a(n) such that a(n+1)=a(n)+6 and a(n+2)=a(n)+12?
%C A307533 The triples found so far are (61,67,73), (251,257,263) and (367,373,379). The first terms of the triples found are 61, 251 and 367, which belong to the sequence A038107.
