%N A307407 Irregular table read by rows: rows list terms that map to the nodes in the graph of the "3x+1" (or Collatz) problem.
%C A307407 The construction is similar to that in A322469. The sequence is the flattened form of an irregular table S(i, j) (see the example below) which has rows i >= 1 consisting of subsequences of varying length.
%C A307407 Like Truemper (cf. link), we denote the mapping x -> 2*x by "m" ("multiply"), the mapping x -> (x - 1)/3 by "d" ("divide"), and the combined mapping "dm" x -> (x - 1)/3 * 2 by "s" ("squeeze").  The d mapping is defined only if it is possible, that is, if x - 1 is divisible by 3. We write m, d and s as infix operation words, for example "4 mms 10", and we use exponents for repeated operations, for example "mms^2 = mmss".
%C A307407 Row i in table S is constructed by the following algorithm: Start with 6 * i - 2 in column j = 1. The following columns j are defined in groups of four by the operations:
%C A307407   k   j=4*k+2    j=4*k+3    j=4*k+4    j=4*k+5
%C A307407   --------------------------------------------------
%C A307407   0   mm         dmm        mmd        dmmd
%C A307407   1   mms        dmms       mmsd       dmmsd
%C A307407   2   mms^2      dmms^2     mms^2d     dmms^2d
%C A307407   ...
%C A307407   k   mms^k      dmms^k     mm(s^k)d   dmm(s^k)d
%C A307407 The construction for the row terminates at the first column where a d operation is no longer possible. This point is always reached. This can be proved by the observation that, for any row i in S, there is a unique mapping x -> (x + 2)/6 of the terms in column 1, 2, 5, 9, 13, ... 4*m+1 to the terms in row i of table T in A322469. The row construction process in A322469 stops, therefore it stops also in the sequence defined here.
%C A307407 Conjecture: The sequence is a permutation of the positive numbers.
