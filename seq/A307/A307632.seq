%N A307632 Index of first occurrence of n-th prime in A307720.
%C A307632 It follows from the definition of A307720 that if p = k-th prime, k>1 and k odd, and q = (k+1)st prime, then the first time p appears in the sequence is at the start of a subsequence (p,1) [(p-1)/2 times], p, (1,q) [{q+1)/2 times].
%C A307632 For example, the fifth prime (11) first appears in A307720 at step 1374 at the start of the subsequence 11, 1, 11, 1, 11, 1, 11, 1, 11, 1, 11, 1, 13, 1, 13, 1, 13, 1, 13, 1, 13, 1, 13, 1, 13.
%C A307632 So q appears p+1 steps after p, which explains why the terms of the present sequence appear in pairs.
%C A307632 In fact, it appears that one can make a much stronger statement about what happens immediately after the first occurrence of p. Look at the terms in A307720 following the first 11 at step 1374. It may be that the next O(p^2) terms are forced.
