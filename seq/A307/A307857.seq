%N A307857 Number of partitions of n into 1, 2 or 3 nonprime parts.
%H A307857 <a href="/index/Par#part">Index entries for sequences related to partitions</a>
%F A307857 a(n) = c(n) + ( Sum_{i=1..floor(n/2)} c(i) * c(n-i) ) + ( Sum_{j=1..floor(n/3)} Sum_{i=j..floor(n-j)/2)} c(i) * c(j) * c(n-i-j) ), where c = A005171.
%e A307857 a(9) = 3, because 9 can be written as the sum of nonprimes with at most 3 parts in three ways: 9 = 8+1 = 4+4+1.
%e A307857 a(10) = 4, because 10 can be written as the sum of nonprimes with at most 3 parts in four ways: 10 = 9+1 = 6+4 = 8+1+1.
%e A307857 a(11) = 3, because 11 can be written as the sum of nonprimes with at most 3 parts in three ways: 10+1 = 9+1+1 = 6+4+1.
%e A307857 a(12) = 5, because 12 can be written as the sum of nonprimes with at most 3 parts in five ways: 12 = 8+4 = 6+6 = 10+1+1 = 4+4+4.
