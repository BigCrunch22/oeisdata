%N A307213 Divide the natural numbers into sets of successive sizes 3,4,5,6,7,...,, starting with {1,2,3}. Cycle through each set until you reach a prime; if the prime was the n-th element in its set, jump to the n-th element of the next set.
%C A307213 "Cycle" in the definition, means that if no prime is found, go back to the start of the set.
%C A307213 If a set does not contain a prime, the sequence goes into an infinite loop, but it is conjectured that this does not happen since the sets are of increasing length.
%C A307213 The sets (rather intervals) are I_j = [(j^2 + 3*j - 2)/2, j*(j + 5)/2] =[A034856(j), A095998(j)], for j >= 1. For the  number of primes in these intervals see A309121. - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Jul 13 2019

%e A307213 The first set is {1,2,3}. We look at 1 then 2. 2 is prime, and it is the second number in the set. The next set is {4,5,6,7}. So we jump to the second element, 5. 5 is also prime, so we jump to the second element of the next set, {8,9,10,11,12}, which is 9, etc. If we reach the end of a set without reaching a prime, we loop back to the first element, which is the only way for a(n) < a(n-1) to happen.
