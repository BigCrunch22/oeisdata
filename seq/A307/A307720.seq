%N A307720 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers in which, for all positive k, there are exactly k pairs of consecutive terms whose product is k.
%C A307720 All natural integers will appear sooner or later in the sequence (from the definition) - but mostly "later"! Indeed, the sequence increases very slowly: after 100000 terms the smallest term not yet present is 32.
%C A307720 Here is, in the same range, a sample of the count {term, occurrences} so far:
%C A307720 {1,192},{2,396},{3,618},{4,796},{5,1160},{6,1296},{7,2294},{8,2080},{9,2489},{10,2826},{11,3487},{12,1596},{13,2295},{14,1960},{15,2370},{16,2640},{17,4097},{18,2214},{19,4598},{20,2770},{21,3759},{22,4477},{23,5612},{24,4884},{25,5825},{26,6006},{27,6359},{28,4676},{29,5481},{30,3060},{31,1411},{32,0},{33,182},{34,0},{35,315},{36,0},{37,1221},{38,0},{39,214},{40,0},{41,1353},{42,0},{43,1183},{44,0},{45,0},{46,0},{47,1058},{48,0},{49,172},{50,0},{51,0},{52,0},{53,580},...
%C A307720 After 100000 terms, the first products that are not yet present are (the primes): 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, ... and (the composites) 118, 122, 134, ...

%C A307720 Comment from _N. J. A. Sloane_, Oct 19 2021: (Start)
%C A307720 Theorem. This sequence can also be defined by a greedy algorithm. That is, let b(1)=1, and for n >= 1, let b(n+1) be the smallest positive integer k such that m = k*b(n) has appeared at most n-1 times in the list [b(i)*b(i+1): i=1..n-1]. Then b(n) = a(n) for all n >= 1.
%C A307720 (Note that for n=1 the list is empty, and so we take k = b(1) = 1.)
%C A307720 Remark: The theorem is not obvious and requires a proof, given in a link below. "Lexicographically earliest" sequences often require some backtracking, but the point of the theorem is that no backtracking is needed here.
%C A307720 The proof also shows that there are infinitely many 1's in the sequence, and that each k appears k times in the sequence of products a(i)*a(i+1). (End)
