%N A307507 Brazilian semiprimes.
%C A307507 Comparison with A001358 (semiprimes): in this sequence, there are no squared primes apart from 121 = (11111)_3, and also 6 is missing from here since it is not Brazilian.
%C A307507 Different from the squarefree semiprimes of A006881: this sequence = {A006881 \ 6} Union {121}.
%e A307507 a(20) = 74 = 2 * 37 = (22)_36 is semiprime and Brazilian.
%e A307507 25 = 5 * 5 is semiprime and no Brazilian, and 45 = (55)_8 = (33)_14 = 3^2 * 5 is Brazilian but no semiprime.
%Y A307507 Intersection of A001358 and A125134.
%Y A307507 Cf. A006881, A190300, A196104.
