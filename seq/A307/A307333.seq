%N A307333 A fractal quaternary sequence: For all n >= 1, underline the term with index n + a(n) + 1; then the two subsequences of underlined terms and of non-underlined terms are both equal to the sequence itself.
%C A307333 This is defined to be the lexicographically earliest quaternary sequence with the following property:
%C A307333 If a(n) = 0, underline a(n+1); if a(n) = 1, underline a(n+2); if a(n) = 2, underline a(n+3); if a(n) = 3, underline a(n+4). Now, the subsequence of (once or more) underlined terms must be equal to the original sequence (copy #1), and the subsequence of non-underlined terms must also reproduce the original sequence (copy #2).

%e A307333 The sequence starts (3, 2, 1, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 0,...)
%e A307333 Instead of underlining terms, we will put parentheses around the terms we want to emphasize:
%e A307333 a(1) = 3 produces parentheses around a(1 + 4 = 5):
%e A307333 3, 2, 1, 0, (3,) 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 0,...
%e A307333 a(2) = 2 produces parentheses around a(2 + 3 = 5), which is now already done. Then,
%e A307333 a(3) = 1 produces parentheses around a(3 + 2 = 5), which is already done. Then,
%e A307333 a(4) = 0 produces parentheses around a(4 + 1 = 5), which is already done. Now,
%e A307333 a(5) = 3 produces parentheses around a(5 + 4 = 9):
%e A307333 3, 2, 1, 0, (3,) 3, 3, 3, (2), 1, 0, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 0,...
%e A307333 a(6) = 3 produces parentheses around a(6 + 4 = 10):
%e A307333 3, 2, 1, 0, (3,) 3, 3, 3, (2), (1), 0, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 0,...
%e A307333 a(7) = 3 produces parentheses around a(7 + 4 = 11):
%e A307333 3, 2, 1, 0, (3,) 3, 3, 3, (2), (1), (0), 3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 0,...
%e A307333 a(8) = 3 produces parentheses around a(8 + 4 = 12):
%e A307333 3, 2, 1, 0, (3,) 3, 3, 3, (2), (1), (0), (3), 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 0,...
%e A307333 a(9) = 2 produces parentheses around a(9 + 3 = 12) - already done. Then,
%e A307333 a(10) = 1 produces parentheses around a(10 + 2 = 12) - already done. Then,
%e A307333 a(11) = 0 produces parentheses around a(11 + 1 = 12) - already done. Then,
%e A307333 a(12) = 3 produces parentheses around a(12 + 4 = 16):
%e A307333 3, 2, 1, 0, (3,) 3, 3, 3, (2), (1), (0), (3), 3, 2, 1, (3), 3, 0,...
%e A307333 a(13) = 3 produces parentheses around a(13 + 4 = 17):
%e A307333 3, 2, 1, 0, (3,) 3, 3, 3, (2), (1), (0), (3), 3, 2, 1, (3), (3), 0,...
%e A307333 a(14) = 2 produces parentheses around a(14 + 3 = 17) - already done. Then,
%e A307333 a(15) = 1 produces parentheses around a(15 + 2 = 17) - already done. Etc.
%e A307333 We see in this small example that the parenthesized terms reproduce the initial sequence:
%e A307333 (3),(2),(1),(0),(3),(3),(3),...
%e A307333 The same is true for the subsequence of non-parenthesized terms:
%e A307333 3, 2, 1, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0,...
