%N A307024 Lexicographically earliest sequence of different terms starting with a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 2 such that two consecutive terms of opposite parity are followed by their sum; else (same parity), by the smallest term not yet in the sequence.
%C A307024 This sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A307024 The sequence starts with 1,2,3,5,4,9,13,6,19,25,7,... and we see that:
%e A307024 a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 2 being of opposite parity are followed by their sum (3);
%e A307024 a(2) = 2 and a(3) = 3 being of opposite parity are followed by their sum (5);
%e A307024 a(3) = 3 and a(4) = 5 being of the same parity are followed by the smallest term not yet in the sequence (4);
%e A307024 a(4) = 5 and a(5) = 4 being of opposite parity are followed by their sum (9);
%e A307024 a(5) = 4 and a(6) = 9 being of opposite parity are followed by their sum (13);
%e A307024 a(6) = 9 and a(7) = 13 being of the same parity are followed by the smallest term not yet in the sequence (6);
%e A307024 etc.
%Y A307024 This sequence is based on the same idea developed in A307023, but with no duplicate term: a(20) = 24 here but a(20) = 23 there.
