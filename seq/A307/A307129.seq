%N A307129 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct terms such that the sequence of digits has alternating parity, and the same holds for the digits of the sequence a(n) + a(n+1).
%C A307129 In the sequel we use S(n) = a(n) and T(n) = a(n) + a(n+1).
%C A307129 T is the sequence of the "first sums" of the successive pairs of S's adjacent terms. S(1) + S(2) = 1 + 29 = 30 and thus T(1) = 30; S(2) + S(3) = 29 + 21 = 50 and thus T(2) = 50; S(3) + S(4) = 21 + 49 = 70 and thus T(3) = 70; etc.
%C A307129 T has an entry for itself in the OEIS (A307130).
%C A307129 S and T need a lot of backtracking to be computed; this means that the last few terms of S and T might evolve. However, the first 100 terms proposed here seem correct.
%C A307129 It appears that the sequence can be computed in a greedy way, by discarding only the last term when it's impossible to find a successor for it. It also appears that the lexicographic earliest sequence following the same rules but starting with a(1) = 0 (or with a(1) = 2) is given, after this initial term, by the terms following S(11) = 258, i.e., a(2) = S(12) = 12, a(3) = S(13) = 18, etc. - _M.

%e A307129 The first terms of S are 1, 29, 21, 49, 23, 27, 25, 45, 47, 43, 258, ... and we see that the digits of S follow the pattern odd/even/odd/even...
%e A307129 The first terms of T are 30, 50, 70, 72, 50, 52, 70, 92, 90, 301, ... and we see that the digits of T follow the same odd/even/odd/even... pattern.
