%N A307951 Decimal expansion of 1 - log(2)/log(-W(-2/e^2)), where W is Lambert's W function.
%C A307951 Chang shows that a constant population of n individuals, with ancestors selected uniformly at random, converges in probability to a state where every individual leaves either no current ancestors or else is a common ancestor of all present individuals after k*log_2(n) generations, where k is this constant (see Theorem 2 in Chang link for precise statement).
