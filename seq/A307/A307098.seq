%N A307098 The primitive abundant numbers k (A071395) arranged by the decreasing values of their abundancy index sigma(k)/k.
%C A307098 Cohen proved that for any given eps > 0 there are only finitely many primitive abundant numbers k with sigma(k)/k >= 2 + eps. Thus the primitive abundant numbers can be arranged by their decreasing value of their abundancy index. In case of more than one primitive abundant number with the same abundancy index, the terms are ordered by their value.
%C A307098 Cohen calculated the first 91 terms of this sequence, all the terms with abundancy index >= 2.05 - see the link for the corresponding values of the abundancy index.
