%N A307620 Integers x such that [f(0), f(f(0)), ..., f(...f(0)...)] is a permutation of [0, 1, ..., k-1], where k is the number of digits in x and f(a) denotes the 0-based index of the first occurrence of the substring a in x.
%C A307620 Numbers with 21 digits cannot fit every number from 0 to 20 as strings. Hence this sequence cannot have any numbers with 21 digits or more, making it finite.
%C A307620 1918171615141312110 is the largest number in this sequence (see examples).
%e A307620 Consider x = 40312. f(0) = 1, f(1) = 3, f(3) = 2, f(2) = 4, f(4) = 0 and so we have visited every index of x.
%e A307620 Consider the largest number in this sequence, x = 1918171615141312110. f(0) = 18, f(18) = 2, f(2) = 15, f(15) = 8, f(8) = 3, f(3) = 13, f(13) = 12, f(12) = 14, f(14) = 10, f(10) = 17, f(17) = 4, f(4) = 11, f(11) = 16, f(16) = 6, f(6) = 7, f(7) = 5, f(5) = 9, f(9) = 1, f(1) = 0 and so we have visited every index of x.
