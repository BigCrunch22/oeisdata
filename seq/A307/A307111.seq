%N A307111 a(n) is the least primitive n-abundant number k with the largest possible abundancy index sigma(k)/k.
%C A307111 A primitive n-abundant number k is a number with sigma(k)/k > n and sigma(d)/d < n for all the proper divisors d of k.
%C A307111 Cohen proved that for any given eps > 0 there are only finitely many primitive n-abundant numbers k with sigma(k)/k >= n + eps. Thus for each n there is a maximal value of the abundancy index sigma(k)/k for primitive n-abundant numbers k. If this maximum occurs at more than one number the least of them is given in this sequence.

%e A307111 3465 is in the sequence since it is the primitive abundant (A071395) number with the largest possible abundancy index among the primitive abundant numbers: sigma(3465)/3465 = 832/385 = 2.161003... The abundancy indices of the next terms are 1248/385 = 3.241558..., 193536/46189 = 4.190088..., 642816/124729 = 5.153701...
