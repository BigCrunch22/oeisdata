%N A307339 A fractal nonary sequence: For all n >= 1, underline the term with index n + a(n) + 1; then the two subsequences of underlined terms and of non-underlined terms are both equal to the sequence itself.
%C A307339 This is defined to be the lexicographically earliest nonary sequence with the following property:
%C A307339 If a(n) = 0, underline a(n+1); if a(n) = 1, underline a(n+2); if a(n) = 2, underline a(n+3); if a(n) = 3, underline a(n+4); if a(n) = 4, underline a(n+5); if a(n) = 5, underline a(n+6); if a(n) = 6, underline a(n+7); if a(n) = 7, underline a(n+8); if a(n) = 8, underline a(n+9). Now, the subsequence of (once or more) underlined terms must be equal to the original sequence (copy #1), and the subsequence of non-underlined terms must also reproduce the original sequence (copy #2).

%e A307339 The sequence starts (8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,8,8,...)
%e A307339 Instead of underlining terms, we will put parentheses around the terms we want to emphasize:
%e A307339 a(1) = 8 produces parentheses around a(1 + 9 = 10):
%e A307339 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,(8),8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,8,8,...
%e A307339 a(2) = 7 produces parentheses around a(2 + 8 = 10), which is now already done. Then,
%e A307339 a(3) = 6 produces parentheses around a(3 + 7 = 10), which is already done. Then,
%e A307339 a(4) = 5 produces parentheses around a(4 + 6 = 10) - already done. Then,
%e A307339 a(5) = 4 produces parentheses around a(5 + 5 = 10) - already done. Then,
%e A307339 a(6) = 3 produces parentheses around a(6 + 4 = 10) - already done. Then,
%e A307339 a(7) = 2 produces parentheses around a(7 + 3 = 10) - already done. Then,
%e A307339 a(8) = 1 produces parentheses around a(8 + 2 = 10) - already done. Then,
%e A307339 a(9) = 0 produces parentheses around a(9 + 1 = 10) - already done. Then,
%e A307339 a(10) = 8 produces parentheses around a(10 + 9 = 19):
%e A307339 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,(8),8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,(7),6,5,4,3,2,1,0,8,8,...
%e A307339 a(11) = 8 produces parentheses around a(11 + 9 = 20):
%e A307339 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,(8),8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,(7),(6),5,4,3,2,1,0,8,8,...
%e A307339 a(12) = 8 produces parentheses around a(12 + 9 = 21):
%e A307339 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,(8),8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,(7),(6),(5),4,3,2,1,0,8,8,...
%e A307339 a(13) = 8 produces parentheses around a(13 + 9 = 22):
%e A307339 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,(8),8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,(7),(6),(5),(4),3,2,1,0,8,8,...
%e A307339 a(14) = 8 produces parentheses around a(14 + 9 = 23):
%e A307339 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,(8),8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,(7),(6),(5),(4),(3),2,1,0,8,8,...
%e A307339 a(15) = 8 produces parentheses around a(15 + 9 = 24):
%e A307339 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,(8),8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,(7),(6),(5),(4),(3),(2),1,0,8,8,...
%e A307339 a(16) = 8 produces parentheses around a(16 + 9 = 25):
%e A307339 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,(8),8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,(7),(6),(5),(4),(3),(2),(1),0,8,8,...
%e A307339 a(17) = 8 produces parentheses around a(17 + 9 = 26):
%e A307339 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,(8),8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,(7),(6),(5),(4),(3),(2),(1),(0),8,8,...
%e A307339 a(18) = 7 produces parentheses around a(18 + 8 = 26) - already done. Then,
%e A307339 a(19) = 6 produces parentheses around a(19 + 7 = 26) - already done. Etc.
%e A307339 We see in this small example that the parenthesized terms reproduce the initial sequence:
%e A307339 (8),(7),(6),(5),(4),(3),(2),(1),(0),...
%e A307339 The same is true for the subsequence of non-parenthesized terms:
%e A307339 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8,...
