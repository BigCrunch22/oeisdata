%N A307360 A sequence in which every divisor other than 1 is used at most three times.
%C A307360 In other words, for every k > 1, there are at most 3 multiples of k in the sequence. - _RÃ©my Sigrist_,  Apr 08 2019
%C A307360 The sequence begins at 1. The smallest integer greater than the last term which is not divisible by a divisor already used three times (excluding one) is added to the sequence.
%C A307360 Contains all prime numbers (A000040), given that the prime numbers only have the divisors of themselves and one, by definition, therefore the only divisor which could exist in the sequence already to disqualify the number from inclusion in the sequence would be the prime number itself, but a number cannot have a divisor higher than itself (the prime numbers), so given that the sequence increases, the divisor could not exist in the sequence, and any prime number would be included.
%C A307360 Terms are {1} or primes or squares of primes (A000430) or numbers of the form prime(2k + 1) * prime(2k + 2) (A089581) where k >= 0. - _David A. Corneth_, Apr 09 2019

%e A307360 For instance, 8 is not in the sequence because 2, 4, and 6 are all divisible by 2 and appear previously in the sequence. The sequence, then, skips to nine. After 9, no more numbers divisible by three appear in the sequence, given that after 3 and 6, it is the third number divisible by three to appear in the sequence.
