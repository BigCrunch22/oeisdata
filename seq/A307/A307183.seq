%N A307183 A fractal binary sequence: For all n >= 1, underline the term with index n + a(n) + 1; then the two subsequences of underlined terms and of non-underlined terms are both equal to the sequence itself.
%C A307183 This is defined to be the lexicographically earliest binary sequence with the following property:
%C A307183 If a(n) = 0, underline a(n+1); if a(n) = 1, underline a(n+2). Now, the subsequence of (once or twice) underlined terms must be equal to the original sequence (copy #1), and the subsequence of non-underlined terms must also reproduce the original sequence (copy #2).
%C A307183 From Lars Blomberg: (Start)
%C A307183 For e = (3,4,5,6,7,8,9) the first 10^e terms contain (70, 696, 6928, 69249, 693289, 6941990, 69507187, 694529637) ones. The fraction of '1's seems to be rather constant, but there are subtle differences from any regular trend.
%C A307183 Furthermore, if runs of '0's and '1's are counted, it turns out that from 10^3 terms upwards there is never more than 4 in a run of zeros and from 10^5 terms and upwards never more than 17 in a run of ones.
%C A307183 (End)
%C A307183 Ternary sequences based on the same idea are possible; the lexicographically earliest of them begins with 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1,...
%C A307183 The lexicographically earliest sequence dealing with four distinct values seems to begin with 3, 2, 1, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 0, 3, 2, 1, 3, 0, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 3, 0, 3, 3, 2, 0,...
%C A307183 etc.
%C A307183 From _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 29 2019: (Start)
%C A307183 The property can be rewritten as follows: For a given sequence a(.), let
%C A307183   U = U(a) := { k >= 2 | a(k-1) = 0 or k >= 3 and a(k-2) = 1 }
%C A307183   be the set or sequence of indices of "underlined" terms, and its complement V = V(a) := { k >= 1 | k not in U(a) } the set of indices of "non-underlined" terms.
%C A307183 Then sequence a(.) must be equal to u = (a(k))_{ k in U }, i.e., u(n) = a(U[n]), and also equal to v = (a(k))_{ k in V }, i.e., v(n) = a(V[n]).
%C A307183 In short: a(n) = a(U[n]) = a(V[n]).
%C A307183 Obviously, each of U (underlined) and V (non-underlined) must be infinite.
%C A307183 Thus a(.) cannot become constant (..., 0, 0, 0, ...) or (..., 1, 1, 1, ...).
%C A307183 Therefore a(.) cannot start (0, ...) nor (1, 1, ...), since a(k) = 0 for all k < n => a(n) = 0; and a(k) = 1 for all k < n, n >= 3 => a(n) = 1.
%C A307183 This proves that the sequence must start a = (1, 0, ...), whence U = {3, ...} and V = {1, 2, ...}.
%C A307183 This implies that we must have a(3) = a(U[1]) = u(1) = a(1) = 1, whence U = U union {3 + 2 = 5}. No smaller term can appear in U, so V = V union {4} = {1, 2, 4,...}.
%C A307183 This implies that we must have a(4) = a(V[3]) = v(3) = a(3) = 1, and U = U union {4 + 2 = 6}.
%C A307183 For any given n > 2, we can calculate a(n) in this way: either n = U[k] or n = V[k] for some k < n (because 1 is not in U and 3 is not in V), and in either case, a(n) = a(k). As we do so, we require U to contain either n+1 or n+2, and all smaller numbers not in U must be in V. Therefore, a(n) will be well defined by the property for all indices n. This shows existence *and uniqueness* of the sequence a(.). The requirement of being the lexicographically first such sequence is not needed. (End)

%e A307183 The sequence starts (1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1,...)
%e A307183 Instead of underlining terms, we will put parentheses around the terms we want to emphasize:
%e A307183 a(1) = 1 produces parentheses around a(1 + 2 = 3):
%e A307183 1,0,(1),1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,...
%e A307183 a(2) = 0 produces parentheses around a(2 + 1 = 3), which is now already done. Then,
%e A307183 a(3) = 1 produces parentheses around a(3 + 2 = 5), and
%e A307183 a(4) = 1 produces parentheses around a(4 + 2 = 6):
%e A307183 1,0,(1),1,(0),(1),1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,...
%e A307183 a(5) = 0 produces parentheses around a(5 + 1 = 6), which is already done. Then,
%e A307183 a(6) = 1 produces parentheses around a(6 + 2 = 8),
%e A307183 a(7) = 1 produces parentheses around a(7 + 2 = 9),
%e A307183 a(8) = 1 produces parentheses around a(8 + 2 = 10):
%e A307183 1,0,(1),1,(0),(1),1,(1),(0),(1),0,1,1,1,0,1,...
%e A307183 a(9) = 0 produces parentheses around a(9 + 1 = 10), which is already done. Next,
%e A307183 a(10) = 1 produces parentheses around a(10 + 2 = 12), and
%e A307183 a(11) = 0 produces parentheses around a(11 + 1 = 12) - already done:
%e A307183 1,0,(1),1,(0),(1),1,(1),(0),(1),0,(1),1,1,0,1,... Now,
%e A307183 a(12) = 1 produces parentheses around a(12 + 2 = 14),
%e A307183 a(13) = 1 produces parentheses around a(13 + 2 = 15), and
%e A307183 a(14) = 1 produces parentheses around a(14 + 2 = 16):
%e A307183 1,0,(1),1,(0),(1),1,(1),(0),(1),0,(1),1,(1),(0),(1), ..., and so on.
%e A307183 We see in this small example that the parenthesized terms reproduce the initial sequence:
%e A307183 (1),(0),(1),(1),(0),(1),(1),(1),(0),(1),...
%e A307183 The same is true for the subsequence of non-parenthesized terms:
%e A307183 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, ...
