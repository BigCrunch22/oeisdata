%N A307312 Underline all even terms; concatenations of underlined terms and of non-underlined terms both equal the concatenation of the entire sequence. This is the lexicographically earliest such sequence without duplicate terms and with an even digit among the first two terms.
%C A307312 This can be seen as a fractal sequence (from the digit's point of view).
%C A307312 If we don't require the sequence to have an even digit among the first two terms, there are infinitely many lexicographically earlier solutions with the first even digit appearing almost arbitrarily late, e.g., T = 1, 3, 21, 132, 13, 213, 1132, 2131, 13221, ..., or U = 1, 3, 5, 21, 13, 135, 1352, 1131351352, 13521, ... or V = 1, 3, 5, 7, 21,... or W = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 21, ... etc.
%C A307312 The lexicographically earliest sequence with no such constraint on a(2) would be A = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, ... (2k+1) ..., 1357911131517189, 1357911131517191, 1357911131517192, 12, 32, 52, 72, 931333537394, 14, 34, 54, 74, 951535557596, 16, 36, 56, ... So A(678,955,565,758,597) = 1,357,911,131,517,192 would be the earliest term different from 2n+1.
%C A307312 We see here how the three sets of A's digits are the same in their succession: the underlined digits, the non-underlined digits, and the digits of the sequence itself.

%e A307312 The sequence cannot start with 0 (which cannot be reproduced by the concatenation of odd terms), so it must start with 1. This cannot be followed by 0, 2, 4, ..., 8, 10, ..., 18, 20, so the smallest possible a(2) = 21. - _M. F. Hasler_, Apr 04 2019
%e A307312 The sequence starts with 1,21,12,112,121,11212,1112,12121,11,2121,...
%e A307312 Let's parenthesize the even terms:
%e A307312 1,21,(12),(112),121,(11212),(1112),12121,11,2121,...
%e A307312 We see that the parenthesized digits appear in the same order as the digits of the sequence.
%e A307312 Let's do the same with the odd terms:
%e A307312 (1),(21),12,112,(121),11212,1112,(12121),(11),(2121),...
%e A307312 We see again that the parenthesized digits appear in the same order as the digits of the sequence.
