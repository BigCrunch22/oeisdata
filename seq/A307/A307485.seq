%N A307485 A permutation of the nonnegative integers: one odd, two even, four odd, eight even, etc.; extended to nonnegative integer with a(0) = 0.
%C A307485 The simple idea of "list the first odd number, first two even numbers, next four odd numbers, next eight even numbers..." leads to a permutation of the positive integers, which can quite naturally be extended to a permutation of the nonnegative integers, with a(0) = 0.

%F A307485 Ignoring a(0) = 0, the k-th block (k >= 1) has 2^(k-1) terms, indexed from 2^(k-1) through 2^k-1, all having the same parity as k.
%F A307485 The difference between the last and the first term of this range is: a(2^k-1) - a(2^(k-1)) = 2^k - 2 = (2^(k-1) - 1)*2 = (starting index - 1) times two = ending index minus one.
%F A307485 The 1st, 3rd, ..., (2n+1)-th block = (n+1)-th odd block starts with A007583(n) = (1, 3, 11, 43, 171, ...), n >= 0.
%F A307485 The 2nd, 4th, ..., (2n+2)-th block = (n+1)-th even block starts with 2*A007583(n) = (2, 6, 22, 86, 342, ...), n >= 0, i.e., twice the starting value of the preceding odd block.
%F A307485 a(n) = 2*n - floor(2^k/3) where k = floor(log_2(4n+1)), n >= 0. (And 2^k == (-1)^k (mod 3) => floor(2^k/3) = (2^k-m)/3 with m = 1 if k even, m = 2 if k odd.)
%F A307485 Sum_{n>=1} (-1)^(n+1)/a(n) = Pi/4 - log(2)/2 (A196521). - _Amiram Eldar_, Nov 28 2023
