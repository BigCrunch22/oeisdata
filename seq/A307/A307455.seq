%N A307455 a(n) is the number of canonical polygons with n edges having exactly 1 line of reflection symmetry.
%C A307455 For n even, the symmetry line passes through two opposite vertices, or cuts through two opposite edges. For n odd it passes through one vertex and cuts the opposite edge. That explains the even-odd irregularity in the sequence.
