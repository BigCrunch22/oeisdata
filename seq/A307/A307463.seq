%N A307463 a(n) is the digit after the appearance of n in the decimal numbers of Pi after all the previous natural numbers of n have already appeared except for 0, and without overlap.
%C A307463 All terms appear in the decimal expansion of Pi.
%e A307463 See the first decimal digits of Pi for the examples:
%e A307463 3.(1)4159(2)65(3)589793238(4)62643383279(5)0288...
%e A307463 In parentheses the first appearing of natural numbers after all smaller natural numbers have already appeared.
%e A307463 - FIRST ELEMENT a(1):
%e A307463 For n=1, the first '1' appears in the first decimal place of Pi, and the next decimal digit is '4', so a(1)=4.
%e A307463 - DIGIT POSITION:
%e A307463 For n=4, although the first 4 appears in the 2 decimal place, not all the previous natural numbers of 4 have appeared, so, after 1, 2, and 3 have appeared (in this order), then, a(4) will be the next digit after the next 4. So a(4)=6.
%e A307463 - N WITH MORE THAN 1 DIGIT:
%e A307463 In the decimal digits of Pi: ...50284(10)270193852(11)05...
%e A307463 For n with more than 1 digit, a(n) is, after all the previous natural numbers have appeared, the next digit after all the digits of n have appeared consecutively. Example: a(10)=2, a(11)=0.
%e A307463 - NO OVERLAP:
%e A307463 In the decimal digits of Pi: ...52230825(33)44685035...730359825(34)904...
%e A307463 Example: for n=33, a(33)=4, but, as there is no overlap, the '3' cannot be used again with the '4' for n=34, so a(34) is defined by the next 34: a(34)=9.
