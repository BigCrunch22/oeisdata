%N A307498 Numbers k such that the digits of k in base 10 are a permutation of those of k in some other base.
%C A307498 Supersequence of A034294 and subsequence of A307498.
%C A307498 If the digits of k in base 10 is a permutation of m = (k in base b), 10^j < k < 10^(j+1), then 10^(j/(j+1)) < b < 10^((j+1)/j).
%C A307498 If k > 10, other base can only be 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, 28, 37, 46, 55, 64, 73, 82.
%C A307498 The digits of k in base 10 is a permutation of k in base 82 iff k = 91.
%C A307498 The largest term is less than 10^25. See proof in A034294.
%e A307498 13 in base 4 is 31, 227 in base 9 is 272.
%o A307498 (PARI) isok(k) = {my(v = vecsort(digits(k))); k < 10 || sum(j = 3, 82, vecsort(digits(k, j)) == v) > 1;}
