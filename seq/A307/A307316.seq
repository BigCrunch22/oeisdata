%N A307316 Number of leafless multigraphs with n edges.
%C A307316 Multigraphs with no loops and no degree-1 vertices. Computed with Nauty.
%C A307316 Conjecturally, the asymptotic number of completely symmetric polynomials of degree n up to momentum conservation in the limit as the number of particles increases.

%e A307316 For n=4 the multigraphs (as sets of edges) are {(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,0)}, {(0,1),(0,1),(1,2),(2,0)}, {(0,1),(0,1),(0,1),(0,1)}, {(0,1),(0,1),(1,2),(1,2)}, and {(0,1),(0,1),(2,3),(2,3)}.
%Y A307316 Conjecturally the same as A226919. Can be obtained from A307317 by combinatorics.
