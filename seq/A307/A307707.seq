%N A307707 Lexicographically earliest sequence starting with a(1) = 0 such that a(n) is the number of pairs of contiguous terms whose sum is a(n).
%C A307707 In order to avoid the trivial case "0 followed by 1's", the sum of every pair of consecutive terms must appear in the sequence. - _Rémy Sigrist_, Apr 24 2019
%C A307707 I think the present definition ("Lexicographically earliest sequence starting with a(1) = 0 such that a(n) is the number of pairs of contiguous terms whose sum is a(n)") should be changed to "Lexicographically earliest sequence of nonnegative numbers such that a(n) is the number of pairs of adjacent terms whose sum is n". Then there is no need for Sigrist's comment, and the definition becomes directly analogous to that of A121053. The terms will not change, although the Examples section will need rewriting. - _N. J.
