%N A307434 a(n) is the smallest k such that the p-rank of (Z/kZ)* is 2, where p = prime(n) and (Z/kZ)* is the multiplicative group of integers modulo n.
%C A307434 The p-rank of a finite abelian group G is equal to log_p(#{x belongs to G : x^p = 1}) where p is a prime number. By definition, a(n) is the smallest k such that x^p == 1 (mod k) has exactly p^2 solutions, p = prime(n).
%C A307434 a(n) exists for all n: by Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions, there exists a primes q congruent to 1 modulo p, in which case C_p X C_p is a subgroup of (Z/(q*p^2)Z)*, p = prime(n).
%C A307434 a(n) is the smallest k such that C_p X C_p is a subgroup of (Z/kZ)*, p = prime(n).
%C A307434 Also, a(n) is the smallest k such that there exists some x, y such that ord(x,k) = ord(y,k) = prime(n) and the set of powers of x and the set of powers of y modulo k have trivial intersection {1}, where ord(x,k) is the multiplicative order of x modulo k.
%C A307434 Let p, q be odd primes, then (Z/(q^e)Z)* has p-rank 1 if q == 1 (mod p), or q = p and e >= 2; 0 otherwise. As a result, for n >= 2, a(n) is of the form (q_1)*(q_2) or (q_1)*p^2 where q_1 and q_2 are the smallest two primes congruent to 1 modulo prime(n).
%C A307434 It seems that for n >= 4, a(n) is not divisible by prime(n)^2, that is, there exists at least two primes that are smaller than prime(n)^2 and congruent to 1 modulo prime(n).
