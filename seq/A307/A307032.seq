%N A307032 Permutation of the positive integers formed by moving each number the sum of its prime factors to the right.
%C A307032 To generate this sequence, start with a list of the positive integers. For each positive integer, calculate the sum of its prime factors (with multiplicity) and move each element that numbers of positions to the right in the sequence. This is a permutation of the positive integers. All prime numbers appear in increasing order.

%e A307032 Generation of the first five elements:
%e A307032 - Start with the natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
%e A307032 - Prime factorization of those numbers: 1, 2, 3, 2*2, 5.
%e A307032 - Sum of prime factors: 0, 2, 3, 4, 5.
%e A307032 - Now move each element:
%e A307032     - Move 1 0 steps: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
%e A307032     - Move 2 2 steps: 1, 3, 4, 2, 5.
%e A307032     - Move 3 3 steps: 1, 4, 2, 5, 3.
%e A307032     - Move 4 4 steps: 1, 2, 5, 3, 6, 4 (needed to extend range to move 4)
%e A307032     - Move 5 5 steps: 1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 7, 8, 5 (needed to extend range to move 5)
%e A307032     - Because 6, 7, 8 and 9 are also moved to the right, the first 5 elements are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
%Y A307032 Cf. A001414 (sum of primes dividing n, with repetition).
