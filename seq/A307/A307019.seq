%N A307019 Squares which can be expressed as the product of a number and its reversal in exactly three different ways.
%C A307019 1) Why do all these terms end with an even number of zeros?
%C A307019 1.1) Is it possible to find a term that does not end with zeros? If such a term m exists, this number must satisfy the Diophantine equation m^2 = a*rev(a) = b*rev(b) = c*rev(c). No solution (m,a,b,c) with m that does not end with zeros is known.
%C A307019 1.2) Consider now the Diophantine equation: m^2 = a*rev(a) = b*rev(b) where a is a palindrome and b is not a palindrome. For each solution (m,a,b), we generate terms (10*m)^2 of this sequence and we get: (10*m)^2 = 100 * m^2 = (100*a)*(rev(100*a) = (100*b)*(rev(100*b)) = (100*rev(b)) * (rev(100*rev(b))).
%C A307019 Example: with a(1) = 63504 = 252^2 = 252 * 252 = 144 * 441, so (m,a,b) = (63504,252,144), we obtain the 3 following ways: 6350400 = 25200 * 252 = 14400 * 441 = 44100 * 144.
%C A307019 2) When can square numbers be expressed in this way in more than three different ways?
%C A307019 If the Diophantine equation: m^2 = a*rev(a) = b*rev(b), with a <> b and a and b not palindromes has a solution, then it is possible to get integers equal to (10*m)^2 which can be expressed as the product of a number and its reversal in exactly four different ways.
%C A307019 We don't know if such a solution (m,a,b) exists.
%C A307019 _David A. Corneth_ has found 70 terms < 6*10^15 belonging to this sequence (see links in A083408), but no square has four solutions for m^2 = k * rev(k) until 6*10^15.
%C A307019 There is no square less than 10^24 with 4 or more different ways. - _Chai Wah Wu_, Apr 12 2019
