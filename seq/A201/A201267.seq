%N A201267 a(1) = 1 and a(n) is the least integer such that the continued fraction for 1/a(1) + 1/a(2) + ... + 1/a(n) contains exactly n elements.
%C A201267 Conjecture: limsup_{n->infinity} a(n) = infinity. More precisely we claim that log(a(n))/log(n) is bounded and does not converge to zero (see related link). Does a(n) = 2 infinitely many times or does it exist M >= 2 such that a(n) <= M infinitely many times?

%e A201267 1/a(1)+1/a(2)+1/a(3)+1/a(4)=1+1/2+1/3+1/11 = 127/66 and the continued fraction expansion is [1, 1, 12, 5] containing 4 elements. Next k=2 is the smallest integer >=1 such that the continued fraction expansion of 127/66+1/k which is [2, 2, 2, 1, 4] contains 5 elements, thus a(5) = 2.
