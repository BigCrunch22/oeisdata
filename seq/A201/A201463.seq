%N A201463 A list of 25 distinct numbers such that the sum of their reciprocals is 1 and each number is of the form p^i*q^j where p and q are distinct primes.
%C A201463 At the time Burshtein's paper appeared, this was the smallest example known of this type (it may still be the smallest).
%C A201463 Incidentally, this was the 200000th sequence added to the OEIS.
%C A201463 For the smallest example (20 numbers) of this type, see A237051. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Feb 02 2014
