%N A056735 Numbers k such that the base-3 expansions of 2^k and 2^(k+1) have the same number of 1's and the same number of digits.
%C A056735 Using empirical data for 1 <= k <= 10000, it has been found that the distribution of these terms correlates well (R^2 = 0.9798) with g(k) = b*sqrt(k) where b ~ 0.70. In addition, g'(k) approximates the probability that any particular k has this property. A056154 is a subsequence.
%e A056735 a(1)=5: 2^5 = 1012_3, 2^6 = 2101_2, both with two 1's and both of length 4.
