%N A056154 Numbers n such that the number of times each digit occurs in 2^n, represented in base 3, is the same as 2^(n+1), also represented in base 3. Or in other words, when represented in base 3, the digits in 2^n can be rearranged to form 2^(n+1).
%C A056154 For powers of 2 less than 2^1000, representations in base 3 are the only nontrivial examples where these kinds of pairs can be found. In other bases, for any integer n > 1, 2^(n+2) has the same frequency of digits as 2^(2n), represented in base (2^n)+1 (e.g., 2^3 and 2^4 in base 5, 2^4 and 2^6 in base 9, 2^5 and 2^8 in base 17, etc.).
%C A056154 For any n > 0, it can be shown that the distribution of these terms is approximately k*log(n), with k a small constant. This distribution can be derived from empirical evidence detailed in sequences A056734, A056735 and A056736.
