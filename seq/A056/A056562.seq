%N A056562 Number of primes which are the difference between two triangular numbers, where the smaller is the n-th triangular number.
%F A056562 a(n)=2 if both n+1 is prime and 2n+3 is prime, =1 if one of n+1 and 2n+3 is prime, =0 if neither are primes.
%e A056562 a(4)=2 because 4th triangular number is 10 and both 15-10=5 and 21-10=11 are primes.
