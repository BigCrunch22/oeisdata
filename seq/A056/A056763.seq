%N A056763 Number of integers in the range (2^(n-1), 2^n] for which d(k)^3 > k holds, i.e., the cube of the number of divisors of k exceeds the number k.
%C A056763 a(n) = 0 for n >= 36 since A056757 is finite and its last term is 27935107200 < 2^35. - _Amiram Eldar_, Jun 02 2024
%e A056763 a(5) = 11 because 11 integers, {18,20,21,22,24,25,26,27,28,30,32} occur between 1+2^4 = 17 and 2^5 = 32 for which the cube of number of divisors exceeds the number itself.
%e A056763 Between 2^28 and 2^29, 1730 such numbers occur, so a(29) = 1730.
