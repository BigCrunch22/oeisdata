%N A056613 Number of n-celled pseudo still lifes in Conway's Game of Life, up to rotation and reflection.
%C A056613 There are two slightly different possible definitions for a pseudo still life: a still life that can be partitioned into exactly two different still lifes, or a still life that can be partitioned into two *or more* still lifes. This sequence uses the latter definition. The first point in the sequence where this makes a difference is a(32) = 6123084116, which would be a(32) = 6123084115 under the former definition. - _Nathaniel Johnston_, May 25 2017
