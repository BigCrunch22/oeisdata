%N A095750 "Degree" of the Sophie Germain primes (A005384).
%C A095750 This sequence is derived from the special case of Cunningham chains of the first kind where every member of the chain is a Sophie Germain prime.
%C A095750 This sequence can be obtained by subtracting 2 from A074313 and then deleting all negative members. - _David Wasserman_, Sep 13 2007

%e A095750 Entries 0, 0, 1, 2, 3 correspond to the Sophie Germain primes 2, 3, 5, 11, 23. 5 is degree 1 because 5 = (2 * 2) + 1 and 2 is also a Sophie Germain prime. Similarly, 11 = (5 * 2) + 1, therefore 11 is degree 2. 23 = (11 * 2) + 1, thus 23 is degree 3 and so on.
%Y A095750 Cf. A005384.
