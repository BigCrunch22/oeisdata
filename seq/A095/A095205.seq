%N A095205 Least nonnegative integer not already in the sequence such that the frequency of digits in the entire sequence is as close to a uniform distribution as possible. A difference in frequency of at most 1 across all digits is allowed, and that difference must always be in favor of digits closer to 0.
%C A095205 Obviously no term contains identical digits and eventually for some m, a(m) = 1023456789 = a(n) for all n > m. Let d = number of numbers containing all distinct digits, using digits 0 to 9, then is it conjectured that: m is not equal to d, i.e., m < d. Question: what is m?

%e A095205 After 89 the next term is 102. It is not 11 or 12 as 0 has to occur first, it is not 20 as 1 has to occur earlier to 2.
