%N A095206 Let n = abcd...; a,b,c,d,... are digits of n. Define f(a) = bcd..., f(b) = acd..., f(c) = abd... and f(d) = abc..., i.e., f(i) = number obtained by deleting the digit i from n. Then a(n) = Sum f(i) mod i, where i ranges over all the nonzero digits of n.
%C A095206 a(k) = 0 for k < 11 and a(k) = 1 for 11 < k < 20.
%e A095206 a(23) = 3 mod 2 + 2 mod 3 = 1 + 2 = 3.
%e A095206 a(256) = 56 mod 2 + 26 mod 5 + 25 mod 6 =0 + 1 + 1 = 2.
