%e A095354 I.e. gives the number of primes whose Zeckendorf-expansion is n fibits long. a(1) = a(2) = 0, as there are no primes in ranges [1,2[ and [2,3[. a(3)=1 as in [3,5[ there is prime 3 with Fibonacci-representation 100. a(4)=2, as in [5,8[ there are primes 5 and 7. a(5)=1, as in [8,13[ there is only one prime 11 and a(6)=3 as in [13,21[ there are primes 13,17,19.
