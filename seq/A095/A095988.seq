%N A095988 Number of Gray codes for partitions of n.
%C A095988 List the partitions of n and form a graph where two partitions are connected if one can be transformed into the other by adding 1 from one element, subtracting 1 from another element and rearranging (if necessary). A Gray code corresponds to a Hamiltonian path through all of the partitions.
%C A095988 Terms a(6) through a(10) are given in the Knuth reference.
%D A095988 D. E. Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, vol. 4A, Combinatorial Algorithms, (to appear), section 7.2.1.4.
%e A095988 The partitions of the integer 6 are 111111, 21111, 3111, 2211, 222, 321, 33, 42, 411, 51, 6. Each term is obtained from the previous term by adding 1 to one element, subtracting 1 from another element and rearranging. This is the only way to do it for 6, so a(6)=1.
