%N A095905 Sequence generated from Golomb's proof of de Bruijn's theorem on a torus considered as a matrix.
%C A095905 Solomon W. Golomb's proof of de Bruijn's coloring theorem on a chessboard for 1 X 4 size pieces (that its impossible to color a 6 X 6 chessboard with pieces of size 1 X 4), is generalized for the torus by using M in a chessboard format. To quote Watkins, (p. 228): "However, Golomb was able to come up with a new coloring that, for example, shows that even on a torus you can't cover an m X n chessboard with 1 X 4 pieces unless 4 divides either m or n-that is, de Bruijn's theorem still holds, at least for 1 X 4 pieces." [p. 229]: And, "By the way, as de Bruijn himself originally proved, I should mention that de Bruijn's theorem holds in all higher dimensions; and so for example, an a X b X c solid block can be constructed out of 1 X 1 X k bricks only when k divides at least one of a,b, or c.".

%F A095905 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 21, a(n+2) = 15*a(n+1) + 18*a(n), n>2. Matrix method: Let M = the 6 X 6 matrix [1 2 1 2 1 2 / 3 4 3 4 3 4 / 1 2 1 2 1 2 / 3 4 3 4 3 4 / 1 2 1 2 1 2 / 3 4 3 4 3 4]. Then M^n *[1 0 0 0 0 0] = [a(n) q a(n) q a(n) q a(n) q], where q = a term in another sequence with the same recursion rule.
