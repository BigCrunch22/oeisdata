%N A095236 Given a row of n payphones (or phone booths), all initially unused, how many ways are there for n people to choose the payphones, assuming each always chooses one of the most distant payphones from those in use already?
%C A095236 More precisely: The first person chooses any payphone. Thereafter, each person chooses the middle of a largest span of unused phones, but a span of length L at the end of the row is taken to have length 2L-1 and its "middle" is the outermost phone. If a span has even length, either middle may be chosen.
%C A095236 Each person continues to use his payphone until all are in use.
%C A095236 The problem was originally stated in terms of urinals in a men's room.

%e A095236 From 6 payphones: A may pick any of the 6; he picks #4. B must pick #1. C must pick #6, since the others all are adjacent to A or B. D may pick #2 or #3; he picks #2. E may pick #3 or #5; he picks #5. F must pick #3. That gives the permutation (4,1,6,2,5,3), one of 36 possible permutations.
