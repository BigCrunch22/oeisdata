%N A095849 Numbers j where sigma_k(j) increases to a record for all real values of k.
%C A095849 For any value of k, sigma_k(j) > sigma_k(m) for all m < j, where the function sigma_k(j) is the sum of the k-th powers of all divisors of j.
%C A095849 Conjecture: a number is in this sequence if and only if it is in both A002182 and A095848. - _J. Lowell_, Jun 21 2008

%Y A095849 Cf. A002093 (highly abundant numbers), A002182 (highly composite numbers) and A004394 (superabundant numbers), consisting of numbers that establish records for sigma_k(j) where k equals 1, 0 and -1 respectively. See also A095848.
%Y A095849 Cf. also A166981 (numbers that establish records for both k=0 and k=-1).
