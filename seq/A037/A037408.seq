%N A037408 Positive numbers having the same set of digits in base 2 and base 3.
%C A037408 From _Alonso del Arte_, Sep 10 2017: (Start)
%C A037408 Neither binary repunits (A000225 without the initial 0) nor ternary repunits (A003462 without the initial 0) can be in this sequence, except for 1.
%C A037408 The ternary repunits are numbers of the form (3^k - 1)/2. If k is odd, then (3^k - 1)/2 is even and therefore its binary representation ends in 0. If k is even, then (3^k - 1)/2 = 1 mod 4, which means its binary representation ends in 01.
%C A037408 For much more obvious reasons, numbers with even just one 2 in their ternary representations (A074940) can't be in this sequence. (End)

%e A037408 9 is 1001 in binary and 100 in ternary. In both representations, the set of digits used is {0, 1}, hence 9 is in the sequence.
%e A037408 10 is 1010 in binary and 101 in ternary. In both representations, the set of digits used is {0, 1}, hence 10 is in the sequence.
%e A037408 11 is 1011 in binary and 102 in ternary. Clearly the binary representation can't include the digit 2, hence 11 is not in the sequence.
