%N A054500 Indicator sequence for classification of nonattacking queens on n X n toroidal board.
%C A054500 The three sequences A054500/A054501/A054502 are used to classify solutions to the problem of "Nonattacking queens on a 2n+1 X 2n+1 toroidal board" by their symmetry; solutions are considered equivalent iff they differ only by rotation, reflection or torus shift.
%C A054500 For brevity, let i(n) = A054500(n) (indicator sequence), m(n) = A054501(n) (multiplicity) and c(n) = A054502(n) (count).
%C A054500 i(n) = k means that there are solutions for the k X k board and that m(n) and c(n) refer to it. There are c(n) inequivalent solutions which may be extended to m(n) different representations each (i.e., m(n) permutations).
%C A054500 This gives two formulas: A007705(n) = Sum (c(k) * m(k)), A053994(n) = Sum (c(k)), where the sum is taken over all k for which i(k) = 2n+1, for both formulas. Note that m(n) is always a divisor of 8 * i(n)^2.

%e A054500 For a 19 X 19 toroidal board, you have three entries in the indicator sequence A054500; their count terms (A054502) give 354 = 4 + 132 + 218 inequivalent solutions; together with their multiplicity (A054501) they add up to 4*76 + 132*1444 + 218*2888 = 820496 solutions at all.
