%N A054701 Smallest prime followed by three gaps that are multiples of 2n.
%C A054701 Equivalently, smallest prime such that the next three primes are at distances divisible by 2n. The gaps are generally not the same, so these are not starting points of four consecutive primes in arithmetic progression (CPAP-4) as listed in A054800. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 06 2018
%H A054701 <a href="/index/Pri#gaps">OEIS index entries related to gaps between primes</a>.
%e A054701 a(1) = 3 is the smallest prime such that the next three gaps (2, 2 and 4; involving primes 5, 7 and 11) are multiples of 2*1 = 2.
%e A054701 a(1) = 199 is the smallest prime such that the next three gaps (12, 12 and 4; to primes 211, 223, and 227) are multiples of 2*2 = 4.
%Y A054701 Cf. A001223 (prime gaps).
