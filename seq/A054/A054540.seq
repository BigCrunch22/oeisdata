%N A054540 A list of equal temperaments (equal divisions of the octave) whose nearest scale steps are closer and closer approximations to the six simple ratios of musical harmony: 6/5, 5/4, 4/3, 3/2, 8/5 and 5/3.
%C A054540 The sequence was found by a computer search of all of the equal divisions of the octave from 1 to over 3985011. There seems to be a hidden aspect or mystery here: what is it about the more and more harmonious equal temperaments that causes them to express themselves collectively as a perfect, self-accumulating recurrent sequence?

%C A054540 The answer is because temperament mappings can be added. If harmonic correspondences are written in a bra, that is <N2 N3 N5], where Nx is the step corresponding to the x-th harmonic, then these types of one-row matrices can be added and the resulting temperament will represent them as well. In case of temperaments with high precision, this also leads to another high-precision temperament. Such a bra notation is referred to as "val" by the microtonal music community, and in simple words, vals can be added together to produce another val.
%C A054540 Example: a tuning with 118 equal steps to the octave has a second harmonic on the 118th step by definition, the third harmonic is approximated with 187 steps, and the fifth is with 274 steps, which leads to <118 187 274]. A 171 equal division system will have a corresponding bra <171 271 397]. When these two are added, we obtain <289 458 671], which is exactly how the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th harmonics are represented in 289 equal divisions of the octave. (End)

%e A054540 34 = 31 + the earlier term 3. Again, 118 = 53 + the earlier terms 34 and 31.
