%N A304938 a(n) is the smallest number which can be written in n different ways as an ordered product of prime factors.
%C A304938 It can be easily demonstrated that a(n) exists for all n and is less than or equal to 2^(n-1)*3 since 2^(n-1)*3 can be written in n different ways.
%C A304938 If n is a prime number then a(n) = 2^(n-1)*3, but there are also nonprime numbers n with this property (e.g., 9 and 14).
%C A304938 If n=k! then a(n) is the product of the first k prime numbers.
%C A304938 Finding the terms up to 2^64 was the focus of the 4th question of the ICPC coding challenge in 2013.

%F A304938 a(p) = 2^(p-1)*3 if p is a prime.
%F A304938 a(k!) = prime(k)# is the k-th primorial number. So for no m < k!, prime(k) | a(m). - _David A. Corneth_, May 24 2018
%F A304938 a(n) = min { k : A008480(k) = n }. - _Alois P. Heinz_, May 26 2018
%e A304938 a(1) = 1 because only a prime power or the empty product (which equals 1) can be written in just one way, and no prime power is smaller than 1.
%e A304938 a(2) = 6 = 3 * 2 = 2 * 3 because none of 3, 4, 5 can be written in two different ways.
%e A304938 a(3) = 12 = 3 * 2 * 2 = 2 * 3 * 2 = 2 * 2 * 3 (each of 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 can be written in at most 2 ways).
%e A304938 a(4) = 24 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 (each of 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 can be written in at most 3 ways).
