%N A304281 Numbers equal to the sum of their aliquot parts, each of them decreased by 2.
%C A304281 Searched up to n = 10^12.
%C A304281 From _Giovanni Resta_, May 11 2018: (Start)
%C A304281 If p = 2^(1+t) + (1+2*t)*k - 1 is a prime, for some t > 0 and k even, then x = 2^t*p is in the sequence where k is the value by which the sum of aliquot parts is increased.
%C A304281 In this sequence k = -2; for t = 21 we get 8795910569984, which is a term greater than 8292352, but this does not exclude the existence of other intermediate terms following a different solution pattern. (End)
%C A304281 Terms using odd values of k seem very hard to find. Up to n = 10^12, only three such terms are known: 2, 98, and 8450, for k = 1, 5, and -7, respectively.
%e A304281 Aliquot parts of 208 are 1 and 1, 2, 4, 8, 13, 16, 26, 52, 104 and (1-2) + (2-2) + (4-2) + (8-2) + (13-2) + (16-2) + (26-2) + (52-2) + (104-2) = 208.
