%N A304652 Digits of the Copeland-Erdős constant taken in groups of five digits.
%C A304652 This sequence is presented by the Foo Bar Challenge, a recruitment tool for Google, as the challenge to renumber some entities with 5-digit ID numbers taken from the first 10004 places of the Copeland-Erdős constant.
%C A304652 The ID numbers are to be left zero-padded as needed to ensure they all consist of five digits. Of course here in the OEIS leading zeros will just be dropped.
%C A304652 The Foo Bar Challenge statement of the problem says nothing of the fact that there are duplicates among these well before 10000.
