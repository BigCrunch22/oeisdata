%N A304238 a(n) is the smallest positive integer not yet in the sequence that is obtained when the first and last digits of a(n-1) are exchanged and used in a(n) in the exchanged order (and necessarily adjacent); a(1)=10.
%C A304238 Unlike A304237, there are no consecutive numbers in the sequence up to n=82.
%C A304238 Could have started sequence with offset a(0)=0 and it would be the same sequence.
%e A304238 a(8)=112 since 112 is the smallest positive number not yet in the sequence that is obtained when the first and last digits of a(7)=21 are exchanged and used adjacent in that order (without the adjacency condition, we would have a(8)=102 as in A304237).
