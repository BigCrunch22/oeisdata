%N A304245 Numbers that yield a prime when '2' is inserted between the first and second digit, or prime(k+1) is inserted after the k-th digit for any k > 1, k < number of digits.
%C A304245 The primes to be inserted are: 2 between 1st and 2nd digit, or 5 between 2nd and 3rd digit, or 7 between 3rd and 4th digit, etc.
%C A304245 The prime 3 is excluded because it would restrict the terms to have no more than 4 digits; see A304244 and the Rivera link in A304243.
%C A304245 The two terms 27 and 87 are the only numbers (with more than one digit) for which 2, 5 or 7 can be inserted between any two digits to yield a prime: all of 227, 257, 277, 827, 857 an 877 are prime. There is no other such number with more than 2 digits.

%e A304245 The 1-digit numbers 0..9 are included since the condition is voidly satisfied: nothing can be inserted, therefore each of the resulting numbers is prime.
%e A304245 17 is in the sequence because 127 is prime.
%e A304245 101 is in the sequence because 1201 and 1051 are prime.
