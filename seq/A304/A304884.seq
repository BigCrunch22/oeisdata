%N A304884 Size of the largest subset of the cyclic group of order n which does not contain a nontrivial 3-term arithmetic progression.
%C A304884 Each term is at most the corresponding term of A003002.
%C A304884 Arithmetic progressions are trivial if they are of the form x,x,x.

%e A304884 For n=10, the integers (mod 10) have sets with four elements like {1,2,4,5} which contain no arithmetic progressions with 3 elements, but no such sets with five elements.  For example, {1,2,4,5,8} has the progression 2,8,4, and {1,2,4,5,9} has the progression 4,9,4.  Since four is the most elements possible, a(10) = 4. - _Michael B. Porter_, May 26 2018
