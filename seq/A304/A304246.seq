%N A304246 Numbers that yield a prime whenever a '1' is inserted between any two digits.
%C A304246 The single-digit terms voidly satisfy the condition: no '1' can be inserted anywhere, so all possible insertions yield a prime.
%C A304246 Motivated by sequence A164329 which is the analog for inserting 0.
%C A304246 Compare to A068673 where 1 is prefixed or appended, and to A068679 where 1 is prefixed, appended or inserted anywhere - which is therefore the intersection between this sequence and A068673.
%C A304246 See also A050711 where 1 is inserted between all adjacent digits. - _R. J. Mathar_, Feb 28 2020
%e A304246 21 is in the sequence, because if '1' is inserted between "any" pair consecutive digits (the only possibility being to insert it between the first and second digit, which yields 211), the result is always prime. The definition does not require the term itself to be prime.
%e A304246 103 is in the sequence because inserting 1 between the first and second, or between the second and third digit, would yield 1103 or 1013, respectively, which are both prime.
