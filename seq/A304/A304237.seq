%N A304237 a(n) is the smallest positive integer not yet in the sequence that is obtained when the first and last digits of a(n-1) are exchanged and used in a(n) in the exchanged order (but not necessarily adjacent); a(1)=10.
%C A304237 Up to n=82, the only consecutive numbers in the sequence are 111, 112 and 222, 223.
%C A304237 Could have started sequence with offset a(0)=0 and it would be the same sequence.
%e A304237 a(2)=101 since 101 is the smallest positive number not yet in the sequence that is obtained when the first and last digits of a(1)=10 are exchanged and used in that order.
%e A304237 a(8)=102 since 102 is the smallest positive number not yet in the sequence that is obtained when the first and last digits of a(7)=21 are exchanged and used in that order (but not necessarily adjacent).
