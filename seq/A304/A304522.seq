%N A304522 Number of ordered ways to write n as the sum of a Fibonacci number and a positive odd squarefree number.
%C A304522 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 0, and a(n) = 1 only for n = 1, 2, 27, 83, 31509.
%C A304522 This conjecture implies that any integer n > 1 not equal to 83 can be written as the sum of a positive Fibonacci number and a positive odd squarefree number, which has been verified for n up to 10^10. Note that 83 = 0 + 83 = 1 + 2*41, where 0 and 1 are Fibonacci numbers, and 83 and 2*41 are squarefree.
%C A304522 The author would like to offer 1000 US dollars as the prize for the first complete solution to his conjecture that any positive integer is the sum of a Fibonacci number and a positive odd squarefree number.

%e A304522 a(1) = 1 since 1 = 0 + 1 with 0 a Fibonacci number and 1 odd and squarefree.
%e A304522 a(2) = 1 since 2 = 1 + 1 with 1 = A000045(1) = A000045(2) a Fibonacci number and 1 odd and squarefree.
%e A304522 a(27) = 1 since 27 = 8 + 19 with 8 = A000045(6) a Fibonacci number and 19 odd and squarefree.
%e A304522 a(83) = 1 since 83 = 0 + 83 with 0 = A000045(0) a Fibonacci number and 83 odd and squarefree.
%e A304522 a(31509) = 1 since 31509 = 10946 + 20563 with 10946 = A000045(21) a Fibonacci number and 20563 odd and squarefree.
