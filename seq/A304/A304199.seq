%N A304199 Number of fully-leafed free tree-like 4d-polycubes of size n.
%C A304199 A free tree-like polycube of size n in four dimensions is a hyperface-connected set of n cells in the 4d-hypercubic lattice, up to translation, rotation and reflection, whose dual graph has no cycles. It is said to be fully-leafed when it has the maximal number of leaves over all the same sized free tree-like 4d-polycubes.
