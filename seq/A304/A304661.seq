%N A304661 Numbers n that are log_2(n-1)-smooth, i.e., such that all the prime factors of n are less than log_2(n).
%C A304661 The sequence is a monoid since it contains 1 and is closed under multiplication, since if m and n are terms, then any prime dividing m or n must be less than log base 2 of m*n. Density: 27% of the numbers from 1 to 64 are terms. From 2^120 +1 to 2^120+64, 0% are terms. However, it is an infinite sequence, since 2^n is always a term, for n>2.
%C A304661 These numbers are analogous to numbers that are "sqrt(n-1)-smooth" (see A063539).

%e A304661 40 = 2^3*5 is a term because 2 and 5 are both less than log_2(40).
%e A304661 63 = 9*7 is not a term since 7 is greater than log_2(63).
%e A304661 1 is vacuously a term since it has no prime factors.
