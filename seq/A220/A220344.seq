%N A220344 The number of reversible primes (palindromic or emirps) by increasing permissible leading digit and by length.
%C A220344 Aside from the first 4 terms here (corresponding to 2, 3, 5 and 7), the counts of 4 successive terms are of primes with leading digit 1, 3, 7 and 9 that are still prime if their decimal representations are reversed.  A220248 and A220349 handle palindromic primes and emirps separately.
%e A220344 a(5) is the start of the counts for 2-digit primes. 11, 13 and 17 are the only 2-digit primes with leading digit 1 that remain prime read backward.  It is not possible for a prime of more than 1 digit to lead with 2 and yield a prime read in reverse, so the following term, a(6), is the count for leading digit 3.
%Y A220344 Cf. A220248, A220349.
