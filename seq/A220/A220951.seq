%N A220951 Primes p such that p+6 is also prime and there is a power of two in the interval (p,p+6).
%C A220951 A search for sexy primes bracketing a power of two was conducted up to 2^1500. It is conjectured that this is a finite sequence.
%C A220951 On the basis of existing work about primes of the form 2^n+k and 2^n-k, plus a few additional tests, we have a(9) > 2^750740. - _Giovanni Resta_, Feb 21 2013
