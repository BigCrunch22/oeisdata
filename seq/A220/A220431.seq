%N A220431 Number of ways to write n=x+y (x>0, y>0) with 3x-1, 3x+1 and xy-1 all prime.
%C A220431 Conjecture: a(n)>0 for all n>3.
%C A220431 This has been verified for n up to 10^8, and it is stronger than A. Murthy's conjecture related to A109909.
%C A220431 Conjecture verified for n up to 10^9. - _Mauro Fiorentini_, Jul 26 2023
%C A220431 The conjecture implies the twin prime conjecture for the following reason: If x_1<...<x_k are positive integers and q_1,...,q_k are distinct primes greater than x_k, then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem there are infinitely many positive integers n such that x_i(n-x_i) == 1 (mod q_i).
%C A220431 Zhi-Wei Sun also made some similar conjectures. For example, any integer n>2 not equal to 63 can be written as x+y (x>0, y>0) with 2x-1, 2x+1 and 2xy+1 all prime.
