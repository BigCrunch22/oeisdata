%N A220478 Equilateral triangle from the snowflake (or E-toothpick) structure of A161330 (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A220478 It appears that if n >> 1 the structure looks like an equilateral triangle, which is essentially one of the six wedges of the E-toothpick (or snowflake) structure of A161330. The sequence gives the number of E-toothpicks in the structure after n stages. A220498 (the first differences) gives the number added at the n-th round. For more information and some illustrations see A161330. For the E-toothpick right triangle see A211964.
