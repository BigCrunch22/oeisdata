%N A220249 Numbers of rows R of the Wythoff array such that R is the n-th multiple of a tail of the Lucas sequence.
%C A220249 This sequence is corresponding to A173027. Also Row 2 of the array A173028.
%C A220249 It appears that the numbers of this sequence form groups of m members respectively with same distance d of two consecutive values a(n) such that d is equal to odd-indexed Lucas numbers (A002878) while m is equal to odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers (A001519). Example: from n=988 to 2584 d=3571 and m=1597;
%C A220249 Also of interest are the gaps between two consecutive groups which appear to be sums of one Lucas number L(2n+1) plus one Fibonacci number F(4n). Example: gap 5 after a(55) is 6964 = L(11) + F(20) = 199 + 6765
%C A220249 Likewise, the tail (as mentioned in this sequence's name) of the Lucas sequence is chopped off by two initial terms at each of the gap positions.
