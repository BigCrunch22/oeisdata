%N A220499 Number of line segments in an H tree with n levels that have no correspondence with the toothpicks of the toothpick structure of A139250 after n-th stage.
%C A220499 More generally, differences between A000225 and A139250.

%F A220499 a(n) = A000225(n) - A139250(n).
%e A220499 For n = 0..3, the number of line segments in the H tree equals the number of toothpicks in the toothpick structure of A139250, so a(n) = 0, if 0 <= n <= 3. Note that there is a correspondence between every element from the two structures. For n = 4 the H tree contains 15 line segments, on the other hand the toothpick structure contains only 11 toothpicks. There are four line segments in the H tree that have no correspondence with the toothpicks of the toothpicks structure. They are the four line segments of the last generation that are closer to the center of the H tree, so a(4) = 4.
