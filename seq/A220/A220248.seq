%N A220248 The number of palindromic primes leading and ending with 1, 3, 7 or 9 -- in sequence -- of length 2*ceiling(n/4)+1.
%C A220248 The way the sequence is titled/written is to give uniformity to the numbers considered.  Thus, a(4k-3), a(4k-2), a(4k-1) and a(4k) are the counts of the (2k+1)-digit palprimes beginning with 1, 3, 7 and 9, respectively, leaving out consideration of the primes 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11 (the first 5 terms of A002385) as not really of type as far as this sequence is concerned.
%e A220248 If one wants, say, the number of 13-digit palindromic primes with 7 as the leading digit, then what one wants is the 3rd term after 5 groups of 4, or the 23rd, which is a(23)=87149.  The palprimes corresponding to a(1)=5 are 101, 131, 151, 181 and 191.
%Y A220248 Cf. A002385, A220344, A220349.
