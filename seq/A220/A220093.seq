%N A220093 a(n) is the smallest odd positive integer > 1 that makes the composite number 2*n-a(n)*p1 divisible by p2, where p1 and p2 are the smallest and 2nd smallest odd prime numbers that are not factors of n. When no such odd positive integer exists, a(n)=0.
%C A220093 Most positive integers are averages of pairs of coprime composite numbers (c1, c2), as of A141097.
%C A220093 For any 2*n=c1+c2, 2*n, c1, and c2 are coprime to each other.
%C A220093 Suppose c1=a*p1, c2=b*p2, where p1 and p2 are the smallest and second smallest prime numbers that are not factors of n; this sequence lists the smallest possible a value for any positive integer n.
%C A220093 The first Mathematica program checks through all number pairs to obtain this sequence.  The second analytically calculates it.  The results of the two programs are consistent up to n=100000.

%e A220093 When n <= 16, 2*n cannot be written as the sum of a pair of coprime composites, so a(n)=0 for n=1..16.
%e A220093 When n=17, 3 and 5 are the smallest primes that are not factors of 17, 2*n=34=3*3+5*5, 9 and 25 are coprime composites, so a(17)=9/3=3.
%e A220093 ...
%e A220093 When n=31, 3 and 5 are the smallest primes that are not factors of 31, 2*n=62=3*9+5*7, 27 and 35 are coprime composites, so a(31)=27/3=9.
