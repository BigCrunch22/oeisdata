%N A220164 Number of simple squared squares of order n up to symmetry.
%C A220164 A squared rectangle is a rectangle dissected into a finite number, two or more, of squares, called the elements of the dissection. If no two of these squares have the same size the squared rectangle is called perfect, otherwise it is imperfect. The order of a squared rectangle is the number of constituent squares. The case in which the squared rectangle is itself a square is called a squared square. The dissection is simple if it contains no smaller squared rectangle, otherwise it is compound. This sequence counts both perfect and imperfect simple squared squares up to symmetry.
