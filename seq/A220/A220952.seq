%N A220952 A twisted enumeration of the nonnegative integers.
%C A220952 Initially _Don Knuth_ gave as the definition of this sequence "A sequence that I'm submitting as a problem for publication (see note in comments!)" and the comment that "As soon as a solution is published, I'll provide lots more info; the sequence is so fascinating, it has caused me to take three days off from writing The Art of Computer Programming, but I plan to use it in Chapter 8 some day."
%C A220952 In order for the definition to make sense, it looks like any integer has to be preceded by infinitely many zeros in its base-5 representation. This ensures that the condition is not vacuous for single-digit numbers, so that (except for 0) they also have two adjacent numbers. - _Jean-Paul Allouche_, Aug 25 2017
%C A220952 [Obviously it is understood that a_i = 0 for all i > log_5(a)+1. But it is sufficient to take all i < log_5(max(a,b))+2, i.e., to consider just one "leading zero" for the larger number, and as many digits for the smaller number. - _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 13 2018]

%C A220952 The sequence is defined by Knuth as follows.
%C A220952 Say that nonnegative integers a and b are adjacent when their base-5 expansions ...a_2 a_1 a_0 and ...b_2 b_1 b_0 satisfy the condition that if i > j then the pairs of base-5 digits (a_i,a_j) and (b_i,b_j) are either equal or consecutive in the path through {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}^2 shown at the diagram:

%C A220952 Actually, every positive integer is adjacent to exactly two nonnegative integers, and we can write down a permutation of nonnegative integers starting with 0 such that the two consecutive numbers in it are adjacent. That permutation is this sequence.

%C A220952 The first differences appear to be +- 5^k, for some k >= 0.
%C A220952 Fractal behavior: when n = 5^k - 1, k >= 2, a similar image is completed.
%C A220952 (End)
%C A220952 The first differences are +- 5^k, this is a Gray code in base 5. - _Joerg Arndt_, Feb 05 2022
