%N A220512 D-toothpick sequence of the third kind starting with a cross formed by 4 toothpicks.
%C A220512 This is a toothpick sequence of forking paths to 135 degrees. The sequence gives the number of toothpicks and D-toothpicks in the structure after n-th stage. A221565 (the first differences) give the number of toothpicks or D-toothpicks added at n-th stage. It appears that the structure has a fractal (or fractal-like) behavior. For more information see A194700.
%C A220512 First differs from A194432 at a(14).
