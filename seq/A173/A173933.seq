%N A173933 The number of numbers m < k/2 such that m/k is a reduced fraction in the Cantor set, where k= A173931(n).
%C A173933 When k is a prime of the form (3^r-1)/2, then the m are 2^r-1 numbers (greater than 0) whose base-3 representation consists of only 0's and 1's. Hence, for r=3,7, and 13, the primes k are 13, 1093, and 797161, and the number of m < k/2 is 3, 63, and 4095.

%e A173933 When k=40, then 1/k, 3/k, 9/k, and 13/k have base-3 representations containing only the digits 0 and 2.
