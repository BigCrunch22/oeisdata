%N A173101 Self-describing semiprimes.
%C A173101 This is to A001358 as A108810 is to A000040.

%F A173101 {A109776 INTERSECTION A001358}. a(n) = n-th integer k such that OMEGA(k)=2 where OMEGA(n) is the sum of the exponents in the prime decomposition of k, and reading the number (in base 10) in successive pairs of digits gives a (possibly redundant) description of the number.
%e A173101 a(1) = 22 because "22" does indeed consist of "two 2's" and 22 = 2 * 11 is semiprime. a(4) = 10213223 because 10213223 consists of one "0", two 1's, three 2's, and two 3's; and 10213223 = 41 * 249103 is semiprime.
