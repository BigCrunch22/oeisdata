%N A173341 Numbers n such that n^5 and a cube are between consecutive squares.
%C A173341 This sequence appears to be infinite. Sequence A117594 is a subsequence. The corresponding sequence for n^7 is A173342. Are there ever more than two perfect powers between consecutive squares?
%e A173341 2 is here because 2^5=32 and 3^3=27 are between 5^2=25 and 6^2=36.
%e A173341 23 is here because 23^5 and 186^3 are between 2536^2 and 2537^2.
%e A173341 199 is here because 199^5 and 6783^3 are between 558640^2 and 558641^2.
