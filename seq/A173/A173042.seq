%N A173042 Numbers n that cannot be decomposed into the sum of up to 4 squares using the following algorithm: If n is not decomposable using the algorithm: [Repeat the following 2 steps 4 times: 1-find the largest square s smaller than n; 2-n=n-s Numbers that can be decomposed yield final values of n=0.] then choose the first square as the second largest square smaller than n and try finding the remaining up to 3 squares using the 2 steps of the algorithm in brackets.
%C A173042 This is a subsequence of A112687.

%e A173042 For n=48: it is not decomposable using the algorithm in brackets, so instead of using the first s=36 we choose s=25 (the second largest). So the attempt to decompose 48 is now 5*5+(up to more 3 squares which will be found using steps 1 and 2 of the algorithm in brackets). This yields 5*5+4*4+2*2+1*1 which does not give 48 hence it is not decomposable using this algorithm.
