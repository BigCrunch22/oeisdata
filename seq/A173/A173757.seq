%N A173757 Numbers k such that exactly one of k^2 + k + 1 and k^2 + k + 11 is prime.
%C A173757 Numbers k such that either k^2+k+1 or k^2+k+11 is prime, but not both. - _R. J. Mathar_, Mar 01 2010
%e A173757 0 is in the sequence because 0^2+0+1 = 1 is nonprime and 0^2+0+11 = 11 is prime; 1 is not in the sequence because 1^2+1+1 = 3 is prime and 1^2+1+11 = 13 is also prime, 10 is not in the sequence because 10^2+10+1 = 111 is nonprime and 10^2+10+11 = 121 is also nonprime; 14 is in the sequence because 14^2+14+1 = 211 is prime and 14^2+14+11 = 221 is nonprime.
