%N A173189 For bases beginning with b=2, a(b) is the number of primes beginning with a power of b that are a concatenation of simply decremented numbers that are less than A227775(b).
%C A173189 This sequence is motivated by the number of small primes in base ten that are a concatenation of a power of ten followed by decremented numbers. The terms after the first two are generated by the below program, which relies upon the infrequent failure of PARI's 'ispseudoprime' function to eliminate composites, and is thus subject to (unlikely) revision.
%C A173189 A227775 was composed later as an afterthought to simplify the title here (at least). The term for b=79 is remarked on there (as likely too large for computation), and, on the basis of the situation of computability with that value, it's very likely a first term larger than 17 is not computable in any reasonable time and with certainty; so a question is whether any base can be found for that to occur.
%e A173189 For n=10, the smallest prime starting with a power of ten and ascending by concatenation of incremented numbers starts with 10^13 and runs to a concatenation of ten numbers. The descending numbers less than this derive from the first ten elements of A096594, the first four values of 10^4k+10^3k-10^k-3, the prime running from 1000 to 993, and the primes that stem from 100 and run to 91 and to 61.
