%N A173563 Number of positive integers not the sum of distinct positive n-th powers.
%C A173563 Fuller and Nichols prove that a(6) = 2037573096. - _Robert Nichols_, Sep 10 2017
%C A173563 Here, the "sum of n-th powers" includes the case where this sum consists in just one term. (For example, 1 is the sum of just 1^n, for any n; and 4 = 2^2 is considered to be a sum of distinct squares.) - _M. F. Hasler_, May 25 2020
