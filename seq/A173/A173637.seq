%N A173637 Conway notation for rational 2-component links.
%C A173637 The ordering of the list is based on increasing crossing numbers and inverse lexicographical order for the terms with the same crossing number.
%C A173637 This is to links what A122495 is to knots.
%C A173637 All these links are chiral.
%C A173637 Each term is actually an ordered set of positive integers, concatenated; as long as all integers are 1-digit, it's not a problem, but a(30) requires "digit" 10, so at that point the sequence becomes not fully well-defined. An irregular array of these numbers would be well-defined.
%C A173637 Number of the terms of this sequence with crossing number k plus number of the terms of A122495 with crossing number k equals A005418(k-2). - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, May 23 2017

%e A173637 a(1) = 2 because 2 is the Conway notation for the Hopf link.
%e A173637 a(2) = 4 because 4 is the Conway notation for the (2,4) torus link.
