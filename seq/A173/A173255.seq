%N A173255 Smaller member p of a twin prime pair (p, p+2) such that the sum p+(p+2) is a fifth power: 2*(p+1) = k^5 for some integer k.
%C A173255 Since k^5 = 2*(p+1) is even, k is also even.
%C A173255 The lesser of twin primes p (except for 3) are congruent to -1 modulo 3 (see third comment in A001359), the greater of twin primes p+2 (except for 5) are congruent to 1 modulo 3. Therefore p+1 is a multiple of 3. Since k^5 = 2*(p+1) is a multiple of 3, k is also a multiple of 3. Hence k is divisible by 2 and by 3, i.e. a multiple of 6.
%C A173255 The lesser of twin primes except for 3 (A001359) are congruent to 1, 7 or 9 modulo 10; this applies also to the terms of the present sequence, a subsequence of A001359.

%e A173255 p = 4076863487 and p+2 form a twin prime pair, their sum 8153726976 = 96^5 is a fifth power. Hence 4076863487 is in the sequence.
%e A173255 p = 641194278911 and p+2 form a twin prime pair, their sum 1282388557824 = 264^5 is a fifth power. Hence 641194278911 is in the sequence.
%e A173255 p = 388931440807883087 and p+2 form a twin prime pair, their sum 777862881615766176 = 3786^5 is a fifth power. Hence 388931440807883087 is in the sequence.
%e A173255 3786 is the smallest value of k that gives a prime when divided by 6, it corresponds to a(6): 3786 = 6*631 and 631 is prime. The next value of k that gives a prime when divided by 6 is 10326 and corresponds to a(11): 10326 = 6*1721 and 1721 is prime.
%e A173255 If p is a term and k^5 the corresponding fifth power, then a fifth-power multiple c^5*k^5 does not necessarily correspond to a term q. The fifth power 96^5 corresponds to a(1), but q = 2^5*96^5/2-1 = 130459631615 = 5*7607*3429989 is not prime, much less is (q, q+2) a twin prime pair.
%e A173255 If p is a term and k^5 the corresponding fifth power, and if k^5 is the product c^5*d^5 of two fifth powers where d is even, then d^5 does not necessarily correspond to a term q. The fifth power 3786^5 = 3^5*1262^5 corresponds to a(6), but q = 1262^5/2-1 = 1600540908674415 = 3*5*577*55171*3351883 is not prime, much less is (q, q+2) a twin prime pair.
