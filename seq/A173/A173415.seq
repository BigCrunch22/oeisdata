%e A173415 a(1)=1 because (1st prime+1)^2 - (1st prime)^2=5 is prime and (1st prime+1)^2 + (1st prime)^2=13 is prime;
%e A173415 a(2)=3 because (3rd prime+1)^2 - (3rd prime)^2=11 is prime and (3rd prime+1)^2 + (3rd prime)^2=61 is prime;
%e A173415 a(3)=10 because (10th prime+1)^2 - (10th prime)^2=59 is prime and (10th prime+1)^2 + (10th prime)^2=1741 is prime;
%e A173415 a(4)=128 because (128th prime+1)^2 - (128th prime)^2=1439 is prime and (128th prime+1)^2 + (128th prime)^2=1035361 is prime.
