%N A173450 Decimal expansion of (69^2)*10^6 + 69^3.
%C A173450 There is (probably) no simpler arithmetic expression whose value consists of 10 distinct digits.
%C A173450 In the absence of some clarification as to how the "simplicity" of an arithmetic expression is to be measured, it could be argued that other expressions yielding pandigital numbers (e.g., (10^11 - 910)/81, which gives 1234567890) are at least as simple as the one that defines this sequence. - _Jon E.
