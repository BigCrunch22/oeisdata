%N A173028 Partition of the row numbers of the Wythoff array W: two numbers are in the same row if and only if their rows in W have (essentially) a common divisor greater than 1.
%C A173028 (Row 1) = A173027, (Row 2) = A220249. Every positive integer occurs exactly once, so that, as a sequence, this is a permutation of the natural numbers.
%F A173028 Let R(n,k) be the number in row n, column k. After Row 1 (A173027),
%F A173028 inductively, R(n,1) is the least positive integer not in the first n-1
%F A173028 rows, and the rest of row n consists of the numbers of rows X of the
%F A173028 Wythoff array W for X a multiple of a tail of row R(n,1) of W.
%e A173028 First four rows of R:
%e A173028 1...3....4....5.....16....19....22...25...28...
%e A173028 2...9....13...45....56....67....78...89...262..
%e A173028 6...29...43...57....186...223...260..297..334...
%e A173028 7...35...52...181...226...271...316..361..1063...
%e A173028 For example, row 3 begins with 6, which is the least positive
%e A173028 integer not in rows 1 and 2. Row 6 of W is (14,23,37,60,...)
%e A173028 Row 29 of W is (74,120,194,...) = 2*(37,60,97...).
%e A173028 Row 43 of W is (111,180,291,...) = 3*(37,60,97,...).
%e A173028 So row 3 of R begins with (6,29,43...) as there are no other rows
%e A173028 of W numbered <43 which are multiples of row 6 of W.

%E A173028 Corrections (these have been made): a(31) should read 223 instead of 225, a(63) 317 instead of 314 - _K. G. Stier_, Dec 21 2012
