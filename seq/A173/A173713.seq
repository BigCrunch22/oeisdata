%N A173713 Similar to A173065 but without the constraint that the sequence be increasing.
%C A173713 The sequence was computed by _D. S. McNeil_.
%C A173713 Comments on A173713 and A173065 from _Jack Brennen_, Sep 21 2010: (Start)
%C A173713 Note that the sequence A173713 reaches 9-digit numbers fairly quickly, at index 451, but out to index 12000, it still does not reach 10-digit numbers.
%C A173713 The sequence A173065 (strictly increasing) seems to grow fairly slowly, with occasional big jumps, which isn't really surprising, I guess. It reaches 9-digit numbers at index 8060, and then grows very slowly.
%C A173713 The fact that 9-digit numbers usually get the job done is due to the relative abundance of divisors of 10^9 + 1 (32 divisors).
%C A173713 Note that 10^15 + 1 has 128 divisors, and so it seems very unlikely to me that you could ever reasonably calculate the sequence far enough to the point where 15-digit numbers would not suffice... (End)
