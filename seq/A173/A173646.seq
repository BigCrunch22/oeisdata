%N A173646 Fixed points of the operation x->(max_d(x)+min_d(x))/2, where max_d(x) iteratively replaces each digit d of x from left to right with the largest of the d digits to its right (itself included), and similarly for min_d.
%C A173646 Note that for most x, min_d(x) + max_d(x) is even; multiples of 10 whose least significant nonzero digit is 3,5,7, or 9 appear to be exceptions.

%e A173646 The max_d and min_d operations work as follows.  Consider max_d(x) for x=723810; we read x from left to right, digit by digit.  We replace the 7 with the biggest of the 7 digits on its right (including itself), which is 8, producing 823810.  We replace the 2 with the biggest of the 2 digits on its right (including itself), so 2 is replaced by 3, producing 833810.  Applying the same rule to the third-digit 3 gives 838810; to the 8 gives 838810 (no change); the 1 is replaced by itself, again giving 838810; and then the 0 is replaced by the largest of the 0 digits to its right (including itself), but since there are none the 0 is replaced by nothing, giving 83881.  Therefore max_d(723810) = 83881.  min_d(x) works in similar fashion, but replacing each digit with the smallest digit to its right including itself.
%e A173646 The sequence consists of those x such that x = (min_d(x) + max_d(x))/2, such as 1519, where 1519 = (1119+1919)/2 = 3038/2 = 1519.
