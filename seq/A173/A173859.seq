%N A173859 Expansion of 6/5 in base phi.
%C A173859 In sequences A173856 to A173861 and A173864, which define base-phi, phi=A001622, expansions of 1+1/k, the length of the period of the digits (discarding the initial 1) is given by A001175(k). Here, with k=5, the period of length 20 is 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, coefficients in front of phi^(-1) to phi(-20). [From _R. J. Mathar_, Mar 15 2010]
