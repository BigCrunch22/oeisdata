%N A173821 The digital sum of a(n) is visible in the smallest a(n+1) not yet present in the sequence.
%C A173821 a(1) = 1, and for n > 1 a(n) is the smallest integer not yet present in the sequence such that the digital sum of a(n-1) is a substring of the decimal digits of a(n).

%e A173821 The digital sum of 1 is 1, so a(2) is the first unused number containing a "1", 10 (1 is already used). The digital sum of 10 is 1, so a(3) is the first unused number containing a "1", 11 (1 and 10 are already used)... The digital sum of 19 is 10, so a(20) is the first unused number containing a "10", 100 (10 is already used).
