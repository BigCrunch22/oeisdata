%N A173666 Partial sums of number of supersolvable groups of order n (A066083).
%C A173666 Number of supersolvable groups of order <= n. Diverges from A063756 after n=11. The subsequence of primes in this sequence begins: 2, 3, 5, 19, 23, 41, 47, 53, 79, 83, 89, 181, 191, 233, 241, 281, 293, 571, 577.  The subsequence of perfect powers in this sequence begins: 1, 8, 9, 16, 27, 144, 625.
%F A173666 a(n) = Sum_{i=1..n} A066083 = Sum_{i=1..n} number of finite groups of order i for which the index of any maximal subgroup is prime.
