%N A173759 Prime numbers p such that 1/p is in the Cantor set.
%C A173759 These are the prime numbers in A121153. Some of these primes are in A076481, the base-3 repunit primes, which have the form (3^n-1)/2. However, 757 has base-3 representation 1001001 and a base-27 representation 111. Are more exceptions?
%C A173759 Contains A076481 as a subsequence, implying that a(6) <= A076481(4) = 3754733257489862401973357979128773. - _Max Alekseyev_, Aug 17 2013
