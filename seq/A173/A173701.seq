%N A173701 Let S be the sequence and let D denote the sequence obtained by moving every third term three steps to the left. The D is the sequence of absolute values of the first differences of S.
%C A173701 We also require that S be a permutation of the natural numbers and the lexicographically earliest sequence with the stated propoerty.

%e A173701 Here is S:
%e A173701 S = ...1,3,2,5,9,4,13,19,6,25,32,7,39,47,8,55,65,10,75,86,11,97,109,12,121
%e A173701 The terms 2,4,6,7, ... move 3 places left.
%e A173701 After the moves we have:
%e A173701 D = .2,1,3,4,5,9,6,13,19,7,25,32,8,39,47,10,55,65,11,75,86,12,97,109,14,121
%e A173701 and D indeed gives the absolute values of the first differences of S.
