%N A173780 a(n) = largest number k such that k and k * n taken together have distinct digits, or 0 if no such k exists.
%C A173780 a(987654320) = 1 is the last nonzero term in sequence.
%e A173780 a(2) = 48651 because 48651 and 97302 (48651*2) taken together have distinct digits and there exists no larger number with this property.
