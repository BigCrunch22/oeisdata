%N A004724 Delete all 5's from the sequence of nonnegative integers.
%C A004724 In contrast to the variant A004180 where a(n) = 0 when all the digits of n are 5's, here a number completely disappears in that case, so that subsequent indices are shifted and for n > 4, a(n) is not the result of deleting 5's from n: see formula. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 13 2020
%F A004724 a(n) = A004180(n + m) where m = L(n) - [ (10^L(n)-1)/9*5 >= n + L(n) ], L(n) = floor(log_10(max(n,1)) + 1), the number of digits of n, and [...] is the Iverson bracket (1 if true, 0 else). - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 13 2020
%e A004724 From  _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 13 2020: (Start)
%e A004724 After a(4) = 4 comes a(5) = 6, since the number 5 completely disappears.
%e A004724 a(48) = 49 is followed by 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (i.e., 50, ..., 54 with the initial digit removed) and then a(54) = 6, because 55 disappears completely.
%e A004724 Illustration of the formula: as long as n < 5 (the first number that completely disappears) we have a(n) = A004180(n). Here n has 1 digit but n+1 does not exceed the (single repdigit) 5 (left hand side in the Iverson bracket), so m = 0. From n = 5 on, n+1 > 5, so m = 1.
%e A004724 Then, when n has L(n) = 2 digits, we still have n = 2 - 1 = 1 as long as n+2 <= 55 or n <= 53, but m = 3 for n > 55 - 2 = 53, i.e., from n = 54 on (where the term 55 has disappeared, see above).
%e A004724 Similarly, m = 3 for n > 555 - 3, i.e., from n >= 553 on, etc. (End)
