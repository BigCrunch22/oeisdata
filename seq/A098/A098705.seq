%N A098705 Coefficients in a certain Poincaré series [or Poincare series].
%C A098705 Let V=Sum_{k=1..infty} V_k be the graded vector space H_*(PC^infty)[1], which has Poincaré series [or Poincare series] p(t)=t/(1-t^2). Let L be the free graded Lie algebra V. There is a graded involution theta on V induced by an involution on PC^infty, which acts on V_{2k+1} as (-1)^k. The sequence gives the dimensions of the +1-eigenspaces of theta on the graded components of L.
