%N A098243 Numbers having the same number of primitive roots that are primes == 1 or 2 (mod 4) as primes == 3 (mod 4).
%C A098243 2 is counted with the primes 1 (mod 4) because it is a frequent prime primitive root and primes (1,2) (mod 4) together build sequence A002313.
%e A098243 31 has primitive roots 3, 11, 12, 13, 17, 21, 22, 24, ...;
%e A098243 13 and 17 are primes 1 (mod 4), count is 2;
%e A098243 3 and 11 are primes 3 (mod 4), count is 2;
%e A098243 thus 31 is a term of this sequence.
