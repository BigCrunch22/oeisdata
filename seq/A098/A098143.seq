%N A098143 Largest concatenation obtained by appending successively to n the least digit that forms a continuous succession of k-digit multiples of k, k=1,2,3,....
%F A098143 In the sequence, a(5)=501204240024885 and a(14)=1412040060249008 because we respectively have 1|5, 2|50, 3|501, 4|5012, ..., 15|501204240024885 and 1|1, 2|14, 3|141, ..., 16|1412040060249008 when the process halts.
%e A098143 To get a(1): appending 0 to 1 gives 10 which is a multiple of 2.
%e A098143 Appending a 2 to 10 gives 102 which is a multiple of 3.
%e A098143 Appending a 0 to 102 gives 1020 which is a multiple of 4.
%e A098143 Appending a 0 to 1020 gives 10200 which is a multiple of 5.
%e A098143 ...
%e A098143 Appending a 5 to 1020005640 gives 10200056405 which is a multiple of 11.
%e A098143 But now there is no digit x which makes 10200056405x a multiple of 12, so we stop, with a(1) = 10200056405. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 05 2016
