%N A098711 Write down decimal expansion of Pi; starting with 31, divide up into chunks of minimal length so that chunks are increasing numbers and do not begin with 0.
%C A098711 Seems to grow slower than A016062 (another sequence built on the same principle, which begins with 3, 14, 15, 92, 653...).
%e A098711 a(4) = 265, the three digits of Pi following a(3) = 59, because neither 2 nor 26 is > 59. a(13) = 75105820 even though 7510582 > a(12), because a(14) may not begin with a 0.
%Y A098711 Cf. A000796, A037244, A035331.
