%N A098079 Table(n,j) of the least k such that k*P(n)#/210-j and k*P(n)#/210-j+8 are consecutive primes, for n > 4 and j=7 to 1.
%C A098079 This is a fixed-width table, read by rows, with 7 columns, numbered j=7,6,...1. Since it is not an infinite square array or triangular table, the keyword "tabf" applies.

%e A098079 For n=5, P(5)#/210=11, and
%e A098079 36*11-7=389 and 397 are consecutive primes with gap of 8,
%e A098079 37*11-6=401 and 409 are consecutive primes with gap of 8,
%e A098079 44*11-5=479 and 487 are consecutive primes with gap of 8,
%e A098079 33*11-4=359 and 367 are consecutive primes with gap of 8,
%e A098079 64*11-3=701 and 709 are consecutive primes with gap of 8,
%e A098079 41*11-2=449 and 457 are consecutive primes with gap of 8,
%e A098079 180*11-1=1979 and 1987 are consecutives primes with gap of 8,
%e A098079 so the (first) row, for n=5, is: 36 37 44 33 64 41 180
%e A098079 The second row, for n=6, is: 60 43 92 39 118 11 30, and so on.
