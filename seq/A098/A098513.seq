%N A098513 Number of points (x,y) on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 + x + 1 (mod n), not including the point at infinity.
%C A098513 This is one of the simplest nondegenerate elliptic curves. By not including the point at infinity, we can see the multiplicative structure of this sequence. A theorem of Hasse states that, for prime n, the number of points (including the point at infinity) is n+1+d, where |d| < 2 sqrt(n). When a(n) is an odd prime, then n is prime.
