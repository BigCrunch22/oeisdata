%N A098709 a(n) = smallest positive multiple of (number of terms of {a(1), a(2), ..., a(n-1)} that are coprime to n) that is not among previous terms of sequence.
%C A098709 This sequence does not include all positive integers; the first few omitted values are 73, 163, 177, 197, 229. At n = 931, the number of noncomposite values in the sequence exceeds 77 and numbers in this range can be divisible by at most 4 distinct primes, so any value from that point on must exceed 73. (This is not quite a proof; there could stop being any prime values in the sequence until p_k primorial catches up with the difference, but it is obvious that this does not happen.) - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Jun 02 2006
%e A098709 a(8) is 9 because there are 3 terms of the sequence among the first 7 terms which are coprime to 8 and 9 is the smallest positive multiple of 3 not among the first 7 terms of the sequence.
