%N A098381 Difference between the number of odd entries and the number of even entries of the n-th row of the triangle A097883.
%C A098381 a(n+1)-a(n) is odd and alternates in sign (after the eleventh term), at least up through the 125th row.
%C A098381 |a(j+1)-a(j)| >= |a(i+1)-a(i)| for all j>=i and the absolute difference results in 11 ones, 9 threes, 1 five, 7 sevens, 2 nines, 1 eleven, 0 thirteens, 69 fifteens, 1 seventeen, etc.
%e A098381 a(6)=2 because the sixth row of the triangle A097883 has entries {14, 15, 16, 21, 23, 25}: 4 odd entries less 2 even entries.
