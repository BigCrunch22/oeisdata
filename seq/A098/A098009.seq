%I A098009
%S A098009 1,2,4,9,12,30,102,138
%N A098009 Numbers k such that the transient part of the aliquot sequence for k is finite and sets a new record.
%C A098009 In order to extend this there is the problem that there are small numbers (276, 552, etc.) for which it is not presently known if they cycle. I propose that we assume these do not cycle, but mark the records beyond where this becomes an issue as conjectural only.
%D A098009 See references and links in A098007, A098008.
%e A098009 138 has a transient of length 177 (see Guy's book).
