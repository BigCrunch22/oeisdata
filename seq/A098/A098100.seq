%N A098100 Write each non-Fibonacci integer >0 on a single label. Put the labels in numerical order to form an infinite sequence L. Now consider the succession of single digits of A000045 (Fibonacci numbers): 1 1 2 3 5 8 1 3 2 1 3 4 5 5 8 9 1 4 4 2 3 3 3 7 7 6 1 0 9... The sequence S gives a rearrangement of the labels that reproduces the same succession of digits, subject to the constraint that the smallest label must be used that does not lead to a contradiction.
%C A098100 This could be roughly rephrased like this: "Re-write in the most economical way the "Fibonacci pattern" using only non-Fibonacci numbers, but re-arranged. All the numbers of the sequence must be different one from another".
%e A098100 We must begin with 1,1,2... and we cannot represent "1" by 1 because this label doesn't exist (available labels carry only non-Fibonacci numbers), so the next possibility is the label "11". For 28657,46368,75025,... we cannot use label "75" in "28 65 74 63 68 75..." since no label begins with a 0. Labels of L cannot be used more than once.
