%N A098735 Numerator of sum of all matrix elements M(i,j) = i^2 + j^2 (i,j = 1..n) divided by n!.
%C A098735 This is a highly irregular sequence with high points belonging to hexagonal numbers A000384(n) = n*(2n-1) or second hexagonal numbers A014105(n) = n*(2n+1). All other elements of this sequence are equal to 1, n, (n+1) or (2n+1).
%C A098735 Numbers n such that a(n) = 1 are {24, 25, 27, 32, 34, 38, 45, 49, 55, 57, 62, 64, 76, 77, 80, 84, 85, 87, 91, 92, 93, 94, ...}. a(n) = n only iff n is prime such that 2n+1 is composite.
