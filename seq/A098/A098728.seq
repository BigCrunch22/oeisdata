%N A098728 Consider the sequence {b(n), n >= 1} of digits of the natural (or counting) numbers: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 2 0... (A007376); a(n) = n - b(n).
%C A098728 Subtract each digit of the counting numbers from its rank.
%H A098728 Harvey P. Dale, <a href="/A098728/b098728.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..1000</a>
%e A098728 The sequence of digits of the counting numbers is
%e A098728 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 1 9 2 0...
%e A098728 The 15th term, for instance, is a 2. Thus 15-2=13 is the 15th term of this sequence.
%e A098728 Next one is a 1, thus 16 (the rank) - 1 (the 16th digit of the decimal expansion of the counting numbers) = 15, which is the 16th term of this sequence.
%e A098728 Next one is 17-3=14
