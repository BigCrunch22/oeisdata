%e A098489 6 is 1+1+1+3, 1+1+2+2, 1+5, 2+4, 3+3 with even number of parts and no part more than thrice. Two of these partitions have one part occurring once or twice and (the middle) three have two such parts. The 6th row is therefore 0,2,3,0.
%Y A098489 Differs from A098490 in rows with triangular index. Cf. A098493.
%Y A098489 Row sums are in A098491.
