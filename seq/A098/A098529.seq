%N A098529 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) counts plane partitions of n+1 that can be 'shrunk' in k ways to a plane partition of n by removing 1 element from it. Equivalently, it counts how many partitions of n+1 have k different partitions of n it just covers.
%C A098529 Sequence starts 1; 3; 3,3; 6,6,1; 3,18,3; 9,24,15; 3,42,38,3; Row sums are A000219= the plane partitions of n+1 apart from offset. Sum(all k, k * T(n,k) ) = A090984(n) by definition. First column is A007425. Row lengths are A120565. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Jun 14 2006
%e A098529 T(4,1)=2 because the only plane partitions of 4+1=5 that can be shrunk in only 1 way to plane partitions of 4 are {{5}} and {{1},{1},{1},{1},{1}}, producing {{4}} and {{1},{1},{1},{1}} respectively.
%e A098529 T(4,1)=3 because the only plane partitions of 4+1=5 that can be shrunk in only 1 way to plane partitions of 4 are {{5}},{{1,1,1,1,1}} and {{1},{1},{1},{1},{1}}, producing {{4}},{{1,1,1,1}} and {{1},{1},{1},{1}} respectively.
