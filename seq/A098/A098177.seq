%N A098177 Start with the first n, which reads: "Prolong the sequence with n numbers having their parity opposed to n". Then read and obey the second n, then the third n, etc. This sequence is the slowest increasing one with such rule.
%e A098177 The first term, "1", means: "Add 1 even number to the sequence" - thus we write "2". We must now read and obey this "2": "Add 2 odd numbers to the sequence" - thus we write 3 and 5. We will then write 3 even numbers, followed by 5 even numbers (altogether 8 even numbers, thus "8" to "22"), etc.
