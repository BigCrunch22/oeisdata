%N A098921 Let [n] = {1,2,...,n}. Let G_n be the union of all closed line segments joining any two elements of [n] X [n] along a vertical or horizontal line, or along a line with slope +-1. Then a(n) = combined total of the number of (nondegenerate) triangles and rectangles for which all edges are subsets of G_n.
%C A098921 The vertices of these figures need not be in [n] X [n].
