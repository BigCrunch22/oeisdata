%N A098134 Number of triangles with corners on the integer lattice Z X Z (up to translations, rotations and reflections), the square of the longest side equal to A001481.
%e A098134 a(3) = 1 because there is only 1 triangle on the integer lattice Z*Z where the square of the longest side is equal to A001481(3) = 4; its a triangle with sides 2, sqrt(2), sqrt(2).
