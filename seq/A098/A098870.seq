%N A098870 Sum of the cubes of the digits of the previous term, starting with 2.
%C A098870 A student of mine (Dennis Vadner) noted this sequence when working with the sequence formed by summing the squares of the digits of the previous term for a class assignment. Upon investigating various initial terms, it was noted that there appeared to be a limited number of end behaviors.

%F A098870 G.f.: x*(342*x^7 + 24*x^6 - 645*x^5 + 42*x^4 + 378*x^3 - 504*x^2 - 6*x - 2) / (x - 1). - _Jinyuan Wang_, Mar 18 2020
%e A098870 Since a(5) = 92, a(6) is therefore 9^3 + 2^3 = 729 + 8 = 737.
