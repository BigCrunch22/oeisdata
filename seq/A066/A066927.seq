%N A066927 Least k such that between p and 2p, for all primes > 3, there is always a number that is twice a square, i.e.; a k such that p < 2k^2 < 2p.
%e A066927 a(5) = 3. The 5th prime is 11 and 2p is 22. The theorem says that there exists a number k, between p & 2p that is twice a square. 18 is between 11 & 22 and is of the form 2k^2, k being 3.
