%C A066615 An outgrowth of Goldbach's conjecture. "[I]n a letter to L. Euler (1742), C. F. Goldbach [asserted] that 'every odd number greater than 6 is equal to the sum of three primes.' Euler replied that Goldbach's conjecture was equivalent to the statement that every even number equal to or greater than 4 is equal to the sum of two primes. Because proving the second implies the first, but not the converse, most attention has been focused on the second representation. However, whether the statement is true for all even integers is still unsettled. Nevertheless, it is supported by existing evidence. A Russian mathematician, I. M. Vinogradov, proved that all large odd integers are the sum of three primes. Surprisingly, his techniques involve extremely subtle use of the theory of complex variables; no one has been able to extend them in order to solve Goldbach's conjecture." Andrews.
