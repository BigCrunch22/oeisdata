%N A066208 All primes that divide n are of the form prime(2k-1), where prime(k) is k-th prime.
%C A066208 The partitions into odd parts, encoded by their Heinz numbers. We define the Heinz number of a partition p = [p_1, p_2, ..., p_r] as Product(p_j-th prime, j=1...r) (concept used by _Alois P. Heinz_ in A215366 as an "encoding" of a partition). For example, for the partition [1, 1, 2, 4, 10] we get 2*2*3*7*29 = 2436. Example: 50 ( = 2*5*5) is in the sequence because it is the Heinz number of the partition [1, 3, 3]. - _Emeric Deutsch_, May 19 2015
%C A066208 From _Peter Munn_, Aug 11 2022: (Start)
%C A066208 Closed under multiplication.
%C A066208 Encodings, as defined in A206284, of even polynomials with nonnegative integer coefficients; so closed under application of A297845(.,.), which represents the multiplication of polynomials encoded this way.
%C A066208 (End)
%C A066208 For every positive integer m there exists a unique ordered pair of positive integers (j,k) such that m = a(j)*A066207(k). - _Christopher Scussel_, Aug 08 2023

%e A066208 20 is included because 20 = 2^2 * 5 = p(1)^2 * p(3) and 1 and 3 are both odd.
