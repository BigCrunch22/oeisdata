%N A066493 a(n) = least k such that f(k) = n, where f is the prime gaps function given by f(m) = prime(m+1)-prime(m) and prime(m) denotes the m-th prime, if k exists; 0 otherwise.
%C A066493 Obviously, a(n) = 0 for every odd n except 1. From the list, it appears that a(n) is nonzero for every even n; is this true in general? That is, for each even n, are there primes which differ by n?
%F A066493 a(2*n) = A038664(n). - _Michel Marcus_, Apr 29 2023
%e A066493 a(6) = 9 since k = 9 is the smallest k making prime(k+1)-prime(k) = 6.
%e A066493 a(3) = 0 since no two consecutive primes differ by 3.
