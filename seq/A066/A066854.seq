%N A066854 a(n) = Sum_{k=1..8} 2^(8-k) * c(16n+2k+1), where c(j) is 1 if j is composite, 0 if j is prime.
%C A066854 Related to a computer implementation of the sieve of Eratosthenes: Each positive odd number is represented by a bit: 0 if it is prime, 1 if it is composite. The term a(n) contains the 8 bits corresponding to the odd numbers from 16n+3 to 16n+17.

%e A066854 In binary, a(0)=00010010, which means that among the odd numbers 3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17, only 9 and 15 are composite.
