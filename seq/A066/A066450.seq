%N A066450 a(n) is the conjectured value of the minimal number to which repeated application of the "reverse and add!" algorithm in base n does not terminate in a palindrome. If there is no such number in base n, then a(n) := -1.
%C A066450 It would be nice to remove the word "Conjectured" from the description. - _N. J. A. Sloane_
%C A066450 All the terms in this sequence except the first are only conjectures. (See Walker, Irvin on a(10)=196 and Brockhaus on a(2)=22.)
%C A066450 An obvious algorithm is: start with r := n and check whether the "reverse and add!" algorithm in base n halts in a palindrome or not. If it stops, increment r by one and repeat the process, else return r. To obtain the values above, an upper limit of 100 "reverse and add!" steps was used.
%C A066450 Conjectures: a(n) shows the same asymptotic behavior as n^2. For infinitely many n, a(n) = n^2 - n - 1. Again, it is an open question, if the values of the sequence really lead to infinitely many "reverse and add!" steps or not. Is the sequence always positive?

%E A066450 _David W. Wilson_ remarks (Jan 02 2002): I verified these using 1000 digits as a stopping point (this would be >>1000 iterations). I am highly confident of these values.
