%N A066349 A self-generating sequence: let S = {}, a(0) = 333; for n >= 1, factorize a(n-1), arrange prime factors in increasing order and append their digits to S; then a(n) is the 3-digit number formed from terms 3n, 3n+1, 3n+2 of S. Leading zeros are omitted from a(n).
%C A066349 333 is the unique 3-digit starting value that produces nontrivial sequences. This is one of the two possible continuations if one starts with 333. For the other see A066801.
%e A066349 The factorizations of the first few terms are 3*3*37, 3*5*7*7, 5*5*31, 3*3*59, 5*67, 2*2*239, ... Thus S = [3,3,3,7,3,5,7,7,5,...] and grouping these in sets of three we recover the sequence.
