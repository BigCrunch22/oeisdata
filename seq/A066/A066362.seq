%N A066362 a(n) = least k > n such that phi(k) < phi(n), if such a k exists; otherwise a(n) = 0.
%C A066362 If a(n) = 0, then from n onwards, phi will not go below its value at n.
%C A066362 The first odd term in this sequence is a(314) = 315. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Oct 25 2006
%e A066362 a(2) = 0 since there is no k > 2 for which phi(k) < 1 = phi(2). a(5) = 6 since for k = 6, phi(6) = 2 < 4 = phi(5).
