%N A066050 Average of divisors of n (sigma(n)/d(n)) is greater than average of divisors for all k < n.
%C A066050 Contribution from _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Apr 13 2010: (Start)
%C A066050 For composite n to be a member of the sequence, it must be in a prime gap of length > (p+2)/3 or the average of the divisors of p will be at least as great.
%C A066050 An unpublished paper of Kyle D. Balliet proves that, for n >= 3, there is a prime in [3n, 4n].
%C A066050 If p > 5 is a prime congruent to 2 mod 3, then there is a prime in [p+1, 4(p+1)/3] and hence the associated gap is at most (p+1)/3.
%C A066050 If p > 7 is a prime congruent to 1 mod 3, then there is a prime in [p+2, 4(p+2)/3] and hence the associated gap is at most (p+2)/3 as desired.
%C A066050 Thus if n > 11 is a member of this sequence, n is prime. As a result, a(n) = prime(n-4) for n >= 9.
