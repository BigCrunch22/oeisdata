%N A066426 Conjectured values for a(n) = least natural number k such that phi(n+k) = phi(n) + phi(k), if k exists; otherwise 0.
%C A066426 It would be nice to remove the word "Conjectured" from the description. - _N. J. A. Sloane_
%C A066426 The values of a(3), a(15) and a(21) listed above, namely 0, are conjectural. There is no natural number k < 10^6 satisfying the "homomorphic condition" phi(n+k) = phi(n) + phi(k) for n = 3, 15, 21.
%C A066426 The terms for which there is no solution k < 10^6 are n = 3, 15, 21, 39, 45, 57, 69, 105, 147, 165, 177, 195, 213, 273, 285,..., which satisfy n=3 (mod 6). - _T. D. Noe_, Jan 20 2004
%C A066426 All n < 2000 and k < 10^8 have been tested. Sequence A110172 gives the n for which there is no solution k < 10^8. For n=1 (mod 3) or n=2 (mod 3), it appears that the least solution k satisfies k<=2n. For n=0 (mod 3), the least k, if it exists, can be greater than 2n. - _T. D. Noe_, Jul 15 2005
