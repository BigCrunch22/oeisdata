%N A066879 n such that there are as many 1's as 0's in the base 2 expansion of Floor(n/2).
%C A066879 n such that there are as many odd as even terms in the orbit f(n), f(f(n)), f(f(f(n))), ..., 1, where f(k) = Floor(k/2).
%F A066879 A037861(Floor(n/2)) = 0.
%e A066879 floor(18/2) = 9 = 1001 (base 2) has the same number of 1's as 0's. So 18 is a term of the sequence.
%e A066879 Also the orbit corresponding to 18 is 9, 4, 2, 1, which has an equal number (i.e. 2) of odd and even terms.
