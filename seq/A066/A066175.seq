%N A066175 Numbers k such that sigma(phi(sigma(k))) = k.
%C A066175 If n=2^k-1, where either k=1, or n is a Mersenne prime (A000668), or sigma(n)=3*2^(k-1), then n is in the sequence; are there any terms not of these forms? The last form includes the terms 15 and 1023; are there others like this?
%C A066175 Is this sequence infinite?
%C A066175 It is conjectured that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes. So this conjecture also supports that this sequence is infinite. Additionally, if n=2^k-1, where either k=1, or n is a Mersenne prime (A000668), or sigma(n)=3*2^(k-1), then A000217(n) divides sigma(A000217(n)). - _Altug Alkan_, Jul 25 2016
