%N A066297 Number of ternary squarefree necklaces.
%C A066297 A square is an adjacent pair of repeats, e.g., "aa" or "abcabc". A necklace is a word that may be rotated before being tested (for squares).
%C A066297 Several similar sequences (with same zeros) can be constructed from equivalence classes of the loops.
%C A066297 Higher terms: a(n) > 0 for 30 < n <= 56; no zeros known after a(17).
%C A066297 This is also the number of ternary "circular" squarefree words.  The Currie paper proves no 0 entries after a(17). - _Jeffrey Shallit_, Jul 11 2012
%H A066297 J. D. Currie, <a href="http://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v9i1n10">There are ternary circular square-free words of length n for n >= 18</a>, Elect. J. Combinatorics 9 (2002), Paper N10.
%e A066297 a(1)=3, size of {"a","b","c"); a(6)=18, size of {"abacbc","bacbca",...,"cbabca"}.
%Y A066297 Variant of A006156. See also A001037, A006206.
