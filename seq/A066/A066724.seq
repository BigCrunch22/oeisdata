%N A066724 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 1, a(n) is the least integer > a(n-1) such that the products a(i)*a(j) for 1 <= i < j <= n are all distinct.
%C A066724 The first 15 terms are the same as A026477; the first 13 terms are the same as A026416.

%e A066724 a(7) is not 10 because we already have 10 = 2*5. Of course all primes appear. a(14) is not 24 because if it were there would be a repeat among the terms a(i)*a(j) for 1 <= i < j <= 14, namely 3*16 = 2*24.
