%N A352419 Triangle read by rows T(n,k): number of three-in-a-rows in n-dimensional tic-tac-toe through a cell that is central in k dimensions (for k=0..n).
%C A352419 A tic-tac-toe board in n dimensions consists of 3^n cells. Each cell is central (between others) in k dimensions and extremal (not between others) in n-k dimensions. In standard n=2 tic-tac-toe, k=0 gives a corner, k=2 gives the center, and k=1 gives an edge.
%C A352419 A000225 gives the first term in each row: a(n) is the number of three-in-a-rows passing through corner cells in n-dimensional tic-tac-toe = 2^n - 1.
%C A352419 A003462 gives the final term in each row: a(n) is the number of three-in-a-rows passing through the center cell in n-dimensional tic-tac-toe = (3^n - 1)/2.
%C A352419 A007051 gives the penultimate term in each row: a(n) is the number of three-in-a-rows passing through a cell in n-dimensional tic-tac-toe that is central in n - 1 dimensions and extremal in 1 dimension = (3^(n-1))/2 + 1.
%C A352419 A170804 gives the minimum of each row: a(n) is the smallest number of three-in-a-rows passing through any cell in n-dimensional tic-tac-toe.
%C A352419 A094374 -1 gives the central values of even rows: a(n) - 1 is the number of three-in-a-rows passing through a cell in 2n-dimensional tic-tac-toe that is central in n dimensions and extremal in n dimensions = (2^n - 1) + (3^n - 1)/2.
%F A352419 T(n,k) = (3^k - 1)/2 + 2^(n-k) - 1.
