%N A352491 n minus the Heinz number of the conjugate of the integer partition with Heinz number n.
%C A352491 The Heinz number of a partition (y_1,...,y_k) is prime(y_1)*...*prime(y_k). This gives a bijective correspondence between positive integers and integer partitions.
%C A352491 Problem: What is the image? In the nonnegative case it appears to start: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, ...
%F A352491 a(n) = n - A122111(n).
%e A352491 The partition (4,4,1,1) has Heinz number 196 and its conjugate (4,2,2,2) has Heinz number 189, so a(196) = 196 - 189 = 7.
