%N A352774 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not appeared that does not share a factor with a(n-2) + a(n-1) or a(n-2)*a(n-1).
%C A352774 As a(2) is even, which forces a(3) and a(4) to be odd, all following terms will be odd as the sum of two odd terms is even. Beyond a(5) = 7 all subsequent primes appear in their natural order.
%H A352774 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A352774/a352774.png">Image of the first 5000 terms</a>. The green line is y = n.
%e A352774 a(2) = 5 as a(1) + a(2) = 3, a(1)*a(2) = 2, and 5 is the smallest unused number that does not share a factor with 3 or 2.
