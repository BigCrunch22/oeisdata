%N A352633 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers such for any n > 0, a(n) and a(n+1) are coprime and have no common 1-bits in their binary expansions.
%C A352633 This sequence combines features of A000027 (where two consecutive terms are coprime) and of A109812 (where two consecutive terms have no common 1-bits in their binary expansions).
%C A352633 For any n > 0, n and a(n) have the same parity.
%C A352633 The sequence is well defined:
%C A352633 - after an odd term v: we can extend the sequence with a power of 2 greater than any previous term,
%C A352633 - after an even term v < 2^k: we can extend the sequence with a prime number of the form 1 + t*2^k (Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions guarantees us that there is an infinity of such prime numbers).
%C A352633 This sequence is a permutation of the positive integers (with inverse A353604):
%C A352633 - the sequence is clearly unbounded,
%C A352633 - so we have even terms of infinitely many different binary lengths,
%C A352633 - the first even term with binary length w > 1 is necessarily 2^(w-1),
%C A352633 - so we have infinitely many powers of 2 in the sequence,
%C A352633 - so eventually all odd numbers will appear in the sequence,
%C A352633 - and all prime numbers will appear in the sequence,
%C A352633 - and eventually any even number v < 2^k must appear in the sequence (for instance after a prime number of the form 1 + t*2^k).
