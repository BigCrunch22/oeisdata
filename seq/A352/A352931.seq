%C A352931 From _Michael De Vlieger_, May 04 2022: (Start)
%C A352931 Zeros in this sequence correspond to fixed points in A093714.
%C A352931 Sequence exhibits intervals where terms have same parity. Parity changes when a run of odd terms in A093714 with even run length occurs. These runs begin with A093714(A351498(k)). Conjecture: the last parity change begins with a(1036044) = -9. (End)
%C A352931 Rival conjecture: The parity changes infinitely often. This would imply that A352932 contains infinitely many terms. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 04 2022
