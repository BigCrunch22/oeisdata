%N A352719 Indices k of tribonacci numbers T(k) such that T(k+1) - (tribonacci constant)*T(k) is nonnegative.
%C A352719 The tribonacci constant, which is approximately 1.839, is described in A058265. The tribonacci constant is the only real solution to the characteristic equation (x^3 = x^2+x+1) for the tribonacci sequence. It describes the asymptotic growth of the tribonacci sequence.
%C A352719 The sequence doesn't contain three consecutive numbers. Also, the difference between two consecutive numbers is never more than 3.
%e A352719 T(6) = 7 and T(7) = 13. Therefore, T(7) - (tribonacci constant)*T(6) equals approximately 0.127 > 0. Thus, index 6 is in this sequence.
