%N A352200 a(0)=0, a(1)=1; thereafter, a(n) is the smallest number m not yet in the sequence such that the binary expansions of m and a(n-1) have a 1 in the same position, but the positions of the 1's in the binary expansions of m and a(n-2) are disjoint, except that the second condition is ignored if it would imply that no choice for m were possible.
%C A352200 The second condition is ignored precisely when the positions of the 1's in a(n-1) are a subset of the 1's in a(n-2).
%C A352200 This is a set-theory analog of A352187.

%e A352200 a(0)=0 and a(1)=1=1_2 are given.
%e A352200 a(2) = 3 = 11_2 is disjoint from a(0) and intersects a(1).
%e A352200 a(3) = 2 = 10_2 is disjoint from a(1) and intersects a(2).
%e A352200 Now there is no choice for a(4) that meets both conditions, so we ignore the no-intersection-with-a(n-2) condition, and take a(4) = 6 = 110_2.
