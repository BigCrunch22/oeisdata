%N A352976 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not appeared that shares a factor with max(a(n-2),a(n-1)).
%C A352976 Although all primes likely appear they do not occur in their natural order, e.g., 37 appears before 31. In the range studied each time a prime appears, beyond the initial 2, the previous term is a multiple of the same prime. The largest multiple in the first 500000 terms is six, first occurring at a(7782) = 8286, a(7783) = 1381. It is unknown if this ratio is unbounded for large n. As a prime term is less than its previous term the term following the prime will share a factor with previous multiple of the prime. This factor appears to always be a factor of the multiple and thus the term is not another multiple of the prime.
%C A352976 In the first 500000 terms the fixed points are 1, 2, 15, 25, 35. It is likely no more exist. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
