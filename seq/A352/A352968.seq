%N A352968 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not appeared that shares a factor with min(a(n-2),a(n-1)).
%C A352968 Although all primes likely appear they do not occur in their natural order, e.g., 17 appears before 13. In the range studied each time a prime appears, beyond the initial 2 and 3, the next term is a multiple of the same prime. The largest multiple in the first 500000 terms is eight, first occurring at a(446271) = 64403, a(446272) = 515224. It is unknown if this ratio is unbounded for large n. Similarly the smaller of the two terms before a prime is a multiple of the prime. The largest ratio found being seven, first occurring at a(446271) = 64403, the same term as above.
%C A352968 In the first 500000 terms there are thirty-eight fixed points - 1, 2, 3, 4, 14, 32, 85, ..., 3277, 8651, 9223. It is likely no more exist. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
