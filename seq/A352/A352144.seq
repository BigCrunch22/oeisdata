%N A352144 The number of interior points that are intersections of exactly two chords for a 2n-gon where all its vertices are joined by lines (cf. A006561).
%C A352144 For the (2n+1)-gon the number of interior simple intersections is given by binomial(n,4) as all interior points are simple. For the 2n-gon, this sequence, no such formula is currently known.
%C A352144 See A335102 for images of the 2n-gons.
