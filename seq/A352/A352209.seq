%N A352209 Largest number of maximal perfect node-induced subgraphs of an n-node graph.
%C A352209 This sequence is log-superadditive, i.e., a(m+n) >= a(m)*a(n). By Fekete's subadditive lemma, it follows that the limit of a(n)^(1/n) exists and equals the supremum of a(n)^(1/n).
%F A352209 a(m+n) >= a(m)*a(n).
%F A352209 Limit_{n->oo} a(n)^(1/n) >= 42^(1/9) = 1.51482... .
%e A352209 All graphs with at most four nodes are perfect, so a(n) = 1 for n <= 4 and any graph is optimal.
%e A352209 All optimal graphs (i.e., graphs that have n nodes and a(n) maximal perfect subgraphs) for 5 <= n <= 9 are listed below. Since a graph is perfect if and only if its complement is perfect, the optimal graphs come in complementary pairs.
%e A352209   n = 5: the 5-cycle;
%e A352209   n = 6: the wheel graph with any subset of the spokes removed (8 graphs in total);
%e A352209   n = 7: the chestahedral graph and its complement;
%e A352209   n = 8: the bislit cube graph, the snub disphenoidal graph, and their complements;
%e A352209   n = 9: the bislit cube graph with an additional node with edges to two neighboring nodes of degree 4 and to the two nodes of degree 3 on the opposite face of the cube, the snub disphenoidal graph with an additional node with edges to the four nodes of degree 4, and their complements.
