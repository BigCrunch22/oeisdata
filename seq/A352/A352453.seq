%N A352453 Decimal expansion of the area of intersection of 4 unit-radius circles that have the vertices of a unit-side square as centers.
%C A352453 The solution to a problem in Jones (1932): "At each corner of a garden, surrounded by a wall n yards square, a goat is tied with a rope n yards long. Find the area of the part of the garden common to the four goats." (When the square is taken to be of unit size, the common area is this constant.)
%C A352453 The perimeter of the shape formed by the intersection is 2*Pi/3 (A019693).
%C A352453 The solution to the three-dimensional version of this problem is A352454.
