%N A352957 Triangle read by rows: Row n is the lexicographically earliest strictly monotonic completely additive sequence of length n.
%C A352957 Each sequence consists of nonnegative integers indexed from 1.
%C A352957 Note in particular in the formula section, the lower bound, floor(n/k), for first differences between terms in a row. This follows (using the additive property) from the strict monotonicity of floor(n/k)+1 consecutive terms near the end of the row.
%C A352957 For any k, with increasing length n >= k, the first k terms of the sequences approach similarity with a real-valued logarithmic function defined on the integers. For example, the asymptote of T(n,3)/T(n,2) is log(3)/log(2), A020857.

%F A352957 The definition specifies: T(n,j*k) = T(n,j) + T(n,k); for k > 1, T(n,k) > T(n,k-1).
%F A352957 T(n,1) = 0, otherwise T(n,k) >= T(n,k-1) + floor(n/k).
%F A352957 For prime p, T(p,p) = T(p-1,p-1) + 1, otherwise T(p,k) = T(p-1,k).
%F A352957 T(n,2) >= 2*floor(n/4) + floor(n/9).
%F A352957 T(n,3) >= ceiling( (3*T(n,2) + floor(n/9)) / 2).
%F A352957 T(11,k) = A344443(k).
%F A352957 For k <> 13, T(23,k) = A344444(k).
%e A352957 (For row 4.) A completely additive sequence requires T(4,1) = 0. Strict monotonicity requires T(4,4) > T(4,3) > T(4,2). So T(4,4) >= T(4,2) + 2. Using the additivity this becomes T(4,2) + T(4,2) >= T(4,2) + T(4,1) + 2. Subtracting T(4,2) and substituting 0 for T(4,1) we get T(4,2) >= 2. So from T(4,4) > T(4,3) > T(4,2), we see T(4,3) >= 3, T(4,4) >= 4. So row 4 = (0, 2, 3, 4) as it is strictly monotonic and completely additive and from the preceding arguments is seen to be the lexicographically earliest such.
