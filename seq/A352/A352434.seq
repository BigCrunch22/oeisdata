%N A352434 The number of simple vertices on a diagonal of a regular 2n-gon when all its vertices are connected by lines and where the diagonal passes through the center of the 2n-gon.
%C A352434 Excluding a(2), which has its simple vertex at the center of the 4-gon, the terms predominantly follow a pattern of pairs of two equal numbers and where the pair values increment by two. The second term of each pair corresponds to 2n-gons where n is a multiple of 2. These 2n-gons have two vertices that are on the same horizontal line as the central non-simple vertex thus the line joining them will not form a new simple vertex with the central vertical diagonal. Therefore in general a(2*k) = a(2*k-1), k>=1. However this rule is broken when n is a multiple of 12 - for these 2n-gons two of the horizontal lines connecting the left-side and right-side vertices also intersect two non-central diagonals and thus two simple vertices are removed. See the linked image of the 24-gon.

%e A352434 a(2) = 1 as the 4-gon (square) has one simple vertex at its center when all its vertices are connected by lines.
%e A352434 a(3) = 2 as the 6-gon (hexagon) has two simple vertices along the central diagonal when its vertices are connected by lines. See the linked image.
%e A352434 a(7) = 6 as the 14-gon has six simple vertices along the central diagonal when its vertices are connected by lines. See the linked image.
