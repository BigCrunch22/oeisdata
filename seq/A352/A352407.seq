%N A352407 The number of terms before reaching zero when starting at n and iterating: f(n) = n, f(n+1) = n+1; f(n+k) = (f(n+k-2) * f(n+k-1)) (mod (n+k)), where k>=2.
%C A352407 This sequences uses the same iterative formula as A352406 except that the two previous terms are multiplied instead of added. See that sequence for further details.
%C A352407 In the first 500000 terms the largest value is a(409758) = 1480452. In the same range the smallest number greater than 1 not to have appeared is 16291, although it is likely all numbers eventually appear.
%e A352407 a(0) = 2 as starting at 0 and 1 gives 0*1 % 2 = 0, with two terms before reaching zero. This is the smallest possible value and the only term to equal 2.
%e A352407 a(2) = 14 as starting at 2 and 3 gives 2*3 % 4 = 2, 3*2 % 5 = 1, 2*1 % 6 = 2, 1*2 % 7 = 2, 2*2 % 8 = 4, 2*4 % 9 = 8, 4*8 % 10 = 2, 8*2 % 11 = 5, 2*5 % 12 = 10, 5*10 % 13 = 11, 10*11 % 14 = 12, 11*12 % 15 = 12, 12*12 % 16 = 0, with fourteen terms before reaching zero.
%e A352407 a(3) = 5 as starting at 3 and 4 gives 3*4 % 5 = 2, 4*2 % 6 = 2, 2*2 % 7 = 4, 2*4 % 8 = 0, with five terms before reaching zero.
