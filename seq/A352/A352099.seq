%N A352099 Number of inequivalent {-1,1} matrices of order n, up to permutation of rows and/or columns and multiplication of rows and/or columns by -1.
%C A352099 The equivalence operations described in the title are commonly used when discussing Hadamard matrices, for example (see A007299). See A353052 for the version of this sequence that also considers transposition as part of the equivalence relation.
%C A352099 Since the row and column multiplication operations can be used to force the first row and column to consist only of ones, 2^((n-1)^2) is an upper bound on this sequence. A lower bound is 2^((n-1)^2) / (n!)^2.
%Y A352099 Cf. A111368, A353052.
