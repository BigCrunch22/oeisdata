%N A352965 A variant of Van Eck's sequence where we only consider prime numbers: for n >= 0, if a(n) = a(n-p) for some prime number p, take the least such p and set a(n+1) = p; otherwise a(n+1) = 0. Start with a(1) = 0.
%C A352965 Will every prime number appear in the sequence?
%e A352965 a(1) = 0 by definition.
%e A352965 a(2) = 0 as there is only one occurrence of a(1) = 0 so far.
%e A352965 a(3) = 0 as a(2) <> a(2-p) for any admissible prime p.
%e A352965 a(4) = 2 as a(3) = a(3-2).
%e A352965 a(5) = 0 as there is only one occurrence of a(4) = 2 so far.
%e A352965 a(6) = 2 as a(5) = a(5-2).
%e A352965 a(7) = 2 as a(6) = a(6-2).
%e A352965 a(8) = 3 as a(7) <> a(7-2) and a(7) = a(7-3).
%o A352965 (PARI) { for (n=1, #a=vector(82), forprime (p=2, n-2, if (a[n-1]==a[n-1-p], a[n]=p; break)); print1 (a[n]", ")) }
