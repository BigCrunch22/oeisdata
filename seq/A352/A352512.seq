%N A352512 Number of fixed points in the n-th composition in standard order.
%C A352512 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions. See also A000120, A059893, A070939, A114994, A225620.
%C A352512 A fixed point of composition c is an index i such that c_i = i.
%F A352512 A000120(n) = A352512(n) + A352513(n).
%e A352512 The 169th composition in standard order is (2,2,3,1), with fixed points {2,3}, so a(169) = 2.
%t A352512 stc[n_]:=Differences[Prepend[Join@@ Position[Reverse[IntegerDigits[n,2]],1],0]]//Reverse;

%Y A352512 The version counting permutations is A008290, unfixed A098825.
%Y A352512 The triangular version is A238349, first column A238351.
%Y A352512 Unfixed points are counted by A352513, triangle A352523, first A352520.
%Y A352512 A011782 counts compositions.
%Y A352512 A088902 gives the fixed points of A122111, counted by A000700.
