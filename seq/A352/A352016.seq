%N A352016 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers such that a(n) written on top of a(n+1) forms a correct 2-integer brick (see the Comments and Example sections for an explanation).
%C A352016 a(15) = 39 and a(16) = 217; when we write a(15) on top of a(16) we form the "brick":
%C A352016 .39
%C A352016 217
%C A352016 From left to right we read (vertically) the three integers 2, 31 and 97 which are prime and thus achieve a correct 2-integer brick.
