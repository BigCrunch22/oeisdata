%N A352427 a(n) is the number of trailing 0's in the minimal representation of n in terms of the positive Pell numbers (A317204).
%C A352427 The asymptotic density of the occurrences of 0 is sqrt(2)-1 and of the occurrences of k = 1, 2, ... is 2*(sqrt(2)-1)^(k+1).
%C A352427 The asymptotic mean of this sequence is 1 and its asymptotic variance is sqrt(2).
