%N A352540 Values for which the iteration of A352544 (half if even, add largest anagram if odd) does not end in a loop.
%C A352540 The iterated map A352544 is a variant of the Collatz map, A352544(x) = x/2 if x is even, A352544(x) = x + A004186(x) (add x with digits in decreasing order) if x is odd.
%C A352540 All the terms are only conjectured to have this property; we don't have a completely rigorous proof. But for all the listed initial terms, the trajectory quickly reaches numbers with many (>> 10) digits and grows larger with every iteration: When the number is odd and has a digit 0, then its successor is again odd and at least twice as large, most often more than 9 times larger. Roughly 1/10th of the digits are zeros, and similarly for 9s, so as the terms get larger, it becomes increasingly less probable that they could end up having no digit 0 at all, which is only a necessary condition that they might become even and not grow upon for one iteration, but still most likely resume growth immediately after. See sequence A352542, the trajectory of a(1) = 89, for an example studied in detail.
