%N A352298 Conjectured largest number that can be expressed as the sum of two primes in exactly n ways or -1 if no such number exists.
%C A352298 Conjecture A in page 32 of the Hardy and Littlewood reference implies that a(n) != -1 for all n > 1. While the sequence is not monotonic, the plot of n versus a(n)/log(a(n))^2 has a linear trend which matches with the formula for the number of representations in Conjecture A.
