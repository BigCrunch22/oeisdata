%N A352245 a(0) = 1; for n >= 1, a(n) = the decimal value of the binary number of the index of where n first appears in the concatenation of all previous binary terms. If the binary value of n has not previously appeared then a(n) = 0.
%C A352245 In the first 250000 terms the longest run of consecutive 0 terms is seven, the first occurrence of which starts at a(43). It is unknown if longer runs exists. See the companion sequence A352246 for the indices where a(n) = 0.

%e A352245 a(1) = 1 as the binary string concatenation up to a(0) = '1', and the binary value of 1 is '1' which appears at index 1 in the string.
%e A352245 a(2) = 0 as the binary string concatenation up to a(1) = '11', while the binary value of 2 is '10' which does not appear in the string.
%e A352245 a(3) = 1 as the binary string concatenation up to a(2) = '110', and the binary value of 3 is '11' which appears at index 1 in the string.
%e A352245 a(5) = 2 as the binary string concatenation up to a(4) = '11010', and the binary value of 5 is '101' which appears at index 2 in the string.
