%N A352097 a(1) = 4, a(2) = 9; let i = a(n-2) and j = a(n-1); a(n) = least k not already in the sequence such that gcd(j, k) = 1 and 1 < gcd(i, k) != i != k.
%C A352097 Variant of A098550 analogous to A240024 and its relationship to A064413.
%C A352097 Theorem: the sequence is in composites. Proof: Prime k must either divide or be coprime to i, but 1 < gcd(i, k) != k precludes k | i. Therefore there is no avenue for primes in the sequence.
%C A352097 All i and k must have an "unrelated" (neither coprime nor divisor, i.e., neutral) relationship in the sense of A045763.
%C A352097 Theorem: if prime p | j then p does not divide k. Consequence of coprimality axiom gcd(j, k) = 1. Hence, even terms are nonadjacent in the sequence. Therefore we begin this sequence with {4, 9}.
%C A352097 A version of Yellowstone sequence S = A098550 that strips out features attributable to prime S(n) and their cototient successors S(n+2). In S, those 2 groups produce quasi-rays in scatterplot that have primes appear late and their successors early in S.
%C A352097 Composite quasi-rays in the Yellowstone sequence scatterplot are retained, bifurcated according to parity for same reasons as in that sequence.
%C A352097 Conjecture: permutation of the composite numbers.
