%N A352017 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers such that a(n) written on top of a(n+1) which in turn is written on top of a(n+2) form a correct 3-integer brick (see the Comments and Example sections for an explanation).

%e A352017 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2 and a(3) = 7 stacked form the prime number 127, which is what we want;
%e A352017 a(2) = 2, a(3) = 7 and a(4) = 21 stacked form the hereunder "brick":
%e A352017 .2
%e A352017 .7
%e A352017 21
%e A352017 From left to right we read (vertically) the two integers 2 and 271 which are prime and thus achieve a correct 3-integer brick;
%e A352017 a(3) = 7, a(4) = 21 and a(5) = 9 stacked form the hereunder "brick":
%e A352017 .7
%e A352017 21
%e A352017 .9
%e A352017 From left to right we read (vertically) the two integers 2 and 719 which are prime and thus achieve a correct 3-integer brick;

%e A352017 .997
%e A352017 1771
%e A352017 From left to right we read (vertically) the four integers 11, 797, 397 and 971 which are prime and thus achieve a correct 3-integer brick; etc.
