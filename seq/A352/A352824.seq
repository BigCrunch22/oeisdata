%N A352824 Number of fixed points y(i) = i, where y is the integer partition with Heinz number n.
%C A352824 The Heinz number of a partition (y_1,...,y_k) is prime(y_1)*...*prime(y_k). This gives a bijective correspondence between positive integers and integer partitions.
%C A352824 Conjecture: The mean approaches 1/4.

%F A352824 a(n) = A001222(n) - A352825(n).
%e A352824 The partition (3,2,2,1) has Heinz number 90, and when indexing the parts from left to right as k=1..4, then at k=2 we have y(k) = k [and nowhere else], therefore a(90) = 1. The partition (3,3,1,1) has Heinz number 100, with parts y(1) = 3, y(2) = 3, y(3) = 1, y(4) = 1, and as there are no such k that y(k) = k, we have a(100) = 0.
