%N A352712 a(n) is the smallest prime p(1) in a symmetrical constellation of at least n consecutive pairs of cousin primes: p(1), p(1) + 4, ..., p(n), p(n) + 4.
%C A352712 A cousin prime pair is a pair of primes that differ by 4.
%C A352712 a(7) and a(8) were found in the T. Brada Experimental Grid BOINC project.
