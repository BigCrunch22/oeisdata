%N A352810 Values taken both by sigma (A000203) and by antisigma (A024816), where sigma is the sum of divisors function and antisigma is the sum of the non-divisors of n less than n function.
%C A352810 Common values attained by sigma and antisigma functions, in ascending order.
%C A352810 The asymptotic density of this sequence is 0 (according to 2nd comment of A002191).
%C A352810 The smallest integers k and m such that sigma(k) = antisigma(m) = a(n) are in A352811.
%e A352810 As sigma(31) = 1+31 = 32 and antisigma(9) = 1+2+4+5+6+7+8 = 32, then 32 is a term.
%t A352810 m = 10^4; r = Range[m]; s = DivisorSigma[1, r]; as = r*(r + 1)/2 - s; Select[Intersection[s, as], # <= m &] (* _Amiram Eldar_, Apr 05 2022 *)
%Y A352810 Intersection of A002191 and A231365.
