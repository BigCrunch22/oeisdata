%N A352768 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not appeared that shares a factor with both a(n-2)+a(n-1) and a(n-2)*a(n-1).
%C A352768 In the first 250000 terms the lowest number not to appear is 811; it is likely this sequence is a permutation of the positive integers. In this range the fixed points are 1, 2, 4, 35, 6731, 167821. It is possible more exist although this is unknown. In the same range the longest runs of consecutive even terms and odd terms is 29 and 33 respectively. This suggests such runs are likely arbitrarily long.
