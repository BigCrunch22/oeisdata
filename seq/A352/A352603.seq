%N A352603 a(1) = 2; a(2) = 3; for n >= 3, a(n) = a(n-1) - (gpf(n-2) + gpf(n-1)) if a(n) >= 2 and has not previously appeared, otherwise a(n) = a(n-1) + (gpf(n-2) + gpf(n-1)), where gpf(k) = A006530(k) = greatest prime dividing k.
%C A352603 This sequence uses a similar rule to the Recaman sequence A005132 except that here the step size is set to be the sum of the greatest primes dividing the previous two terms.
%C A352603 In the first 100000 terms many small numbers do not appear, e.g., 5, 6, 7, 9. It is unknown if these eventually appear. In the same range numerous numbers appear multiple times, e.g., 47964 appears six times. The largest term in the range is a(98963) = 1529048.

%e A352603 a(3) = 8 as gpf(2) + gpf(3) = 2 + 3 = 5, so a(3) = a(2) + 5 = 8.
%e A352603 a(4) = 13 as gpf(3) + gpf(8) = 3 + 2 = 5, and as 8 - 5 = 3 has already appeared, a(4) = a(3) + 5 = 13.
%e A352603 a(7) = 38 as gpf(28) + gpf(48) = 7 + 3 = 10, and as 48 - 10 = 38 has not appeared, a(7) = 38.
