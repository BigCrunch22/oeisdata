%N A352533 Irregular table read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of regions formed after k diagonals, with k>=0, are drawn between vertices of a regular n-gon, with n>=3, when each vertex is fully connected to all other vertices in counterclockwise order before the next vertex, in counterclockwise order, is chosen.
%C A352533 To create the diagonals between the vertices of the regular n-gon a random starting vertex is first chosen. This vertex is then connected to all other vertices where those vertices are chosen in a counterclockwise direction around the n-gon from the starting vertex. Once all those diagonals are drawn the next neighboring vertex, in a counterclockwise direction from the starting vertex, is chosen. This vertex is then connected to all other vertices in the same way. This method is repeated until all vertices are connected by diagonals. The sequence gives the number of regions inside the n-gon after each such diagonal is drawn.
