%N A352883 Irregular table read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of regions formed after k diagonals, with k>=0, are drawn between vertices of a regular n-gon, with n>=3, when each vertex in turn is connected to the vertex floor(n/2) vertices to its left, then floor(n/2)-1 vertices to its left, then floor(n/2)-2 vertices ... until all vertices are connected by diagonals.
%C A352883 To create the diagonals between the vertices of the regular n-gon a random starting vertex is first chosen. This vertex is then connected to the vertex floor(n/2) vertices to its left. The left neighboring vertex of the starting vertex is then chosen and this is connected to the vertex floor(n/2) to its left. This process is continued until all vertices are connected by diagonals to the vertices floor(n/2) to their left. Note that when n is even only n/2 diagonals are drawn in this phase as further diagonals would just retrace the previous diagonal connections. The initial vertex is then chosen again and it is connected to the vertex floor(n/2)-1 to its left. Its left neighboring vertex is then connected to the vertex floor(n/2)-1 to its left, and so on. This process of connecting all vertices to those on their left by diagonals, where the step size decreases by one after each complete circuit of the n-gon until the step size is 2, is continued until all vertices are connected by diagonals. The sequence gives the number of regions inside the n-gon after each such diagonal is drawn.
