%N A352098 a(1) = 6, a(2) = 15; let i = a(n-2) and j = a(n-1); a(n) = least k not already in the sequence  such that gcd(j, k) = 1 and gcd(i, k) = m > 1 and both omega(i) and omega(k) exceed omega(m), where omega = A001221.
%C A352098 Variant of A098550 analogous to A337687 regarding its relationship to A064413.
%C A352098 Theorem: the sequence contains numbers in A024619. Proof: with m = gcd(i, k) > 1, we have omega(m) >= 1, however, both omega(i) and omega(k) must exceed omega(m). Therefore, if no number in the sequence has a single distinct prime factor, none can arise. This restricts the sequence to numbers that are not prime powers.
%C A352098 Theorem: i and k are nondivisors of one another. Proof: both omega(i) and omega(k) exceed omega(m), therefore there exists some prime p | i and some prime q | k, yet, p does not divide k and q does not divide i. Hence i does not divide k and k does not divide i.
%C A352098 The numbers i and k have the relationship described in A272619, a sort of relationship described in A045763.
%C A352098 Theorem: if prime p | j then p does not divide k. Consequence of coprimality axiom gcd(j, k) = 1. Hence, even terms are nonadjacent in the sequence. Therefore we begin this sequence with {6, 15}.
%C A352098 Composite quasi-rays in the Yellowstone sequence scatterplot are retained, bifurcated according to parity for same reasons as in that sequence.
%C A352098 Conjecture: permutation of A024619.
