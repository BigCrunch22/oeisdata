%N A352963 What remains from the sequence of positive integers (A000027) when all prime sums of two successive digits are erased.
%C A352963 After an erasure, we start reading again what is left, from the beginning, in order to spot the next pair of successive digits that will be erased. Those two digits can span a comma or a void.
