%N A352903 a(n) is the minimum number of steps required to construct a segment of length sqrt(n) in compass-and-straightedge construction.
%C A352903 Compass-and-straightedge construction allows the use of only a straightedge (without scale) and a collapsing compass. A "step" consists of constructing a line or constructing a circle with a point as its center. Constructing an intersection uses 0 steps.
%C A352903 Given two points in the plane, separated by a unit distance, a segment of length sqrt(n) cannot be constructed in fewer than a(n) steps.
%C A352903 Proving that "a(2021) is not more than 10" was the 2021 Chinese Mathematical Olympiad's Problem 5. According to Y. Ai et al., it is known that a(2021) is not more than 8 and not less than 7 because the maximum k such that a(k)=6 is 1024.
