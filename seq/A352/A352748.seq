%N A352748 Indices k of tribonacci numbers T(k) such that T(k+1) - (tribonacci constant)*T(k) is negative.
%C A352748 The tribonacci constant, which is approximately 1.839, is described in A058265. The tribonacci constant is the only real solution to the characteristic equation (x^3 = x^2+x+1) for the tribonacci sequence. It describes the asymptotic growth of the tribonacci sequence.
%C A352748 The sequence doesn't contain three consecutive numbers. Also, the difference between two consecutive numbers is never more than 3.
%e A352748 T(5) = 4 and T(6) = 7. Therefore, T(6) - (tribonacci constant)*T(5) equals approximately -0.356 < 0. Thus, index 5 is in this sequence.
