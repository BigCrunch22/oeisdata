%N A352668 Maximum number of induced copies of the diamond graph K_{1,1,2} in an n-node graph.
%C A352668 The sequence (a(n)/binomial(n,4)) is decreasing for n >= 4 and converges to 72/125, the inducibility of the diamond graph (Hirst 2014).
%C A352668 It is known that there exists a complete multipartite optimal graph (i.e., an n-node graph with a(n) induced diamond graphs) for all n (Brown and Sidorenko 1994) and that a complete 5-partite graph is asymptotically optimal (Hirst 2014). For 3 <= n <= 7, the 3-partite Turán graph is optimal, and for 7 <= n <= 45, the 4-partite Turán graph is optimal. (For n = 7 both are optimal.) It appears that the 5-partite Turán graph is optimal for all n >= 46 (verified up to n = 75).
