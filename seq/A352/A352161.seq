%N A352161 Numbers m such that the smallest digit in the decimal expansion of 1/m is k = 8, ignoring leading and trailing 0's.
%C A352161 Leading 0's are not considered, otherwise every integer >= 11 would be a term.
%C A352161 Trailing 0's are also not considered, otherwise numbers of the form 2^i*5^j with i, j >= 0, apart from 1 (A003592) would be terms.
%C A352161 If t is a term, 10*t is also a term; so, terms with no trailing zeros are all primitive terms: 125, 1125, ...
%C A352161 Note that for k = 7, if any term exists, it must be greater than 10^10. - _Jinyuan Wang_, Mar 29 2022

%F A352161 A352153(a(n)) = 8.
%e A352161 m = 125 is a term since 1/125 = 0.008 and the smallest digit after the leading 0's is 8.
%e A352161 m = 1125 is a term since 1/1125 = 0.00088888888... and the smallest digit after the leading 0's is 8.
%Y A352161 Cf. A351474.
%Y A352161 Similar with smallest digit k: A352154 (k=0), A352155 (k=1), A352156 (k=2), A352157 (k=3), A352158 (k=4), A352159 (k=5), A352160 (k=6), A352153 (no known term for k=7), this sequence (k=8), no term (k=9).
