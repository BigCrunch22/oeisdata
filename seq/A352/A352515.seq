%N A352515 Number of weak nonexcedances (parts on or below the diagonal) of the n-th composition in standard order.
%C A352515 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions. See also A000120, A059893, A070939, A114994, A225620.

%e A352515 The 89th composition in standard order is (2,1,3,1), with weak nonexcedances {2,3,4}, so a(89) = 3.
