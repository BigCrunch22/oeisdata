%N A352613 Multiplicative, with a(p^k) determined using the same rule as Van Eck's sequence for any prime p and k > 0.
%C A352613 If a(m) = a(p^k-1) for some m < p^k-1, take the largest such m and set a(p^k) = p^k-1-m; otherwise a(p^k) = 0.
%e A352613 a(1) = 1 (as this sequence is multiplicative).
%e A352613 a(2) = 0 as there is no m < 1 such that a(m) = a(1) (by Van Eck's rule).
%e A352613 a(3) = 0 as there is no m < 2 such that a(m) = a(2) (by Van Eck's rule).
%e A352613 a(4) = 3-2 = 1 as a(2) = a(3) (by Van Eck's rule).
%e A352613 a(5) = 4-1 = 3 as a(1) = a(4) (by Van Eck's rule).
%e A352613 a(6) = a(2)*a(3) = 0 (as this sequence is multiplicative).
