%N A352622 Number of regular convex polytopes that can be formed with n indistinguishable points located at the vertices, coinciding in equal frequency at each vertex, if coinciding at all.
%C A352622 For n = 1: there is only a 0-dimensional simplex.
%C A352622 For n = 2: the two points may coincide or may form a 1-dimensional simplex.
%C A352622 For n = 3: the three points may coincide or may form a 2-dimensional simplex.
%C A352622 For n = 2^(k+1), where k is a positive integer: a(n) = k + (k+2) + (k-1) + (k-1) = 4*k: k polygons (one for each factor > 2), k+2 simplexes (one for each factor), k-1 cubes (one for each even factor > 4, the cubes for 2 and 4 are a simplex and polygon, respectively), and k-1 orthoplexes (one for each even factor > 4, orthoplexes with 1, 2, and 4 vertices are already counted).
%C A352622 For prime numbers greater than 3 (n = p > 3, where p is prime): a(n) is always 3:
%C A352622 (1) the 0-dimensional polytope (all points coinciding), (2) a 2-dimensional p-gon, where p is a prime n, and (3) a (p-1)-dimensional simplex.
%C A352622 For even numbers which are not powers of 2: a(n) = 2*(number of factors) + (number of even factors) - 3 + adjustments. The adjustments are as follows: -1 if n is a multiple of 3; -1 if n is a multiple of 4; +1 for each positive integer k such that 2^(k+2) is a factor of n; +1 for each factor of n which is in the set (12,20,24,120,600). With the exception of factors 1 and 2, every factor contributes a simplex and a polygon. Even factors add a third polytope which is an orthoplex. Factors 1 and 2 only add a zero-dimensional and one-dimensional simplex respectively and so a total of three is subtracted (-1 for each of factors 1 + 2 and -1 for the even factor 2). The polygon and the simplex to which the factor of 3 maps are identical leading to an adjustment of -1. The polygon and the 2-dimensional "cube" that a factor of 4 maps to are identical also leading to a -1 adjustment. Factors which are powers of 2 greater than 4 and factors which correspond to a polytope peculiar to 3 or 4 dimensions each add one more possible polytope.
%C A352622 For nonprime odd numbers which are multiples of 3: a(n) = 2*(the number of factors) - 2. Each factor maps to a polygon and a simplex, but for the factor 3 the polygon is the simplex, and the factor 1 maps to a single coincident point.
%C A352622 For nonprime odd numbers which are not multiples of 3: a(n) = 2*(the number of factors) - 1. Each factor > 1 maps to a polygon and a simplex and the factor 1 maps to a single coincident point.
