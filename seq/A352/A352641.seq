%N A352641 For any n > 0, let E_n be the variant of Van Eck's sequence where values are taken mod n; if E_n is eventually periodic, then a(n) is the length of its transient part; otherwise a(n) = -1.
%C A352641 For any n > 0: E_n(1) = 0, and for any k > 0, if E_n(m) = E_n(k) for some m < k, take the largest such m and set E_n(k+1) = (k-m) mod n; otherwise E_n(k+1) = 0.
%C A352641 Note that in general, E_n(k) <> A181391(k) mod n.
%C A352641 For n <= 10000:
%C A352641 - E_n is always eventually periodic,
%C A352641 - except for n = 1, 3 and 4, E_n is eventually constant (with value 1).
%C A352641 Is E_n eventually periodic for all n?

%e A352641 For n = 3:
%e A352641 - E_3 is eventually 7-periodic:
%e A352641           0 0 1 0 2 0 (2 2 1 0 1 2 1)*
%e A352641 - the transient part has 6 terms,
%e A352641 - so a(3) = 6.
