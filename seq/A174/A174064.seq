%N A174064 Irregular triangle, row sums = n.
%C A174064 Column 1 = A174026.
%C A174064 The triangle begins 1, 2,...then all columns >1 are shifted down twice from previous column. Next term in column 1 = n - (sum of terms in n-th row, columns >1). Terms of the triangle for columns >1 are filled in as a product of column 1 * column 1.
