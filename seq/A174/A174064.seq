%N A174064 Irregular triangle, row sums = n; a generator for sequence A174026
%C A174064 Row sums = n; column 1 = A174026
%F A174064 The triangle begins 1, 2,...then all columns >1 are shifted down twice from
%F A174064 previous column. Next term in column 1 = n - (sum of terms in n-th row, columns
%F A174064 >1). Terms of the triangle for columns >1 are filled in as a product of
%F A174064 column 1 * column 1.
%e A174064 Triangle heading, and first few rows of the triangle =
%e A174064 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, .4, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1,... = heading, * left column giving:

%e A174064 Example: Leftmost term in column 9 = 1 = (9 - (4 + 2 + 0 + 2)). Then the
%e A174064 "1" is entered into the top heading as a multiplier. Multiply, filling in
%e A174064 more terms, then obtain next term of left border as before.
