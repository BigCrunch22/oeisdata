%N A174106 Smallest primes such that when primes up to and including the n-th term in this sequence are summed, the result will be divisible by 10^n.
%C A174106 In the long term, the prime sums' residues modulo 10^n are uniformly distributed, so one would expect the n-th term to be about the same size as the n-th prime.
%e A174106 2+3+5 = 10, so 5 is the 1st term.
%e A174106 2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23 = 100, so 23 is the 2nd term.
