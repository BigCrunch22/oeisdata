%N A174665 Sequence whose indices are based on the Fibonacci sequence as explained in comments.
%C A174665 With the Fibonacci sequence A000045 without 0, i.e., here F(0)=1, F(1)=1, F(2)=2, F(3)=3, ..., this sequence satisfies: first condition: a(F(n+1)-1)=3*a(F(n)-1)-3 or a(F(n)-1)=(3^(n-2)+3)/2. second condition (recurrence): between a(F(n)-1) and a(F(n+1)-1), the first (F(n-1)-1) terms of the sequence are repeated. It seems that this sequence gives the numbers of 1 in the successive sets of 1 in the sequence A174664.
%e A174665 a(F(4)-1) = a(4) = 6. a(F(5)-1) = a(7) = 15. Between 42=a(12) and 123=a(20) we obtain the first F(5)-1=7 terms: 1, 2, 3, 1, 6, 1, 2.
