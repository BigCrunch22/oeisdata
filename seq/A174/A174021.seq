%N A174021 Number of symmetry classes of reduced 3x3 magilatin squares with magic sum n.
%C A174021 A magilatin square has equal row and column sums and no number repeated in any row or column. It is reduced if the least value in it is 0. The symmetries are row and column permutations and diagonal flip.
%C A174021 a(n) is given by a quasipolynomial of degree 4 and period 840.
