%N A174087 Number of circular permutations with no arithmetic progressions i, ..., i+r, ..., i+2r (mod n) of any equal spacings d.
%C A174087 Circular permutations are permutations whose indices are from the ring of integers modulo n. Here we count both the sequence 1,2,3 (r=1) as a progression in 1,2,3,0,4,5, (note d=1) and in 1,0,2,4,3,5 (here, d=2).
