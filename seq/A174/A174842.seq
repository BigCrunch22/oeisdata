%N A174842 Irregular triangle T(i,n) giving the number of elements of Zp having multiplicative order di, the i-th divisor of p-1, where p is the n-th prime.
%C A174842 The divisors of p-1 are assumed to be in increasing order. The first row, for prime 2, has only one term. All other rows begin with two 1s and end with phi(p-1). There are tau(p-1), the number of divisors of p-1, terms in each row. The sum of the terms in each row is p-1. When p is a prime of the form 4k-1, then the last two terms in the row are equal. When p is a prime of the form 4k+1, then the last two terms in the row have a ratio of 2.

%F A174842 T(i,n) = phi(di), where di is the i-th divisor of prime(n)-1.
%e A174842 For prime p=17, the 7th prime, the multiplicative order of the numbers 1 to p-1 is 1, 8, 16, 4, 16, 16, 16, 8, 8, 16, 16, 16, 4, 16, 8, 2. There is one 1, one 2, two 4's, four 8's, and eight 16's. Hence row 7 is 1, 1, 2, 4, 8.
