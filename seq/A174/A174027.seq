%N A174027 Alternating triangle (version 2) read by rows: composites k such that k=6*m-+1=r*j r>=j and n>=q>0 where r=6*n-1 or r=6*n+1 and j=6*q-1 or j=6*q+1.
%C A174027 Composites of form 6*m-1 are in even (0,2,4,..) rows of alternating triangle only. Composites of form 6*m+1 are in odd (1,3,5,..) rows of alternating triangle only. 1 UNION nontrivial primes UNION A174027(without repetition) = A140475 U A174027(without repetition) = A007310 = numbers of form 6*n+-1, where alternating triangle (version 1) is A173865.
