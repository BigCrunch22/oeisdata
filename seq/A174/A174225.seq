%N A174225 Array: row n consists of the positive integers x for which there are exactly n positive integers y such that x+y divides x*y.
%C A174225 Many properties of the array follow easily from Comments at A063647:
%C A174225 1. Every positive integer except 1 occurs, exactly once.
%C A174225 2. Row 1 consists of the primes.
%C A174225 3. Row k includes p^k for all primes p, for k>=1.
%C A174225 4. Row 4 includes all products of two distinct primes.
%C A174225 5. Column 1 consists of even numbers.
%e A174225 Corner of the array:
%e A174225 2....3....5....7....11....13....
%e A174225 4....9....25...49...121...169...
%e A174225 8....27...125..343..1331..2197..
%e A174225 6....10...14...15...16....21....
%e A174225 6 is in row 4 because there are 4 numbers y for which
%e A174225 6+y divides 6*y; they are 3,6,12,30.
%Y A174225 Cf. A063647.
%K A174225 nonn,tabl
