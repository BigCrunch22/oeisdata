%N A174026 Convolved with its aerated variant = (1, 2, 3, ...).
%C A174026 Equals left border of triangle A174064.
%C A174026 With suitable polcoeff offsets, we obtain: (x * 2x^2 + x^3 + 2x^5) * (1 + 2x^2 + 4x^4 + 2x^8 + 4x^10 + ...) = (x + 2x^2 + 3x^3 + 4x^4 + 5x^5 + ...).
%F A174026 Left border of a multiplication table with columns >1 shifted down twice, with row sums = (1, 2, 3, ...); as shown in triangle A174064.
%e A174026 First few rows of triangle A174064 = 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 4, ... = heading terms, multiplied * left border.

%e A174026 where each successive column > 1 is shifted down twice, with terms filled in as a product of (1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 4, 2, ...) * (1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 4, 2, ...).
%e A174026 The next term in the series is generated in the ongoing left column, such that leftmost term = (n - sum of row n terms in columns > 1).
%e A174026 For example, a(9) = 1 since the terms to the right of the 1 in row 9 are (4, 2, 0, 2), sum = 8.
