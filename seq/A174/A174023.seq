%N A174023 The number of primes between prime(n)# and prime(n)# + prime(n)^2.
%C A174023 Here prime(n)# denotes the product of the first n primes, A002110(n). This sequence provides numerical evidence that the smallest prime p greater than prime(n)#+1 is a prime distance from prime(n)#; that is, p-prime(n)# is a prime number, as shown in the sequence of Fortunate numbers, A005235. For p-prime(n)# to be a composite number, p would have to be greater than prime(n)#+prime(n)^2, which would imply that a(n)=0.

%F A174023 Limit_{N->infinity} (Sum_{n=1..N} a(n)) / (Sum_{n=1..N} prime(n)) = 1. - _Alain Rocchelli_, Nov 03 2022
%e A174023 For 3, the second prime, 3# is 6 and 3#+3^2 is 15. There are 3 primes between 6 and 15: 7, 11, and 13. Hence a(2)=3.
