%N A174457 Infinitely refactorable numbers: numbers k such that each iteration under the map x -> A000005(x) produces a divisor of k.
%C A174457 In other words, let d^1(n) = A000005(n) and, for all positive integers k, let d^(k+1)(n) = A000005(d^k(n)). Sequence lists numbers n with the property that every such value of d^k(n) divides n.
%C A174457 A141586 is a subsequence. Is A110821 a subsequence?
%C A174457 Not a subsequence of A141551: 504 is the smallest term in this sequence not member of A141551.
%C A174457 a(n) is even for all n, since for any n >= 2, d^k(n) = 2 for some k. Proof: {d^k(n)} is a nonincreasing sequence of k, so it must stablize at a fixed point of the map x -> A000005(x), namely x = 1 or 2. But d^k(n) = 1 for some k implies that n = 1. - _Jianing Song_, Apr 20 2022

%e A174457 9 has 3 divisors, and 9 is a multiple of 3. But 3 has 2 divisors, and 9 is not a multiple of 2. Hence, 9 does not belong to this sequence.
%e A174457 36 has 9 divisors, 9 has 3 divisors, 3 has 2 divisors, and 9, 3, and 2 are all divisors of 36. (Since 2 has 2 divisors, all further steps produce a value of 2.) Hence, 36 belongs to this sequence.
