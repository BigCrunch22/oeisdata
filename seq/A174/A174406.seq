%N A174406 a(n) = smallest number u such that almost every number is the sum of at most u n-th powers of positive numbers.
%C A174406 A variant of Waring's problem.
%C A174406 "Almost all" means that the exceptions have zero density.
%C A174406 Only three other values of the sequence are known: a(8) = 32, a(16) = 64, and a(32) = 128. The cited survey by Vaughan and Wooley shows that G_1(8) = 32, G_1(16) = 64, and G_1(32) = 128.  The quantity G_1(5) has not been evaluated, nor have G_1(6) and G_1(7). - _David Covert_, Jun 29 2016
