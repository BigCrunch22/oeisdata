%N A025488 Number of distinct prime signatures of the positive integers up to 2^n.
%C A025488 The distinct prime signatures, in the order in which they occur, are listed in A124832. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 16 2019
%C A025488 The subsequence a(n) = A085089(2^n) is strictly increasing since it counts at least the additional prime signature (n) which did not occur for the previously considered numbers. All other partitions of n are prime signatures of numbers larger than 2^n and therefore counted only as part of later terms. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 17 2019

%e A025488 From _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 16 2019: (Start)
%e A025488 For n = 0, the only integer k to be considered is 1, so the only prime signature is the empty one, (), whence a(0) = 1.
%e A025488 For n = 1, the integers k to be considered are {1, 2}; the prime signatures are {(), (1)}, whence a(1) = 2.
%e A025488 For n = 2, the integers k to be considered are {1, 2, 3, 4}; the distinct prime signatures are {(), (1), (2)}, whence a(2) = 3.
%e A025488 For n = 3, the integers k to be considered are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}; the distinct prime signatures are {(), (1), (2), (1,1), (3)}, whence a(3) = 5. (End)
