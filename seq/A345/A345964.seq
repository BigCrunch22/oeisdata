%N A345964 At digit-position a(n) in the sequence starts the sum a(n) + 1. This is the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms with this property. See the Comments section for more explanations.
%C A345964 A "digit-position" (DP in short) is the rank of a digit in the succession of the digits of the sequence. At DP#1 we find the digit "2" here. At DP#9 we find "1" (the 1 of 100), etc.
%C A345964 A term > 9 uses more than one digit when 1 is added to it (9 + 1 = 10 uses two digits for instance; 99 + 1 = 100 uses three digits, etc.) The convention here says that the sum a(n) + 1 is visible in the sequence at DP#a(n). This means that the said sum will use sometimes contiguous digits that belong to an existing term [example: a(11) = 15 and 15 + 1 (= 16) is visible in a(12) = 160 at DP#15 and DP#16], or will use successive digits belonging to two (or more) contiguous terms [example: a(23) = 44 and 44 + 1 (= 45) is visible in (44, 50) at DP#44 and DP#45 (we don't take into account commas and spaces, only digits)].
