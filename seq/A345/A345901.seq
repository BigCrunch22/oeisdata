%N A345901 a(n) is the largest k such that the tribonacci word A080843 contains a block of length k*n that is an abelian k-th power.
%C A345901 An abelian k-th power consists of k blocks x_1 x_2 ... x_k such that each x_i is a permutation of x_1. For example, the English word "deeded" is an abelian 3rd power.
%e A345901 For n=4, A080843 contains the block 2010.0102.0102, which is an abelian 3rd power. But no blocks of size 16 in A080843 are abelian 4th powers.
%Y A345901 Cf. A080843.
