%N A345117 a(n) is the index (in Z/nZ) of the first already visited element in the process of moving around Z/nZ, starting at 0 with stride 1 and increasing stride by 1 after each step.

%e A345117 For n = 3 we start with Z/3Z represented as [0,1,2]. In the first step we mark the zero to obtain [0*,1,2] and move one step (to 1). Then we mark the 1 to obtain [0*,1*,2] and move two steps (to 0*). We have landed on a number already visited, so the process ends here, and as we have landed on 0 last, a(3) = 0.
%e A345117 For n = 4 we start with [0,1,2,3]. After the first step we get [0*,1,2,3] and we land at 1. After the second step we have [0*,1*,2,3] and we have landed at 3. In the penultimate step we mark the 3 to get [0*,1*,2,3*] and move 3 steps (to 2). We mark the 2 and move 4 steps to the 2*, which we have already visited. Therefore, a(4) = 2.
%e A345117 For n = 5 the list of steps is as follows: [0,1,2,3,4] -> [0*,1,2,3,4] -> [0*,1*,2,3,4] -> [0*,1*,2,3*,4] -> we land on 1 again, therefore a(5) = 1.
%e A345117 For n = 7 the list of steps is as follows: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6] -> [0*,1,2,3,4,5,6] -> [0*,1*,2,3,4,5,6] -> [0*,1*,2,3*,4,5,6] -> [0*,1*,2,3*,4,5,6*] -> we land on 3 again, therefore a(7) = 3.
%e A345117 Note: the '*' after a number means that this number was already visited.
