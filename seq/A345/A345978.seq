%N A345978 Third coordinate of the points of a counterclockwise spiral on an hexagonal grid in a symmetric redundant hexagonal coordinate system.
%C A345978 This is a negated version of A307013 with the advantage of symmetry, i.e., A307011(n) + A307012(n) + a(n) = 0. The mutual angles of the 3 coordinate axes then are 120 or 240 degrees.
%C A345978 From _Peter Munn_, Jul 18 2021: (Start)
%C A345978 The coordinate system can be described using 3 axes that pass through spiral point 0 and one of points 1, 2 or 3. Along each axis, one of the coordinates is 0. a(n) is the signed distance from spiral point n to the axis that passes through point 3. The distance is measured along either of the lines through point n that are parallel to one of the other 2 axes and the sign is such that point 1 has negative distance.
%C A345978 The coordinates may be used in 2 ways. Firstly, any 2 of the 3 coordinates can be paired as oblique coordinates, which entails mapping each coordinate to a vector that is parallel to the line along which the other coordinate is 0 (described further in A307012). Alternatively, each of the 3 coordinates is mapped to a vector perpendicular to the line along which the coordinate is 0, then the sum of the vectors is divided by the square root of 3.
%C A345978 This coordinate system has been used for more than half a century. See the extract from Moffatt, Pearsall and Wulff included in the linked Princeton MAE page (which refers to a 4th coordinate, making it a 3D system). "Cube coordinates" appears to be a currently popular term for the system in some information technology communities. This refers to the useful isometric view of the cubic cells from a 3 dimensional lattice that are indexed by 3 coordinates that sum to zero.
