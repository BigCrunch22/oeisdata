%N A345912 Numbers k such that the k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) has reverse-alternating sum -1.
%C A345912 The reverse-alternating sum of a sequence (y_1,...,y_k) is Sum_i (-1)^(k-i) y_i.
%C A345912 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
