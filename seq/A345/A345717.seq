%N A345717 Orders of abelian cubes in the tribonacci word A080843.
%C A345717 An abelian cube is a word of the form x x' x'', where x' and x'' are permutations of x, like the English word "deeded".  The order of an abelian cube is the length of x.
%H A345717 Pierre Popoli, Jeffrey Shallit, and Manon Stipulanti, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02409">Additive word complexity and Walnut</a>, arXiv:2410.02409 [math.CO], 2024. See p. 17.
%F A345717 There is a deterministic finite automaton of 1169 states that takes n in its tribonacci representation as input and accepts if and only if there is an abelian cube of order n.  It can be obtained with the Walnut theorem-prover.
%e A345717 Here are the earliest-appearing abelian cubes of the first few orders:
%e A345717 n = 4:  2010.0102.0102
%e A345717 n = 6: 102010.010201.010201
%e A345717 n = 7: 0102010.0102010.1020100
%e A345717 n = 11: 02010010201.01020100102.01020100102
