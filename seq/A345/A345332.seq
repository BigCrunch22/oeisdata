%N A345332 a(n) is the number of consecutive even prime gap pairs (g1, g2) satisfying g1 == 0 (mod 6) and g2 == 0 (mod 6) out of the first 2^n consecutive even prime gap pairs.
%C A345332 It seems that the fraction of prime gap pairs (g1, g2) for which g1 == 0 (mod 6), satisfying g2 == 0 (mod 6) as well, i.e., a(n)/A340948(n), tends to a constant, say c, when the number of prime gap pairs tends to infinity. From n = 27 we obtain that c > 0.431, while it can be argued heuristically that c < 0.5.
%C A345332 Meanwhile, the fractions of prime gap pairs (g1, g2), satisfying either g2 == 2 (mod 6) or g2 == 4 (mod 6), seem to tend both to another constant, (1-c)/2, when the number of prime gap pairs tends to infinity (see A345333 and A345334).
%F A345332 a(n) = A340948(n) - (A345333(n) + A345334(n)).
