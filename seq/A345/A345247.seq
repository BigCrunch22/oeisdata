%N A345247 Number of unlabeled graphs of odd girth at least 7 with n vertices.
%C A345247 The odd girth of a graph is the length of a shortest cycle of odd length. Thus, these are the graphs (not necessarily connected) that do not have a triangle or C_5 as a subgraph. The bipartite graphs (which have no odd cycles) are included.
%Y A345247 EULER transform of A165452.
