%N A345251 Numbers engraved on the 12 sides of an ancient dodecahedral rock crystal from the first century A.D.
%C A345251 The rock crystal is held at the Archeological Museum Patras in Greece, Inv. 1280.
%C A345251 The stone is a grave object of a richly buried boy from Patras, Greece. Maybe it was a token. What is unusual, however, is the sequence of numbers, which in other Dodecad finds is mostly the series of integers from 1 to 12. The care with which the numbers were engraved is also unusual. Maybe there is an arithmetic game or arithmetic puzzle behind it.
