%N A345011 Lexicographically earliest sequence of nonnegative terms forming a clockwise square spiral when nothing else is read except the nonprime/prime nature of the terms (see the Comments section).
%C A345011 A nonprime term turns the pencil 0 degrees to the right, then advances 1 unit; a prime term turns the pencil 90 degrees to the right, then advances 1 unit.
%e A345011 The pencil points towards the East before the start. The 0 doesn't change its orientation and a 1-unit line directed towards the East is traced. As 2 is prime, the pencil turns 90 degrees towards the South and a 1-unit line is traced. As 3 is prime, the pencil turns 90 degrees towards the West and a 1-unit line is traced. As 1 is nonprime, the pencil doesn't change its orientation (towards the West) and a 1-unit line is traced. As 5 is prime, the pencil turns 90 degrees towards the North and a 1-unit line is traced. As 4 is nonprime, the pencil doesn't change its orientation (towards the North) and a 1-unit line is traced. Etc.
%Y A345011 Cf. A345012 (same idea with nonprime/prime digits), A344547 (same idea with even/odd terms), A174344 (an example of a clockwise square spiral).
