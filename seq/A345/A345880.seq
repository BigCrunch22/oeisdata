%C A345880 If we now take the 5th letter of the above English sequence (T), the 23rd (W) and the 22003rd (O) we spell T.W.O. and 2 is the first term of A000040 (the prime numbers). We then take again the 5th letter of the sequence (T), the 53rd (H), the 13th (R), the 7th (E) and the 37th (E) to form T.H.R.E.E. and 3 is the next term of A000040. The letters in position 83, 15013, 3 and 7 will spell F.I.V.E. and 5 is the next term of A000040. Etc.
%C A345880 We are allowed to use the same letter many times (like the 7th one, E, for instance) to form a new name. The sequence A345713 forbids such repetitions.
