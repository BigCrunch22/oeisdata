%N A345333 a(n) is the number of consecutive even prime gap pairs (g1, g2) satisfying g1 == 0 (mod 6) and g2 == 2 (mod 6) out of the first 2^n consecutive even prime gap pairs.
%C A345333 It seems that the fraction of prime gap pairs (g1, g2) for which g1 == 0 (mod 6), satisfying g2 == 2 (mod 6), i.e., a(n)/A340948(n), tends to a constant, say c, when the number of prime gaps tends to infinity. From n = 27 we obtain that c < 0.284, while it can be argued heuristically that c > 0.25.
%C A345333 Futhermore, it is believed that a(n) - A345334(n) will change sign infinitely often.
%F A345333 a(n) = A340948(n) - (A345332(n) + A345334(n)).
