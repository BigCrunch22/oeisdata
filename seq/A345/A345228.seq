%N A345228 Square array T(m,n), read by ascending antidiagonals. Let f(k) = k/2 if k is even, otherwise ((2*n+1)*k+2*T(m,n)+1)/2, T(m,n) is the smallest integer greater than -1, where m = f^j(m) for j > 0 exists. f^j(m) means the j-th iterate of f(m).
%C A345228 This sequence is an extension of A344583 ( row T(m,1) ).
%C A345228 If any row starts with T(1,n) > 0 then all further values in this row are >= T(1,n). This is because all trajectories of f(m) would diverge into infinity for smaller values. If n > T(1,n) > 0 then all numbers k, n <= k < n + T(1,n) are not inside this row.
%C A345228 The reason for the pattern in the row T(1,n) is that a cycle is only possible if we eventually reach a power of 2 under iteration. If we look at the case 9x+1 ( Row 4 ) as an example, we can understand this by the binary representation of 9: 1001. If we multiply any number j by 9 it equals a sum of j and a left-shifted version of j. Example j = 5: 1001*101 = 1001 + 100100 = 101101. In the Collatz operation 9x+1, an interrupted sequence of ones starting at the least significant bit is required to get an uninterrupted sequence of zeros by addition of 1. But in the case 9x+1 starting with x = 1 it is not possible to reach any 2^t-1 (pattern of all ones) because of the large gap of zeros in the binary representation of 9 (1001). By each multiplication, we add a shifted copy of 1001... at the left to the bit pattern and thus add gaps that are only slowly filled up with ones by the addition of the constant. To prevent an escape into infinity, in the Collatz process either the factor needs to have a gap of zeros smaller than two zeros in sequence (compare 9 -> row 4 and 15 -> row 7 ), or the constant we are adding in this process needs to be big enough to fill this gap quickly, e.g., 9x+7.
%C A345228 A surprising mystery are the many equal elements and correlations between different rows. For many values of m, we may observe T(m,n) = T(m,n+k) for some n and k, even if 1+2*n and 1+2*(n+k) are relatively prime.
%C A345228 A343858 identifies each cycle by the smallest number it may reach. This information can be used to check if two entries with the same value in T(m,n) correspond to the same cycle.
%C A345228 We find with growing n more similarity between T(m,n) and A025480(m-1), the related sequence A343858(m,n) has in the same fashion similarity to A000265(m).
%C A345228 A173732 is the compressed representation of the dynamics of row n = 1 (3x+1). But also A025480(3*n+1) = A173732(n) and we see now A025480 connected to generalizations of the Collatz function. This suggests a special role for the original 3x+1 version in this set of functions.
%C A345228 Possible consequences for Collatz conjecture:
%C A345228 If a yet unknown cycle for 3x+1 exists, a yet unknown cycle n = A173732^j(n) exists too. For all numbers reached in this cycle A173732 must have different values. But for all numbers reached in a yet unknown 3x+1 cycle T(m,1) must be zero by definition of this sequence. This would contradict (T(3*m,1)-1)/T(m,1) = 3 if we require T(m*3-1,1) = A173732(1+m). Of course we know T(m*3-1,1) = A173732(1+m) is not generally true, but we see an influence between T(m*3-1,n) and A173732(1+m) in this sequence.

%F A345228 (T((1+2*n)*m,n)-n)/T(m,n) = 1+2*n if T(m,n) > 0.
%F A345228 (T((1+2*(n-b))*m,n)-(n-b))/T(m,n) = 1+2*(n-b) if T(m,n) > 0. 0 <= b <= n. This formula is only true at such n where this is not in conflict with smaller values of b or the case b = 0. These formulas define the values of this sequence in a kind of hierarchy. For b > 0 it is an observation and the author does not yet have a valid theory for this.
%F A345228 T(m,n) >= T(1,n) if m > 0.

%e A345228 We may see this sequence as a sequence of functions:
%e A345228 in m=1: 0 -> f_n1_0(k) =  k/2; (3*k+1)/2.
%e A345228         1 -> f_n1_1(k) =  k/2; (3*k+3)/2.
%e A345228         2 -> f_n1_2(k) =  k/2; (3*k+5)/2.
%e A345228 in m=2: 0 -> f_n2_0(k) =  k/2; (5*k+1)/2.
%e A345228         1 -> f_n2_1(k) =  k/2; (5*k+3)/2.
%e A345228         2 -> f_n2_2(k) =  k/2; (5*k+5)/2.
%e A345228 T(1,4) = 3 because: f_n4_3(1) = (9+7)/2 = 16, f_n4_3(18) = 16/2 = 8, f_n4_3(8) = 8/2 = 4, f_n4_3(4) = 4/2 = 2, f_n4_3(2) = 2/2 = 1.
%e A345228 This shows that f_n4_3(f_n4_3(f_n4_3(f_n4_3(f_n4_3(1))))) = 1.
%e A345228 T(1,4) is not < 2 because no such loop which includes 1 exists for f_n4_0, f_n4_1 and f_n4_2.
