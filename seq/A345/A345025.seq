%N A345025 Number of regions formed when every pair of vertices of a regular n-gon are joined by an infinite line.
%C A345025 The count of regions includes both the closed bounded polygons and the open unbounded areas surrounding these polygons with two edges that go to infinity.
%C A345025 See A344857 for further examples and images of the regions.
%H A345025 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A345025/a345025.gif">Image for n = 3</a>. In this and other images the n-gon vertices are highlighted as white dots while the outer open regions are cross-hatched. The key for the edge-number coloring is shown at the top-left of the image. Note the edge count for open areas also includes the two infinite edges.

%F A345025 Formula for odd n: a(n) = (n^4 - 7*n^3 + 27*n^2 - 29*n + 8)/8 (see A344857).
%F A345025 For n >= 3, a(n) = A344857(n) +  A002378(n-1).
%e A345025 a(2) = 2 as an infinite line connecting two points cuts space into two unbounded regions.
%e A345025 a(3) = 7 as the three connected points of the 3-gon form one closed triangle along with six outer unbounded areas, seven regions in total.
%e A345025 a(4) = 16 as the four connected points of the 4-gon form four closed triangle inside the square along with twelve outer unbounded areas, sixteen regions in total.
