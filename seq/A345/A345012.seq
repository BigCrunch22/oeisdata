%N A345012 Lexicographically earliest sequence of nonnegative terms forming a clockwise square spiral when nothing else is read except the nonprime/prime nature of the digits (see the Comments section).
%C A345012 A nonprime digit turns the pencil 0 degrees to the right, then advances 1 unit; a prime digit turns the pencil 90 degrees to the right, then advances 1 unit.
%e A345012 The pencil points towards the East before the start. The 0 doesn't change its orientation and a 1-unit line directed towards the East is traced. As 2 is prime, the pencil turns 90 degrees towards the South and a 1-unit line is traced. As 3 is prime, the pencil turns 90 degrees towards the West and a 1-unit line is traced. As 1 is nonprime, the pencil doesn't change its orientation (towards the West) and a 1-unit line is traced. As 5 is prime, the pencil turns 90 degrees towards the North and a 1-unit line is traced. As 4 is nonprime, the pencil doesn't change its orientation (towards the North) and a 1-unit line is traced. Etc.
%e A345012 When it comes to a(10) = 20, the pencil reads 2 (prime), turns to the right and advances 1 square, then reads 0 (nonprime), doesn't change its orientation and advances 1 square again. Etc.
%Y A345012 Cf. A345011 (same idea with nonprime/prime terms), A344548 (same idea with even/odd digits), A174344 (an example of a clockwise square spiral).
