%N A345318 Median absolute deviation of {2*k^2 | k=1..n}.
%C A345318 The factor 2 in 2*k^2 in the definition is to ensure that median and median absolute deviation are always integers.
%C A345318 Conjecture: a(n) ~ (sqrt(3)/4) * n^2.
%C A345318 The conjecture is true. See links. - _Sela Fried_, Jul 17 2024.

%e A345318 For n = 5 the sample is {2*k^2 | k=1..5} = {2, 8, 18, 32, 50}, its median is 18, the absolute deviations from the median are {16, 10, 0, 14, 32}, the median of the absolute deviations is 14, so a(5) = 14.
%e A345318 For n = 6 the sample is {2*k^2 | k=1..6} = {2, 8, 18, 32, 50, 72}, its median is (18+32)/2 = 25, the absolute deviations from the median are {23, 17, 7, 7, 25, 47}, the median of the absolute deviations is (17+23)/2 = 20, so a(6) = 20.
