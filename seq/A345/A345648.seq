%N A345648 Number of polygons formed outside an n X n square when connecting all 4n points on the perimeter of the square by infinite lines.
%C A345648 For n = 0 to n = 11 the number of polygons formed outside the n x n square is less than the number formed inside the square. This changes for n >= 12 when the number formed outside becomes greater. The ratio of the number of polygons outside to the number inside for n = 26 is about 1.07 . If this ratio is unbounded or approaches some finite value as n -> infinity is not known.
%C A345648 See A345459 for images of the polygons.
%F A345648 a(n) = A345459(n) - A255011(n).
%Y A345648 Cf. A345459 (number inside and outside with square), A255011 (number inside the square), A344993, A344857, A092098, A007678.
