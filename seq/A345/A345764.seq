%N A345764 Number the tiles of a regular hexagonal tiling from 0 in a spiral. Consider perpendicular axes, X and Y, through the center of tile 0, one of which passes through the center of tile 1. Define a set of equivalence classes of tiles with respect to reflections about X and Y. a(n) is the smallest number of a tile in the same equivalence class as tile n.
%C A345764 The sense of the spiral (clockwise/counterclockwise) and its orientation are not significant, but for the purpose of illustration, we depict a counterclockwise spiral with its first step towards the right side of the page.
%C A345764 Equivalence classes contain a maximum of 4 tiles. This happens when tile m's reflection about axis X is a different tile, m_x, and these 2 tiles' reflections about axis Y are 2 further tiles, m_y and m_xy, to give an equivalence class {m, m_x, m_y, m_xy}. Some equivalence classes are smaller, because a tile is its own reflection about an axis, X or Y, that passes through the center of the tile.
%C A345764 The Wichmann reference describes bijections from certain unique factorization domains to the hexagonal tiling. Align the spiral with the mapping so that domain identities 0 and 1 map to tiles 0 and 1 respectively. If two integers from one of the domains map to tiles in the same equivalence class, then they share the same status as units, primes or composites.

%e A345764 Recall that the underlying tile numbers count steps along the spiral from 0. When we follow the spiral in the illustration above and encounter a number m, which denotes an equivalence class, for the first time, this is also at tile number m.
%e A345764 Tile 1 maps to itself (as does tile 4) when reflected about the axis through the centers of tiles 0 and 1 (horizontal as shown above). Tiles 1 and 4 map to each other when reflected about the perpendicular (vertical) axis. So tiles 1 and 4 form an equivalence class, and the smallest number of a tile in this class is 1. So a(1) = 1 and a(4) = 1.
