%N A345475 Nonsquares k whose continued fraction for the square root of k has a periodic part that is a nondecreasing sequence.
%C A345475 All k = m^2 + 1 (A002522) belong in the sequence because the periodic part of the continued fraction of sqrt(k) has a single element.
%e A345475 a(5)=7 because the periodic part of the continued fraction of sqrt(7) is (1,1,1,4) which is a nondecreasing sequence.
%e A345475 19 is not a term because the periodic part of the continued fraction of sqrt(19) is (2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 8) which is not a nondecreasing sequence.
