%N A345437 Represent the ring R = {x+y*sqrt(-2): x, y rational integers} by the cells centered at the points (x,y) of a square grid; number the cells of the grid along a counterclockwise square spiral, with the cells at (0,0) and (1,0) numbered 0, 1. Sequence lists the index numbers of the cells which are 0 or a prime in R.
%C A345437 R is the ring of integers in the quadratic number field Q(sqrt(-2)). The element x+y*sqrt(-2) in R has norm x^2+2*y^2.
%C A345437 A033715 gives the number of elements in R with norm n.
%C A345437 There are two units, +-1, of norm 1.
%C A345437 A341784 gives the norms of the primes in R, and A345438 gives the numbers of primes of those norms.
%D A345437 H. M. Stark, An Introduction to Number Theory. Markham, Chicago, 1970; Theorem 8.22 on page 295 lists the nine UFDs of the form Q(sqrt(-d)), cf. A003173.
