%N A345755 a(n) is the number of primes p satisfying n*(log_2(n))^2 < p <= (n+1)*(log_2(n+1))^2.
%C A345755 Prime gaps appear to grow more slowly than any power function.
%C A345755 Cramér's conjecture states that prime gaps grow as follows: prime(n+1) - prime(n) = O(log(prime(n))^2).
%C A345755 Since prime(n) ~ n*log(n), we conjecture that a(n) > 0 for n > 0, and that the exponent 2 cannot be replaced by any smaller exponent.
%C A345755 Note: n*(log_2(n))^2 < n^(log(127)/log(16)) when n >= 267. Therefore the conjecture immediately above is stronger than the conjecture that A143935(n) > 0 when n > 0, which in turn is stronger than Legendre's conjecture.
%C A345755 This sequence relies on intervals that are slightly more than twice as wide as those in the similar sequence A166363. A comment at that sequence by Greathouse discovers zero values (representing prime-free intervals). In contrast, the present sequence does not include zero entries for n <= 2772, suggesting that the lengths of prime gaps may be bracketed by the two sequences. We conjecture that prime gaps may be larger than log(p)^2, but are not larger than log_2(p)^2. - _Hal M. Switkay_, Aug 29 2023

%e A345755 a(10) is the number of primes > 110.35 and <= 131.64. a(10) = 3, because the primes in this interval are 113, 127, and 131.
