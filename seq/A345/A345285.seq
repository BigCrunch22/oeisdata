%N A345285 Sides of primary squares of type 1 (A344331). A primary square of type 1 is the smallest square that can be tiled with squares of two different sides a < b, so that the numbers of small and large squares are equal.
%C A345285 Notation: s = side of the primary tiled squares, a = side of small squares, b = side of large squares, and z = number of small squares = number of large squares.
%C A345285 Every term is of the form s = a*b * (a^2+b^2), with 1 <= a < b, and corresponding z = (a*b)^2 * (a^2+b^2) (A345286).
%C A345285 Every such primary square is composed of m = a*b * (a^2+b^2) elementary rectangles of length L = a^2+b^2 and width W = a*b, so with an area A = a*b * (a^2+b^2) = m.
%C A345285 If gcd(a, b) = 1, then primitive sides of square s = a*b * (a^2+b^2) are in A344333 that is a subsequence.
%C A345285 If a = 1 and b = n > 1, then sides of squares s = n * (n^2+1) form the subsequence A034262 \ {0, 1}.
%C A345285 If q is a term and integer r > 1, then q * r^4 is another term.
%C A345285 Every term is even.
