%N A345287 a(n) is the number of distinct possible tilings of type 1 for squares with side = A344331(n) and that can be tiled with squares of two different sizes so that the numbers of large or small squares are equal.
%C A345287 Every side of square of type 1 in A344331 is also the side of an elementary square of type 1. An elementary square of type 1 is the smallest square that can be tiled with squares of two different sides a < b and so that the numbers of small and large squares are equal.
%C A345287 Some notation: s = side of the tiled square, a = side of small squares, b = side of large squares, and z = number of small squares = number of large squares.
%C A345287 a(n) = 1 iff A344331(n) is a term of A344333 that is not a multiple of another term of A344333 (10, 68, 78, 222, ...).
%C A345287 The first side that is a multiple of two primitive sides is 30 = 3*10 = 1*30 (see 2nd example).

%F A345287 a(n) = Sum_{(k=1..n) & (A344333(k)|A344331(n))} tau(A344331(n)/A344333(k)).
%F A345287 a(n) = Sum_{(d | A344331(n)) & (d in A344333)} tau(A344331(n)/d) where tau is A000005. - _Michel Marcus_, Dec 22 2021
%e A345287 For a(1), A344331(1) = 10, then, with the formula, we get a(1) = tau(A344331(1)/A344333(1)) = tau(10/10) = tau(1) = 1. This unique corresponding tiling of this square 10 x 10 of type 1 with side s = 10 consists of z = 20 squares whose sides (a,b) = (1,2) (see below).

%e A345287 For a(3), A344331(3) = 30, then, with the formula, we get a(3) = tau(A344331(3)/A344333(1)) + tau(A344331(3)/A344333(2)) = tau(30/10) + tau(30/30) = tau(3) + tau(1) = 3. The 3 corresponding tilings of the square 30 x 30 of type 1 with side s = 30 consists of:
%e A345287 -> from 30 = 3*A344333(1) = 3*10, square with side s = 30 can be tiled with z = 180 squares with sides (a,b) = (1,2), indeed with 9 copies of primitive square 10 x 10, as above.
%e A345287 -> from 30 = 1*A344331(3) = 1*30, square with side s = 30 can be tiled with z = 20 squares with sides (a,b) = (3,6), indeed, it is the above square with scale 3.
%e A345287 -> from 30 = 1*A344331(3) = 1*30, square with side s = 30 can also be tiled with z = 90 squares with sides (a,b) = (1,3), indeed that is primitive square 30 x 30 with squares (a,b) = (1,3).
