%N A345676 Number of closed-loop self-avoiding paths on a 2-dimensional square lattice where each path consists of steps with successive lengths equal to the square numbers, from 1 to n^2.
%C A345676 This sequence gives the number of closed-loop self-avoiding walks on a 2D square lattice where the walk starts with a step length of 1 which then increments at each step to the next square number until the step length is n^2. No closed-loop path is possible until n = 15.
%C A345676 Like A334720 and A335305 the only n values that can form closed loop walks are those which correspond to the indices of even triangular numbers. Curiously though n = 16 walks form no closed loops, even though both n = 15 and n = 16 are indices of such numbers.
%C A345676 As in A010566 all possible paths are counted, including those that are equivalent via rotation and reflection.

%e A345676 a(1) to a(14) = 0 as no closed-loop paths are possible.
%e A345676 a(15) = 32 as there are four different paths which form closed loops, and each of these can be walked in eight different ways on a 2D square lattice. These walks consist of steps with lengths 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225. See the linked text images.
