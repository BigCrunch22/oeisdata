%N A345347 Find the largest k with F(k) <= n, where F(k) is the k-th Fibonacci number. a(n) = F(k+2) + n.
%C A345347 The terms consist of 1 together with numbers that appear in row m of the Wythoff array (A035513) if m is in the sequence.
%C A345347 a(0) = 1, otherwise a(n) is the number whose Zeckendorf representation is "10" followed by the Zeckendorf representation of n.
%C A345347 If we define an extended Zeckendorf representation to be the Zeckendorf representation with "01" appended, then the numbers in the sequence are exactly those whose extended representation starts 101... . This extended representation is a valid Fibonacci base representation if we specify the rightmost digit to have weight F(0) = 0.
%C A345347 Equivalently, for positive integer m, find the largest k with F(k) <= m, where F(k) is the k-th Fibonacci number. m is in the sequence if and only if m >= F(k) + F(k-2).
%C A345347 Numbers given to rabbits on Rabbit 1's branch of the generation tree described in the A035513 examples.
%C A345347 Equivalently, take the positive integers in turn, placing runs of them alternatively into 2 sets, with run lengths from A053602/A051792 (self-interleaved Fibonacci sequence) as follows:
%C A345347    set A: 1   0   1   1   2   3   5 ...
%C A345347    set B:   1   1   2   3   5   8 ...
%C A345347 The sequence lists the numbers in set A.

%F A345347 a(n) = A000045(A108852(n)+1) + n.
%F A345347 Union_{k >= 2} {m : F(k)+F(k-2) <= m < F(k+1)}, where F(k) = A000045(k).
%e A345347 The initial Fibonacci numbers are F(0)..F(5) = 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5.
%e A345347 For n = 0, the largest k with F(k) <= 0 is k = 0, so F(k+2) = F(2) = 1, so a(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
%e A345347 For n = 1, the largest k with F(k) <= 1 is k = 2, so F(k+2) = F(4) = 3, so a(1) = 3 + 1 = 4.
%e A345347 For n = 4, the largest k with F(k) <= 4 is k = 4, so F(k+2) = F(6) = 8, so a(4) = 8 + 4 = 12.
%e A345347 In the paragraph that follows we use the Wythoff array-based definition from the start of the comments.
%e A345347 Every positive integer appears once (only) in the Wythoff array. 0 is not positive, so does not appear in the array, so is not in the sequence. 1 is in the sequence by definition. 2 appears in Wythoff row 0, and 0 is not in the sequence, so 2 is not in the sequence. 4 appears in Wythoff row 1, and 1 is in the sequence, so 4 is in the sequence.
