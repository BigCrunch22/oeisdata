%N A251364 Difference between average of two consecutive odd primes and the sum of all prime factors of the average.
%C A251364 Sequence starts with the 2nd prime because the average of the first two primes is not an integer.
%H A251364 Conner L. Delahanty, <a href="/A251364/b251364.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..20000</a>
%F A251364 a(n) = ((prime(n+1) + prime(n+2))/2) - (sopfr((prime(n+1) + prime(n+2))/2)), where sopfr is A001414, the sum of primes dividing n (with repetition).
%e A251364 For n = 1, the average of prime(2) and prime(3) is 4. The prime factors of 4 are 2 and 2. 4 - (2 + 2) = 0.
%e A251364 For n = 2, the average of prime(3) and prime(4) is 6. The prime factors of 6 are 2 and 3. 6 - (2 + 3) = 1.
%e A251364 For n = 3, the average of prime(4) and prime(5) is 9. The prime factors of 9 are 3 and 3. 9 - (3 + 3) = 3.
%e A251364 For n = 4, the average of prime(5) and prime(6) is 12. The prime factors of 12 are 2, 2, and 3. 12 - (2 + 2 + 3) = 5.
