%N A251607 Number of non-congruent integer triangles ABC with largest side BC of length n whose opposite vertex A lies inside the closed boundary formed by BC and a locus of points whose real distance from B is x, from C is y and x^3+y^3=n^3.
%C A251607 Acute integer triangles ABC with largest side BC of length n (A247588) are segregated from obtuse or right integer triangles with the same largest side BC (A236384) by the closed boundary formed by a semicircle and BC as its diameter. The right integer triangles will lie on this boundary and the obtuse integer triangles within this boundary. Define a closed boundary S(q) that is formed by BC and a locus of points whose real distance from B is x, from C is y and x^q+y^q=n^q for integer q>0. Then S(2) is that closed boundary formed by a semicircle with BC as diameter. Euler proved that there are no integer triangles that lie on S(3) and Wiles for all S(q) where q>2. This sequence identifies all integer triangles with largest side BC of length n that lie inside S(3).
%e A251607 a(5)=3 as there are 3 non-congruent integer triangles with base length of 5 whose apex lies inside s(3). The integer triples are (3,3,5), (2,4,5), (3,4,5). The other triangles from the complete set of non-congruent integer triangles with largest side length 5 (A002620(5+1)) are (4,4,5), (1,5,5), (2,5,5 ), (3,5,5), (4,5,5), (5,5,5) and lie outside the closed boundary.
