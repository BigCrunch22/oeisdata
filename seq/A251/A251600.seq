%N A251600 Least k such that prime(k) + prime(k+1) contains n prime divisors (with multiplicity), otherwise 0.
%C A251600 If p and q are two consecutive odd primes, then p + q is the product of at least three primes (not necessarily distinct) because p + q = 2*(p + q)/2 => (p + q)/2 is a composite integer between two consecutive primes p and q that is the product of at least two prime numbers. Thus 2*(p + q)/2 has at least three prime factors => a(1) = 1 because prime(1) is even => prime(1) + prime(2) = 5 is prime and a(2) = 0, probably the only 0 of the sequence.
