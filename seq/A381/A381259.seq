%N A381259 Numbers obtained by concatenating powers of 2, sorted into increasing order.
%C A381259 Take the list {2^i: i >= 0} and concatenate its terms (allowing multiple copies) in any order; then sort the result into increasing order.
%e A381259 11 is a term because it is the concatenation of 1 = 2^0 with itself;
%e A381259 12 is a term because it is the concatenation of 1 = 2^0 with 2 = 2^1;
%e A381259 32 is a term because it is equal to 2^5;
%e A381259 168 is a term because it is the concatenation of 16 = 2^4 with 8 = 2^3.
%e A381259 0 is not a term because it is not a power of 2.
%Y A381259 Supersequence of A028846.
