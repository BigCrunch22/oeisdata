%N A381575 Number of disjoint-union partial algebras with zero on [n].
%C A381575 A disjoint-union partial algebra on a set S is a subset of the power set of S which is closed under union of disjoint sets.
%C A381575 A disjoint-union partial algebra with zero on a set S is a disjoint-union partial algebra on S which contains the empty set.
%C A381575 There are twice as many disjoint-union partial algebras on S as disjoint-union partial algebras with zero on S because the disjoint-union partial algebras without the empty set can be placed in bijection with those which have the empty set.
