%N A381226 a(n) = number of distinct positive integers that can be obtained by starting with n!, and optionally applying the operations square root, floor, and ceiling, in any order.
%e A381226 For n = 8, 8! = 40320; sqrt(40320) = 200.789..., floor and ceiling give 200 and 201. Sqrt(200) = 14.152..., and floor and ceiling give 14 and 15. From 14 we get 3 and 4; from 3 we get 1 and 2. 15 and 4 give nothing new. In all, we get a(8) = 9 different numbers: 40320, 200, 201, 14, 15, 3, 4, 1, 2.
%e A381226 Note that at each step, we must consider three "parents", if x was a term at the previous step, we get floor(sqrt(x)), sqrt(x), and ceiling(sqrt(x)) as potential parents at the next step. This did not concern us in the n=8 example, but if n is very large, all three of floor(sqrt(x)), sqrt(x), and ceiling(sqrt(x)) could produce distinct subtrees.
