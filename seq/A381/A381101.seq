%N A381101 Allouche-Johnson binary sequence based on the Narayana's cows sequence A000930.
%H A381101 J.-P. Allouche and T. Johnson, <a href="https://hal.science/hal-02986050v1">Narayana's cows and delayed morphisms</a>, in G. Assayag, M. Chemillier, and C. Eloy, Troisièmes Journées d'Informatique Musicale, JIM '96, Île de Tatihou, France, 1996, pp. 2-7.
%F A381101 The sequence can be generated by iterating a morphism starting with a:  a->ab, b->c, c->d, d->de, e->f, f->a, and then replacing a,e,f with 0 and b,c,d with 1.
%F A381101 Alternatively it can be generated by setting X(0) = X(1) = X(2) = 0 and X(n) = X(n-1) X(n-3)', where ' means take the binary complement of each symbol.  We find X(3) = 01, X(4) = 011, X(5) = 0111, X(6) = 011110, X(7) = 011110100, ... and the limiting sequence is this one.
%F A381101 In both cases, the iterates are of length A000930(n).
%Y A381101 Cf. A000930.
