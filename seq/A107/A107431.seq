%N A107431 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = maximal number of rounds for the social golfer problem with n groups of k golfers (n >= 2, 2 <= k <= n).
%C A107431 The problem is to find the largest number of rounds of golf that can be arranged with n*k golfers who play in n groups of k. No golfer may play in the same group as any other golfer twice (i.e., maximum socialization is achieved).
%C A107431 T(6,6) cannot be 4 since this would be equivalent to a pair of mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order 6.
%C A107431 T(n,k) = 1 for values of n and k outside this range.
%C A107431 The next term T(7,5) is known to be either 7 or 8.
%C A107431 T(n,n) = A001438(n) + 2. - _Floris P. van Doorn_, Sep 05 2019
