%N A107961 Pythagorean semiprimes: products of two Pythagorean primes (A002313).
%C A107961 Fermat's 4n+1 theorem, sometimes called Fermat's two-square theorem or simply "Fermat's theorem," states that a prime number p can be represented in an essentially unique manner (up to the order of addends) in the form x^2 + y^2 for integer x and y iff p = 1 (mod 4) or p = 2 (which is a degenerate case with x = y = 1). The theorem was stated by Fermat, but the first published proof was by Euler.
