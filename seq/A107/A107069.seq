%N A107069 Number of self-avoiding walks of length n on an infinite triangular prism starting at the origin.
%C A107069 The discrete space in which the walking happens is a triangular prism infinite in both directions along the x-axis. One vertex is the root, the origin. The basis is the set of single-step vectors, which we abbreviate as l (left), r (right), c (one step "clockwise" around the triangle) and c- (one step counterclockwise, more properly denoted c^-1).
%e A107069 a(0) = 1, as there is one self-avoiding walk of length 0, namely the null-walk (the walk whose steps are the null set).
%e A107069 a(1) = 4 because (using the terminology in the Comment), the 4 possible 1-step walks are W_1 = {l,r,c,c-}.
%e A107069 a(2) = 12 because the set of legal 2-step walks are {l^2, lc, lc-, r^2, rc, rc-, c^2, cl, cr, c^-2, c-l, c-r}.
%e A107069 a(3) = 34 because we have every W_2 concatenated with {l,r,c,c-} except for those with immediate violations (lr etc.) and those two which go in a triangle {c^3, c^-3}; hence a(3) = 3*a(2) - 2 = 3*12 - 2 = 36 - 2 = 34.
