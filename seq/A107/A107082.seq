%N A107082 Put in lexicographic order and concatenate all sequences that start with 0 and have difference sequences that use the digits 1 through 9 in order.
%C A107082 Sequence contains 1536 terms, including 336 distinct terms of which 147 appear exactly once. The 256 = 2^8 concatenated subsequences beginning with 0 have lengths 2 through 10, which occur 1, 8, 28, 56, 70, 56, 28, 8, 1 times, respectively, corresponding to C(8,k) = A007318(8,k), the number of ways 0 <= k <= 8 commas can be inserted between digits within "123456789". - _Rick L.
