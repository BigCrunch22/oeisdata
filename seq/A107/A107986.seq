%N A107986 Composite numbers of the form p+2 where p is prime.
%C A107986 This sequence is analogous to the sequence formed by the Goldbach-Euler conjecture that every even number greater than 2 is the sum of 2 primes. If p + 2 is prime then p and p + 2 are twin primes. The number of terms in this sequence is infinite. This follows immediately from the proof that the number of primes p is infinite. Conjecture: The ratio of the number of terms in this sequence to Pi(n) tends to a limit < 1.
%C A107986 The first term in this sequence that is not also in A062721 is 45 = 3^2 * 5. - _Alonso del Arte_, May 03 2014
