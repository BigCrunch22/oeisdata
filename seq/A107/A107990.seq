%N A107990 Primes representing areas of cube faces where the integer part of the cube's volume is also prime.
%C A107990 If the area of a single face of the cube is p, the volume is V=(sqrt(p))^3, and we look for cases where floor(V) and p are both prime.
%F A107990 {p in A000040: floor(p^(2/3)) in A000040}.
%e A107990 If the area of the cube is the prime p = 5, the side length is sqrt(5), the volume is 5^(3/2) = 11.18033..., and the truncated (floor) value of the volume is 11, a prime, which puts the prime p=5 to the sequence.
%o A107990 (PARI) g(n) = forprime(x=2,n,y=floor(sqrt(x)^3);if(isprime(y),print1(x, ",")))
