%N A107705 a(n) is the least number of prime factors in any non-deficient number that has the n-th prime as its least prime factor.
%C A107705 Barring unforeseen odd perfect numbers (which it has been proved must have at least 29 prime factors if they exist at all), if we replace "non-deficient" in the description with "abundant", the value of a(1) becomes 3 and all other values stay the same.
%C A107705 The above mentioned sequence is A108227, see there for a comment on the relation of this sequence to that of primitive abundant numbers (A006038) which are products of consecutive primes, i.e., of the form N = Product_{0<=i<r} prime(n+i) for some r. The corresponding non-deficient products are A007702. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jun 15 2017

%F A107705 a(n) = A007684(n)-n+1. A007702(n) = Product_{0<=i<a(n)} prime(n+i). - _M. F. Hasler_, Jun 15 2017
%e A107705 a(2) is 5 since 1) there are abundant numbers with a(2)=5 prime factors of which p_2=3 is the least prime factor (such as 945 = 3^3.5.7); 2) there are no non-deficient numbers with fewer than 5 prime factors, of which 3 is the least prime factor.
