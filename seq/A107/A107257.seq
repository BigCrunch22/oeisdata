%N A107257 Smallest prime p such that for each j <= n there are primes a < b <= p whose difference b - a is 2*j.
%C A107257 Every positive even number <= 2*n is the difference of two suitable primes <= a(n).
%C A107257 Sequence is nondecreasing, whereas the related sequence A020484 is not; first divergence is at 45: a(45) = 101, A020484(45) = 97.
%e A107257 Consider n = 45: 89, 97, 101 are consecutive primes, 2*45 = 97 - 7, but 2*44 = 101 - 13 cannot be written as b - a where a and b are primes <=97, hence a(45) = 101.
%Y A107257 Cf. A060264, A020484.
