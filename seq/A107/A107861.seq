%N A107861 Number of distinct values taken by the sums of all subsets of the n-th roots of unity.
%C A107861 Note that a(6)=19, a(12)=19^2 and a(18)=19^3. Similarly, a(10)=211 and a(20)=211^2. For prime n, a(n)=2^n-1. For powers of 2, we have a(2^n)=3^(2^(n-1)). It appears that _David W. Wilson_'s conjectured formula for A103314 may apply to this sequence also. Observe that due to symmetry, n divides a(n)-1.
%C A107861 Definition edited by _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 09 2020. The old definition was "Number of unique values in the sums of all subsets of the n-th roots of unity".

%e A107861 a(1)=2 as there are two distinct sums: the sum of the empty subset of roots is 0, and the sum of {1} is 1.
