%N A107427 Maximal number of simple triangular regions that can be formed by drawing n line segments in the Euclidean plane.
%C A107427 Draw n line segments on a piece of paper in such a way that if we make cuts along those lines, only triangular pieces are formed (apart from the "outside" region). Sequence gives maximal number of triangles that can be obtained.
%C A107427 Inspection of Loy's web page shows that these are known to be optimal only for n up to about 7.
%C A107427 Loy gives the following lower bounds for n = 1, 2, 3, ...: 0, 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 18, 22, 27, 32, 38, 44, 50, 54, 60, 72, 76, 84, 92, 110, 114, 122, 130, 156, 160, 210
