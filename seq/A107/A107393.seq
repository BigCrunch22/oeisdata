%N A107393 a(n) = -1 if n is a prime, else a(n) = 1 if n is the sum of three odd primes, else a(n) = 2 if n is the sum of two primes, else a(n) = 0.
%C A107393 A less natural variant of A051034, which counts the minimal number of primes that add up to n. The Goldbach conjecture implies that a(n) is nonzero for all n > 1.
%C A107393 The original definition was: "a(n) = -1 iff n is a prime, a(n) = 1 iff n is equal to the sum of three primes, a(n) = 2 iff n is equal to the sum of two primes, else a(n) = 0." However, the "iff"s do not make sense since all conditions can hold simultaneously. a(9) = 0 was obviously erroneous. More of the original data requires correction if "odd" is omitted in the second and/or added in the third condition, or if the conditions are tested in a different order.

%e A107393 a(9) = 1 because 9 is not a prime but it is the sum of three odd primes, 9 = 3 + 3 + 3.
