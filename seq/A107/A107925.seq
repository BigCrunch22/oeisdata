%N A107925 Odd numbers k such that k^2 is an arithmetic number.
%C A107925 Also, odd numbers k such that the arithmetic and geometric means of the divisors of k^2 are both integer.
%C A107925 Even numbers with this property are more rare and given by A107924.
%C A107925 Contains A002476 as a subsequence.
%C A107925 From _Jianing Song_, Apr 25 2022: (Start)
%C A107925 For p prime, p^(k-1) is a term in A003601 if and only if (p^k-1)/(p-1) is divisible by k. So p^e is a term here if and only if k | (p^k-1)/(p-1) for k = 2*e+1. (Note that p cannot be equal to 2 if k | (p^k-1)/(p-1).)
%C A107925 If a,b are both here, gcd(a,b) = 1, then a*b is also here. If a is A107924 and b is here, gcd(a,b) = 1, then a*b is also in A107924.
%C A107925 Let r >= 1, p_1, p_2, ..., p_r be distinct primes, k_1, k_2, ..., k_r be odd numbers such that Product_{i=1..r} (p_i)^(k_i) is an arithmetic number. Then there exists a number i in 1..r such that (p_i)^(k_i) is an arithmetic number. See my link for a proof. (End)
