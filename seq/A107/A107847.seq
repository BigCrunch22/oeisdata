%N A107847 Related to sums of the n-th roots of unity: sums in a circular wedge (excluding the origin).
%C A107847 Consider the 2^n sums formed from all the subsets of the n-th roots of unity. The number A103314(n) tells how many of these sums are zero. The remaining sums fall into n wedges centered at the origin. The number a(n) gives the number of sums that fall into each wedge. Interestingly, a(n) coincides with A059966(n) when n is either p^k or pq for primes p and q.

%F A107847 a(n) = (2^n - A103314(n))/n.
%F A107847 a(n) = A001037(n) - A110981(n). - _Max Alekseyev_, Jan 14 2008
%Y A107847 Cf. A103314 (number of subsets of the n-th roots of unity summing to zero), A107848 (number of subsets of the n-th roots of unity summing to a real number).
%Y A107847 Cf. also A110981.
