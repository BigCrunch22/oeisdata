%N A107845 Transposable-digit primes: Primes such that if any single pair of adjacent digits is transposed the result is a prime.
%C A107845 A single transposition error (of decimal digits) when recording or communicating such a prime still results in a prime (possibly the same prime). A003459 and A004022 (its subsequence) are subsequences. A003459 is also a subsequence of A068652.

%e A107845 137 is a term because it is prime and 173 and 317 are also prime.
%e A107845 173 is not a term because 713 is not prime (even though 173 and 137 are prime). {Hence none of 137,173,317,371,713,731 is a term of A003459.}
%e A107845 3119 is a term because it is prime and 1319 and 3191 are primes.
%e A107845 As 3119, 1193, 1931 and 9311 are all prime, 3119 is also a term of A068652.
%e A107845 Finally, although 1913 is also prime, neither 1139, 1391, 3911, 9113, nor 9131 is prime so 3119's twelve total permutations are not terms of A003459.
