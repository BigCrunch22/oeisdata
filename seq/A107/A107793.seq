%N A107793 Differences between successive indices of 1's in the ternary tribonacci sequence A305390.
%C A107793 Average value is 4.38095...
%C A107793 Conjecture (_N. J. A. Sloane_, Jun 22 2018) This is a disguised form of A275925. More precisely, if we replace the 5's by 6's and the 4's by 5's, and ignore the first two terms, we appear to get a sequence which is a shifted version of A275925.

%E A107793 Edited (and checked) by _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jun 21 2018 (the original version did not make it clear that this is based on only one of the three tribonacci sequences A305389, A305390, A305391).
