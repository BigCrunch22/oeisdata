%N A121946 Let r be the matrix {{1,1},{0,1}} and b={{1,0},{1,0}}. Let A be the semigroup generated by r and b. a(n) is the number of words of length n in A.
%C A121946 The generating function was found by _Moshe Shmuel Newman_.

%F A121946 G.f.: 1/(1-x)+ x/((1-x)^2 (1-x^2)(1-x^3)(1-x^5)(1-x^7)(1-x^11)...) where the product is over all primes.
%e A121946 The products of two matrices in A are r.r, r.b, b.r and b.b, that is {{1, 2}, {0, 1}}, {{2, 0}, {1, 0}}, {{1, 1}, {1, 1}}, {{1, 0}, {1, 0}}.
%e A121946 Of these, the last one, b.b is an element of length one, since it is equal to b. The remainder are elements of length two, hence a(2)=3.
%Y A121946 The first differences are A034891, the second differences are A000607.
