%N A121380 Sums of primitive roots for n (or 0 if n has no primitive roots).
%C A121380 In Article 81 of his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae (1801), Gauss proves that the sum of all primitive roots (A001918) of a prime p, mod p, equals MoebiusMu[p-1] (A008683). "The sum of all primitive roots is either = 0 (mod p) (when p-1 is divisible by a square), or = +-1 (mod p) (when p-1 is the product of unequal prime numbers; if the number of these is even the sign is positive but if the number is odd, the sign is negative)."

%e A121380 The primitive roots of 13 are 2, 6, 7, 11. Their sum is 26, or 0 (mod 13). By Gauss, 13-1=12 is thus divisible by a square number.
