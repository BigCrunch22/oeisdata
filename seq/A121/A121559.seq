%N A121559 Final result (0 or 1) under iterations of {r mod (max prime p <= r)} starting at r = n.
%C A121559 Previous name: Find r1 = n modulo p1, where p1 is the largest prime not greater than n. Then find r2 = r1 modulo p2, where p2 is the largest prime not greater than r1. Repeat until the last r is either 1 or 0; a(n) is the last r value.
%C A121559 The sequence has the form of blocks of 0's between 1's. See sequence A121560 for the lengths of the blocks of zeros.
%C A121559 The function r mod (max prime p <= r), which appears in the definition, equals r - (max prime p <= r) = A064722(r), because p <= r < 2*p by Bertrand's postulate, where p is the largest prime less than or equal to r. - _Pontus von Brömssen_, Jul 31 2022

%e A121559 a(9) = 0 because 7 is the largest prime not larger than 9, 9 mod 7 = 2, 2 is the largest prime not greater than 2 and 2 mod 2 = 0.
