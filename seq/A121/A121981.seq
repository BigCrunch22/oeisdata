%N A121981 Number of finite maximal bifix codes of degree n on a two-letter alphabet.
%C A121981 A bifix (sometimes biprefix) code is a set of nonempty words X such that no word of X is a proper prefix or a proper suffix of another. The degree of a finite maximal bifix code X is the maximal number of parses that a word can have with respect to X.
%C A121981 It is known that there are finitely many finite maximal bifix codes of each degree.
