%N A121215 a(1)=1. a(n) = n-th integer from among those positive integers which do not occur earlier in the sequence and which are not coprime to n.
%e A121215 2,3,6,8,12,14,15,16,...is the sequence of positive integers which do not occur among the first 5 terms of the sequence and which are not coprime to 6. 14 is the 6th of these integers, so a(6) = 14.
