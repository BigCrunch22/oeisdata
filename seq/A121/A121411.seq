%N A121411 Positive integers k for which there are primes of the form a^2+k^n=b^2+k^m with positive integers (a,b,m,n) and a > b.
%C A121411 The sequence is "hard" in the sense that it is not known how to prove that the necessary conditions are sufficient for the existence of primes.
%H A121411 David Broadhurst and Mike Oakes, <a href="https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;a5fc6134.0607">Primes of the form a^2 + k^n = b^2 + k^m</a>.
%H A121411 David Broadhurst and Mike Oakes, <a href="http://physics.open.ac.uk/~dbroadhu/cert/dbmothrm.txt">proof</a> of the necessity the conditions given for the conjectured generating method.
%F A121411 Conjecturally, a(n) is the n-th positive nonsquare integer that is not congruent to -1 mod 4, nor to -1 mod 5, nor to -7 mod 16.
%e A121411 a(5455)=9998 because it was possible to find primes of the form a^2 + k^n = b^2 + k^m with positive integers (a,b,k,m,n), a > b, k < 10^4 and k satisfying the proved necessary conditions of the conjectured generating method.
