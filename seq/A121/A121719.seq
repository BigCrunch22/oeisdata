%N A121719 Strings of digits which are composite regardless of the base in which they are interpreted. Exclude bases in which numbers are not interpretable.
%C A121719 Comments from _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_:
%C A121719 "Think of these as polynomials. E.g. 121 is the polynomial n^2+2n+1. There are three cases:
%C A121719 "(1) If the coefficients (digits) all have a common factor, the result will be divisible by that factor.
%C A121719 "(2) If the polynomial can be factored, the numbers will be composite. n^2+2n+1 = (n+1)^2, so it is always composite.
%C A121719 "(3) Otherwise, look at the polynomial modulo primes up to its degree. For example, 112 (n^2+n+2, degree 2) modulo 2 is always 0, so it is always divisible by 2.
%C A121719 "Note that condition (1) is really a special case of condition (2), where one of the factors is a constant.
%C A121719 "If none of the above conditions apply, the polynomial will (probably) have prime values."
%C A121719 From _Iain Fox_, Sep 02 2020: (Start)
%C A121719 lim_{k->infinity} (1/k)*Sum_{i=1..k} a_c(i) > .3 if it exists, where a_c(n) is the characteristic function of a(n) (1 if n is in a(n), otherwise 0).
%C A121719 If the Bunyakovsky conjecture is true, the list of reasons a number is in this sequence detailed by _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_ above is a complete list.
%C A121719 If the Bunyakovsky conjecture and the Extended Riemann Hypothesis are true, the above limit equals 4340435807/13235512500 = 0.3279386... (proof by Ravi Fernando in link by Iain Fox).
%C A121719 All members of A008592 except 1 and 10 are in this sequence.
