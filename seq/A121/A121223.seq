%N A121223 Number of degeneracies on the sets of ordinary trees with n vertices according to a topological index.
%C A121223 Konstantinova and Vidyuk compare various topological indices for their power to discriminate a large set of hexagonal, square and triangular lattice animals.
%C A121223 This here is an overview for the H_lambda^p index (a particular logarithmic weight over the layer matrix) for a test set of 11 ordinary trees (with n=7 vertices), 23 ordinary trees (with n= 8 vertices) etc. A "good" index is indicated by resulting in low degeneracies.

%e A121223 For the test set of 7741 trees with n=15 vertices, the H_lambda^p index ended up in 1947 degeneracies.
