%N A121274 a(n) = n-th integer from among those positive integers which are coprime to (n-th integer from among those positive integers which are coprime to n).
%e A121274 6 is the 5th positive integer which is coprime to 5. (1,2,3,4,6,7,8.... is the sequence of positive integers which are coprime to 5 and 6 is the 5th such integer.) 1,5,7,11,13,17,19,... are the positive integers which are coprime to 6. 13 is the 5th of these integers, so a(5) = 13.
