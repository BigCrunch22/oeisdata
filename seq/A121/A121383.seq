%N A121383 a(0)=3. a(n) = number of earlier terms which, each added to n, sum to a square.
%C A121383 Does every nonnegative integer occur eventually? Analogous to A123396 a(0)=0. a(n) = number of earlier terms each of which, when added to n, the sum is a triangular number.

%e A121383 a(6) = 1 because the previous terms are 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, and among them only one (3) added to 6 gives a square (9).
