%N A121198 Number of one-sided chessboard polyominoes with n cells (similar to but different from A001071).
%C A121198 Consider the tiling of the plane with squares of two different sizes as seen for example in Fig. 2.4.2(g) of Grünbaum and Shephard, p. 74. Sequence gives the number of "n-PairSquares", that is, polyominoes or animals that can be formed on this tiling from "n big or little squares, where the conjunction between two squares must involve an entire edge at least". - Original description (_N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 17 2006, with quote from Livio Zucca's site)
%C A121198 Also counts one-sided polyominoes cut from an infinite chessboard with the usual coloring (big and little squares in Fig. 2.4.2(g) of Grünbaum and Shephard are equivalent to the two colors on a chessboard, and ignoring connections that are not a whole edge of one square means the connectivity is also equivalent); see Myers link regarding difference from A001071 for even terms a(6) onwards. - _Joseph Myers_, Oct 01 2011

%F A121198 From _John Mason_, Dec 24 2021: (Start)
%F A121198 For odd n, a(n) = 2*A000105(n) + 2*A030228(n).
%F A121198 For n multiple of 2 but not of 4, a(n) = 2*A000105(n) + 2*A030228(n) - A346799(n/2) - 2*A234008(n/2).
%F A121198 For n multiple of 4, a(n) = 2*A000105(n) + 2*A030228(n) - A346799(n/2) - 2*A234008(n/2) - A234009(n/4) - A234007(n/4). (End)
