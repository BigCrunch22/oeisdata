%N A121090 Period of unit fractions having periodic decimal expansions.
%C A121090 See A007732, which is the main entry for this sequence.
%F A121090 a(n) = A007732(A085837(n)). - _Kevin Ryde_, May 05 2023
%e A121090 The first unit fraction considered is 1/3 because both 1/1 and 1/2 have finite decimal expansions.
%e A121090 a(1) = 1 because 1/3=.33333... whose repeating portion, 3, is of length 1.
%e A121090 Note: 1/4 and 1/5 are skipped because their decimal expansions are finite.
%e A121090 a(2) = 1 because 1/6=.166666... whose repeating portion, 6, is of length 1.
%e A121090 a(3) = 6 because 1/7 =.142857142857... whose repeating portion, 142857, is of length 6.
