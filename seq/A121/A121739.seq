%N A121739 Dimensions of the irreducible representations of the simple Lie algebra of type D4 over the complex numbers, listed in increasing order.
%C A121739 We include "1" for the 1-dimensional trivial representation and we list each dimension once, ignoring the fact that inequivalent representations may have the same dimension.

%F A121739 Given a vector of 4 nonnegative integers, the Weyl dimension formula tells you the dimension of the corresponding irreducible representation. The list of such dimensions is then sorted numerically.
%e A121739 The highest weight 0000 corresponds to the 1-dimensional module on which D4 acts trivially. The second second term in the sequence is 8, corresponding to the three inequivalent representations with highest weights 1000, 0010 and 0001 respectively. The third term in the sequence is 28, corresponding to the adjoint representation, which has highest weight 0100.
