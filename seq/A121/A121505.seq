%N A121505 Hit triangle for unit circle area (Pi) approximation problem described in A121500.
%C A121505 Record for n=3,4,... only those (n, A121500(n)) pairs which have relative error E(n, A121500(n)) smaller than all errors with smaller n. This produces the table a(n,m).
%C A121505 The unit circle area is approximated by the arithmetic mean of the areas of an inscribed regular n-gon and a circumscribed regular m-gon.
%C A121505 For each row n>=3 the minimal relative error E(n,m):= ((Fin(n) + Fout(m))/2-Pi)/ Pi) appears for m= A121500(n).
%C A121505 The same hit triangle is obtained when one considers the minimal relative errors for the columns m>=3 and collects the sequence with decreasing errors, starting with m=3.
