%N A121611 Number of ways to express n as an average of three distinct primes.
%C A121611 For odd n's a(n) are much larger than a(n-/+1). Cf. A061357 = number of ways n can be expressed as the mean of two distinct primes, A061357 = number of ways the even integer 2n can be written as the sum of two primes for all even integers >6.
%e A121611 a(4)=1 because 4 = (2+3+7)/3 (1 way),
%e A121611 a(6)=2 because 6 = (2+3+13)/3 = (2+5+11)/3 (2 ways)
%e A121611 a(9)=3 because 9 = (3+5+19)/3 = (3+7+17)/3 = (3+11+13)/3 (3 ways)
%e A121611 a(11)=4 because 11 = (3+7+23)/3 = (3+11+19)/3 = (3+13+17)/3 = (5+11+19)/3 (4 ways), etc.
%Y A121611 Cf. A061357, A061357.
