%U A121091 919
%N A121091 Smallest nexus prime of the form n^p - (n-1)^p, where p is an odd prime.
%C A121091 a(19) = 19^1607 - 18^1607, which is too large to include. It has 2055 decimal digits. See A062585(1) = 1607.
%C A121091 a(20)-a(21) = {723901, 8005616640331026125580781}. a(n) is currently known for all n up to n = 96. Corresponding smallest odd primes p such that (n+1)^p - n^p is prime are listed in A125713(n) = {3,3,3,3,5,3,7,7,3,3,3,17,3,3,43,5,3,10957,5,19,127,229,3,3,3,13,3,3,149,3,5,3,23,3,5,83,3,3,37,7,3,3,37,5,3,5,58543,...}. a(n+1) = A065013(n) for n = {4, 7, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, 22, 24, 25, 27, 28, 31, ...} = A047845(n) = (n-1)/2, where n runs through odd nonprimes (A014076), for n>1.
%F A121091 a(n) = n^A125713(n) - (n-1)^A125713(n).
