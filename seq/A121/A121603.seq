%N A121603 Numbers n such that the radius of the smallest circle into which n unit circles can be packed is 1 + csc(Pi/k), where k >= 2 is an integer.
%C A121603 Corresponding k values are in A121604. For these n, the centers of k unit circles can form a regular k-gon with sides of length 2 centered at the center of the larger circle. From the diagrams in the link it appears likely that 13,18,19 are the next three terms.

%e A121603 See A121602 for the case n=11 involving a 9-gon.
