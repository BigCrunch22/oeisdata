%N A121573 Prime-gap race; difference of the cumulative sums of gaps above and below prime(2n).
%C A121573 This sequence was inspired by seeing two lines in the plot of A008347. It was expected that, on average, the gaps above prime(2n) would be larger than the gaps below prime(2n) and hence a(n) would be a mostly positive sequence. With some exceptions, this is true for the first 6330 terms. However, as the plot shows, over 500000 negative terms follow!

%F A121573 a(n) = Sum_{k=1..n} (prime(2k+1) - prime(2k)) - Sum_{k=1..n} (prime(2k) - prime(2k-1)).
%F A121573 a(n) = Sum_{k=1..n} A036263(2k-1).
%F A121573 a(n) = prime(2n+1) - 2*A008347(2n) - 2.
%e A121573 a(6)=1 because the prime gaps above and below the even-indexed primes (3,7,13,19,29,37) are 2,4,4,4,2,4 and 1,2,2,2,6,6, respectively. The sums of these gaps are 20 and 19, which differ by 1.
