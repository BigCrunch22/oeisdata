%N A121445 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of ternary trees with n edges and such that the first leaf in the preorder traversal is at level k (1<=k<=n). A ternary tree is a rooted tree in which each vertex has at most three children and each child of a vertex is designated as its left or middle or right child.
%C A121445 Sum of terms in row n is A001764(n+1). T(n,1)=A121446(n) Sum(k*T(n,k),k=1..n)=A121447(n).
%F A121445 G.f.=G=G(t,z)=1/[1-t(h-1-z)/(h-1)]-1, where h=1+zh^3=2sin(arcsin(sqrt(27z/4))/3)/sqrt(3z).
%e A121445 T(1,1)=3 because we have the trees /, | and \.
%e A121445 T(2,1)=3 because we have the trees /|, /\ and |\.
