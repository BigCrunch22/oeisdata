%N A121390 Sequence generated by the recurrence below begins with exactly seven primes.
%C A121390 This sequence has the smallest value of a(1) for a(0) = 2 and this recurrence such that the first seven terms are primes. The first composite term is too large to include. Note also that each a(n) has Fibonacci(n) trailing 9's (see A121389).
%F A121390 a(0) = 2; a(1) = 8607769; a(n) = a(n-2)*a(n-1) + a(n-2) + a(n-1).
%e A121390 a(2) = 25823309 = 2*8607769 + 2 + 8607769 and is prime.
