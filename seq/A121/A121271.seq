%N A121271 Number of different vertex-degree sequences of simple 3-uniform hypergraphs on n vertices.
%e A121271 a(3)=2 counts these two degree sequences: (0,0,0) and (1,1,1), the former corresponding to the empty 3-uniform hypergraph with no hyperedges and the latter for the 3-uniform hypergraph having the unique hyperedge {1,2,3}.
