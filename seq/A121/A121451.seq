%N A121451 Maximum product over partitions into parts of the form 3k+2.
%C A121451 With the exception of the first three terms of this sequence and the first two terms of A094958, these two sequences appear to be identical.
%F A121451 Conjecture. a(1)=a(3)=0, otherwise a(n)=2^(n/2) if n is even and a(n)=5*2^((n-5)/2) if n is odd. (This has been verified for up to n=40.)
%e A121451 The only partition of 7 into parts of the form 3k+2 is {5,2}, so the maximum product is a(7)=10.
%Y A121451 Cf. A000792, A034893, A094958.
