%N A121997 Count up to n, n times.
%C A121997 The n-th block consists of n subblocks, each of which counts from 1 to n.
%C A121997 This a fractal sequence: removing the first instance of each value leaves the original sequence.
%C A121997 The first comment implies that this gives the column index of the n-th element of a sequence whose terms are coefficients, read by rows, of a sequence of matrices of size 1 X 1, 2 X 2, 3 X 3, etc.; cf. example. The row index is given by A238013(n), and the size of the matrix by A074279(n). - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 16 2014

%e A121997 The blocks of n subblocks of n terms (n=1,2,3,...) can be cast into a square matrices of order n; then the terms are equal to the index of the column they fall into.
