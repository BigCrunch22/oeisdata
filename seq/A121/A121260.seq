%N A121260 Beginning with a(1)=0, take a(n) to be the smallest number not equal to the product of two consecutive (not distinct) earlier terms.
%C A121260 Apparently the definition is: a(1)=0. For even n, a(n)=a(n-1). For odd n, a(n) is the smallest value > a(n-1) which is not equal to some product a(i)*a(i-1) of two consecutive earlier terms. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jun 21 2021
