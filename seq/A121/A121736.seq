%N A121736 Dimensions of the irreducible representations of the simple Lie algebra of type E7 over the complex numbers, listed in increasing order.
%C A121736 We include "1" for the 1-dimensional trivial representation and we list each dimension once, ignoring the possibility that inequivalent representations may have the same dimension.

%F A121736 Given a vector of 7 nonnegative integers, the Weyl dimension formula tells you the dimension of the corresponding irreducible representation. The list of such dimensions is then sorted numerically.
%e A121736 The highest weight 0000000 corresponds to the 1-dimensional module on which E7 acts trivially. The smallest faithful representation of E7 is the so-called "standard" representation of dimension 56 (the second term in the sequence), with highest weight 0000001; it is minuscule and supports the famous invariant quartic form. The adjoint representation of dimension 133 (the third term in the sequence), has highest weight 1000000.
