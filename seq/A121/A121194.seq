%S A121194 1,2,10,84
%N A121194 Number of n-celled polyominoes, where the cells are 1 X 2 rectangles with one edge of length 2 replaced by a curved arc that either sags inwards or bulges outwards, subject to some restrictions.
%C A121194 This is the result of trying to infer the rules behind A056755. The match is not exact - these rules allow 16 3-celled polyominoes not allowed in A056755. However, the reason for the exclusion of those 16 polyominoes in A056755 is not clear.
%C A121194 The restrictions are: all curved edges must be on the boundary of the polyomino, each side of the polyomino must be either all curved, or all straight and if two cells meet on a side of length 2, they must share the whole side. Polyominoes are allowed to be rotated and reflected.
