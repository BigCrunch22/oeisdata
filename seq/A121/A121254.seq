%N A121254 Number of conjugated cycles composed of six carbons in (n,n)-nanotubes in terms of the number of naphthalene units.

%F A121254 Conjecture: a(n)=6a(n-1)-11a(n-2)+6a(n-3)-a(n-4)=4*A117202(n). G.f.: 4*x*(1-2*x+2*x^2)/(x^2-3*x+1)^2. [From _R. J. Mathar_, Mar 18 2009]
%e A121254 If n=5 then the number of conjugated cycles composed of six carbons in (n,n)-nanotubes is 680 which is the fifth term in the sequence. Here n is the number of naphthalene units.
