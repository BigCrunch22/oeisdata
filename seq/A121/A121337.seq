%N A121337 Number of idempotent relations on n labeled elements.
%C A121337 A relation r is idempotent if r ; r = r, where ; denotes sequential composition.
%C A121337 From _Geoffrey Critzer_, Oct 18 2023 : (Start)
%C A121337 a(n) is also the number of maximal subgroups in the semigroup of binary relations on [n].  See Butler and Markowski link.
%C A121337 A binary relation is idempotent iff it is both dense (A355730) and transitive (A006905).
%C A121337 A binary relation is idempotent iff it is both limit dominating (A366194) and limit dominated (A366722).  See Gregory, Kirkland, and Pullman link.
%C A121337 A binary relation R on [n] is idempotent iff the following biconditional statement holds for all x,y in [n]:  There is a cyclic traverse from x to y in G(R) iff (x,y) is in R.  Here, G(R) is the directed graph with self loops allowed (A002416) corresponding to R.  See Rosenblatt link.
%C A121337 Let Q be a quasi-order (A000798) on [n].  Let D(X) be the relation {(x,x):x is in X}.  Let S be a subset of [n] such that: (i) For all x in S, the class in the equivalence relation Q intersect Q^(-1) containing (x,x) is a singleton and (ii) for all x,y in S, the component containing x is not covered by the component containing y in the condensation of G(Q) .  Here, the condensation of G(Q) is the acyclic digraph (A003024) obtained from G(Q) by replacing every strongly connected component (SCC) by a single vertex and all directed edges from one SCC to another with a single directed edge.  Then a relation is idempotent iff it is of the form Q-D(S).  See Schein link.  (End)

%e A121337 a(2) = 11 because given a set {a,b} of two elements, of the 2^(2*2) = 16 relations on the set, only 5 are not idempotent. - _Michael Somos_, Jul 28 2013
%e A121337 These 5 relations that are not idempotent are: {(a,b)}, {(b,a)}, {(a,b),(b,a)}, {(a,b),(b,a),(b,b)}, {(a,a),(a,b),(b,a)}. - _Geoffrey Critzer_, Aug 07 2016
