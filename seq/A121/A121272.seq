%N A121272 Number of outcomes of unlabeled n-team round-robin tournaments that are not uniquely defined by their score vectors.
%C A121272 This sequence is the difference between A000568 (Number of outcomes of unlabeled n-team round-robin tournaments) and A000570 (Number of tournaments on n nodes determined by their score vectors).

%e A121272 All tournaments with 4 or fewer teams are uniquely defined by their score vectors. Hence a(1) = a(2) = a(3) = a(4) = 0.
%e A121272 For five-team tournaments only two score sequences do not define the tournament uniquely: {1,1,2,3,3} and {1,2,2,2,3}. The first sequence corresponds to two different tournaments and the second sequence to three different tournaments. Thus a(5) = 5.
%Y A121272 Cf. A000568, A000570.
