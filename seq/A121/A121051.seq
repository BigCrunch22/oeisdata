%N A121051 Semiprimes which are sums of 4 but no fewer nonzero squares.
%C A121051 Semiprime analog of A007522 Primes of form 8n+7. These semiprimes must all be numbers of the form 4^i(8j+7), i >= 0, j >= 0. However, for positive i, 4^i(8j+7) has more than 2 prime factors (with multiplicity). Hence from Legendre's corollary to Lagrange's Four-Square Theorem, this sequence is precisely Semiprimes of the form 8*k+7.
