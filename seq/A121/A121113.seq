%N A121113 Edge-rooted tree-like octagonal systems (see the Cyvin et al. reference for precise definition).
%C A121113 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, Jul 30 2019: (Start)
%C A121113 Quoting from p. 59 in Cyvin et al. (1997): "When an octagon is rooted at an edge ... then either (a) one branch can be attached in five directions at a time, (b) two branches can be attached in six ways, or (c) three branches in one way. Let the numbers of these kinds of systems be denoted by (a) U_r^*, (b) U_r^{**}, and (c) U_r^{***}, respectively."
%C A121113 Here r is "the number of octagons or eight-membered rings" in an edge-rooted catapolygon (here, catapolyoctagon). A catapolyoctagon is a "catacondensed polygonal system consisting of octagons" (where "catacondensed" means it has no internal vertices).
%C A121113 On p. 59 in Cyvin et al. (1997), the total number of edge-rooted catapolyoctagons (each with r octagons) is denoted by U_r, and we have U_r = U_r^* + U_r^{**} + U_r^{***} for r >= 2.
%C A121113 We have U_r = A036758(r), U_r^* = A121112(r), U_r^{**} = a(r) (current sequence), and U_r^{***} = A121114(r) for r >= 1.
%C A121113 For the current sequence, we have a(r) = U_r^{**} = 6*Sum_{i = 1.. r-2} U(i) * U(r-1-i) for r >= 3, where U(r) = A036758(r), with a(1) = a(2) = 0. See Eq. (12) in Cyvin et al. (1997).
%C A121113 The ultimate purpose of these calculations (in the paper by Cyvin et al. (1997)) is the calculation of I_r = A036760(r), which is the "number of nonisomorphic free (unrooted) catapolyoctagons when r is given." These catapolyoctagons "represent a class of polycyclic conjugated hydrocarbons, C_{6r+2} H_{4r+4}" (see p. 57 in Cyvin et al. (1997)).
%C A121113 The g.f.'s of the sequences U, U^*, U^{**}, and U^{***} appear also in Eqs. (2) and (3) on p. 194 in Brunvoll et al. (1997).
