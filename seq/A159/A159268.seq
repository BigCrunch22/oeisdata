%N A159268 Largest m<=n such that 2^m+3^n is prime, 0 if no such m exists.
%C A159268 For n>0, a(n)=0 means that there is no such m, since 2^0+3^n cannot be prime for n>0.
%e A159268 a(0)=0 since 2^0+3^0=2 is prime.
%e A159268 a(18)=14 is the largest integer m <= 18 such that 2^m+3^18 is prime.
%e A159268 a(19)=0 since there is no integer m <= 19 such that 2^m+3^19 is prime.
