%N A159687 Number of strong primes < 10^n.
%C A159687 The number of strong primes < n ~ sum of strong primes < sqrt(n). The number of strong primes < 10^11 = 2014200162 and the sum of strong primes < 10^5.5 = 1972716560, for an error of 0.0206.

%F A159687 Given 3 consecutive primes p1,p2,p3, p2 is a strong prime if p2 > (p1+p2)/2.
%F A159687 Or, primes that are greater than the arithmetic mean of their immediate surrounding primes.
%e A159687 The strong primes < 10^2 are 11, 17, 29, 37, 41, 59, 67, 71, 79, 97. These add up to 10 which is the second term in the sequence.
