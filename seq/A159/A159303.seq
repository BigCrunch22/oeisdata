%N A159303 a(n) is the least L^1-norm of a square integer matrix of determinant n. The L^1-norm of the matrix M=(m_i,j) is by definition sum(i,j) |m_i,j|.

%F A159303 It is shown in the paper cited above that lim a(p)/lg(p) = 5/2, where the limit is over primes p tending to infinity and where lg is the logarithm base 2.
%e A159303 a(17) = 10 from the 2-by-2 matrix (4 -1\\1 4). This matrix has determinant 17 and L^1-norm 10 = 4 + 1 + 1 + 4. No square integer matrix has determinant 17 and L^1-norm < 10.
