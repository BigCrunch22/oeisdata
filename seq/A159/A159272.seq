%N A159272 Smallest integer m, in absolute value, such that |m(n+m)| has as prime factors exactly all primes <= sqrt(n); take m > 0 if m and -m both are solutions; a(n) = 0 if no such m exists.
%C A159272 As of today, the first unknown value is a(397).
%C A159272 For all n = 4, ..., 396, we know a way to write n = a +/- b where the prime factors of a*b are exactly all primes <= sqrt(n). This sequence lists min(a,b), with a minus sign if n = a + b (to have a(n) > 0 for most n).
%C A159272 If n is a prime, this value constitutes a proof of its primality, since then either a or b, but not both, and thus n, are nonzero (mod p) for each prime < sqrt(n).
%C A159272 Are a(152) = -42 and a(167) = -35 the last two negative values? - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 17 2024

%e A159272 For n < 4, a(n) = 0 by convention, or with the justification that there are no primes <= sqrt(n), and 0*(n+0) = 0 also has no prime factors (by convention).
%e A159272 For all larger n, |m*(n+m)| must have at least the prime factor 2, so m = 0 can't be a solution as above for n < 4, nor can it be m = -n.
%e A159272 For n = 4, a(4) = -2 because 2*(4-2) = 2*2 has only 2 as prime factor, and this is also the only prime <= sqrt(n) = 2. One easily checks that m = +-1 and m = 2 is not a solution.
%e A159272 For n = 5, a(5) = -1 because 1*(5-1) = 4 = 2*2 has only 2 as prime factor, which is also the only prime up to sqrt(5) ~ 2.236.
%e A159272 a(30) = 30 because 30*(30+30) = 1800 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^2 has exactly all primes < sqrt(30) ~ 5.5 as prime factors, and one can check that no smaller m yields a solution.
