%N A159464 Indices of "Pithagorean" (not Pythagorean!) triples with prime initial terms.
%C A159464 In theory, it would seem this sequence is infinite even though only triples up prime 43 are found in the first 1 billion digits of Pi. The odds of finding a hit can be overwhelming as the number of digits in the triples becomes large. My guess is this observable universe is finite.

%F A159464 A "Pithagorean" triple is a Pythagorean triple whose concatenated digits are found in the digital expansion of Pi. This sequence is a special case of the index when the first term of the triple is and odd prime.
%e A159464 The concatenated Pythagorean triple 345 is found starting in position 1701 of the expansion of the digits of Pi. Reading a Pifast43 compressed file enables you to search huge strings.
