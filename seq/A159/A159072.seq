%N A159072 Count of numbers k in the range 1<=k<= n such that set of proper divisors of k is not a subset of the set of the proper divisors of n.
%C A159072 Here proper divisors include 1 but not the argument (k or n, respectively) in the divisor set, as defined in A032741.
%C A159072 We use the (nonstandard) terminology that the empty set (the proper divisors of 1) is not a subset of another set.
%F A159072 a(n)+A159070(n) = n. - _R. J. Mathar_, Apr 06 2009
%e A159072 a(8) = 2 counts k=6 with divisors set {1, 2, 3} (not subset of the divisors {1, 2, 4} of n = 8), and k=1 without proper divisors.
