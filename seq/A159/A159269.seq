%N A159269 Least positive integer such that 2^m+3^n or 2^n+3^m is prime.
%C A159269 It seems that a(n)<=n for all n>0.
%F A159269 a(n) = min { A123359(n), A159266(n) }
%e A159269 a(0)=1 since 2^1+3^0=3 is prime.
%e A159269 a(1)=1 since 2^1+3^1=5 is prime.
%e A159269 a(2)=1 since 2^2+3^1=7, or 2^1+3^2=11, is prime. (Only one prime is required).
%e A159269 a(3)=1 since 2^3+3^1=11 and also 2^1+3^3=29, are prime.
%e A159269 a(4)=1 since 2^4+3^1=19 (and also 2^1+3^4=83) are prime.
%e A159269 a(5)=2 is the least integer m such that 2^5+3^m (=41) is prime and 2^m+3^5 is not prime until A159267(5)=4.
