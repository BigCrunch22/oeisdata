%N A159944 Number of different deltoids (including squares) whose vertices are on an n X n grid.
%C A159944 Only convex kites (A189417) are counted, not concave kites (A173502), distinct up to congruence.
%H A159944 Nathaniel Johnston, <a href="/A159944/a159944.c.txt">C program for computing terms</a>
%e A159944 a(1) = 0, since there is only one point on a 1 X 1 grid.
%e A159944 a(2) = 1, since the four points on a 2 X 2 grid build a 1 X 1 square.
%e A159944 a(3) = 4 since there are 3 sizes of squares on a 3 X 3 grid -- 1 X 1, 2 X 2, sqrt(2) X sqrt(2) -- and a single nonsquare deltoid.
%Y A159944 Cf. A189417, A173502.
