%N A209932 Numbers n such that smallest digit of all divisors of n is 0.
%C A209932 Also numbers n such that smallest digit of concatenation of all divisors of n (A037278 or A176558) is 0.
%C A209932 Sequence is not the same as A011540, first deviation is at a(41): A011540(41) = 220, a(41) = 214.
%e A209932 Number 214 is in sequence because smallest digit of all divisors of 214 (1, 2, 107, 214) is 0.
