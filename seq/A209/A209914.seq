%N A209914 Number of ways n can be written as a multiple of its reversal A004086(n) +/- a prime p < n.
%C A209914 If n is not a multiple of 10, then a(n) < 20. The subsequence { a(10k) }, however, is unbounded. In particular, a(10^k)=2*A006880(k).
%e A209914 a(10)=8 because R(10)=01=1 and 10 = 3*1 + 7 = 5*1 + 5 = 7*1 + 3 = 8*1 + 2 = 12*1 - 2 = 13*1 - 3 = 15*1 - 5 = 17*1 - 7.
