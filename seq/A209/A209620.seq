%N A209620 Emirps that become their own reversals when rotated through 180 degrees (including on calculator display).
%C A209620 Such emirps have end digits 1 and use only digits 0, 1, 2, 5, 8, and the sequence naturally includes A155512, the emirps with only digits 0 and 1.
%e A209620 1181 of this sequence, for instance, belongs to the emirp pair (1181, 1811), where each member is a 180-degree rotation of the other; similarly for the term 112501 of this sequence, that belongs to the emirp pair (105211, 112501) and which, displayed on a calculator and turned upside-down, becomes its own reversal.
