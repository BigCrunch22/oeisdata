%N A209355 Sequence with each term appearing in runs of every length infinitely often.
%C A209355 This construction is in stages for sequence range 0, 1:
%C A209355 Stage 1: 0, 1
%C A209355 Stage 2: 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1
%C A209355 Stage 3: 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, etc.,
%C A209355 where each stage is the previous stage (if any) followed by stage-number of zeros then stage-number of ones. The sequence is all stages read sequentially as rows. See PARI program for comments about stage lengths and cumulative lengths.
%C A209355 For each positive integer n each term appears in runs of length exactly n infinitely often. This sequence's construction process, which can clearly be generalized for any (finite) number of distinct terms, has A079813 as the limit of its n-th stage as n --> infinity.

%e A209355 Terms a(15) through a(17) are the first run (of infinitely many such runs) of exactly three zeros.
