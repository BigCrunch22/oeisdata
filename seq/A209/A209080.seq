%N A209080 Number of chess diagrams that can be obtained in exactly one way in n plies and cannot be obtained in fewer plies. This is also the number of dual-free shortest proof games in n plies.
%C A209080 Chess diagrams are chess positions without regard to whether castling or en passant capturing is possible. They are counted in A019319. A shortest proof game (SPG) is a classic type of chess problem. Most published SPGs are dual-free (have only one solution), which is why we count diagrams that are obtained in exactly one way in the minimum number of plies.
