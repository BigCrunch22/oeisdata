%N A209916 Kolmogorov's button, 2-color generic convex polygon version.
%C A209916 This sequence shows the number of distinct patterns that can be created with threads of 2 colors while sewing on a button with n buttonholes located on the vertices of a generic convex n-gon, i.e., a convex n-gon with no more than two diagonals intersecting at any point in its interior. The number of all distinct patterns due to intersections made by differently colored diagonals of the n-gon, equaling 2^A000332(n), is taken into account (as red-diagonal-over-green-diagonal, for instance, is a different pattern from green-diagonal-over-red-diagonal). In general, if the number of colors is c, then a(n) = ((c+1)^(n-1)*n/2)*((c-1)*c)^A000332(n)-1.
%C A209916 Kolmogorov's button problem is briefly mentioned in the book by Gessen.

%F A209916 a(n) = A047656(n)*2^A000332(n) - 1.
%e A209916 For the classic 4-hole button (where n=4 and c=2) the number of distinct patterns is a(n) = A047656(4)*2^A000332(4) - 1 = 729*2 - 1 = 1457. The "-1" stands for the case where the threads are missing, i.e., where the button is unattached to the cloth.
