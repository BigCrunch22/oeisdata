%N A209920 Numbers n having distinct parity as the number of partitions of n.
%C A209920 Odd positive integers with an even number of partitions and nonnegative even integers with an odd number of partitions. Union of A163097 and A163096. Note that the union of A067567 and A127219 gives A194798 and the union of A194798 and this sequence gives A001477.

%e A209920 4 is in the sequence because the number of partitions of 4 is equal to 5 and the parity of 4 is distinct to the parity of 5 because 4 is even and 5 is odd.
%e A209920 9 is in the sequence because the number of partitions of 9 is equal to 30 and the parity of 9 is distinct to the parity of 30 because 9 is odd and 30 is even.
%Y A209920 Complement of A194798.
