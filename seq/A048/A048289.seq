%N A048289 Number of Go games with exactly n moves.
%C A048289 The sequence seems based on the assumption that the game starts with an empty 19 X 19 board, which is not necessarily the case in an official Go tournament. After any of the 361 = 19^2 choices for the first move, the opponent has 19^2-1 choices for placing his stone, so the value a(2) = 361^2 = 361*(361-1 + 1) takes into account the possibility of not placing a stone. A detailed account of the precise rules used here would be useful to make the definition of this sequence complete. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 22 2016
