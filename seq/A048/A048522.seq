%e A048522 To generate the sequence, start with a 1. There is one 1, so the sequence becomes 11. Now there are 2 1s, but 2 is 0 mod 2, so it becomes 01. Then we get 1011, 111001, 110011, 010001, and so on. The terms in the series are these numbers converted to base 10. Note that leading zeros are not discarded during this process! - _William K.
