%N A364213 The number of trailing 0's in the canonical representation of n as a sum of distinct Jacobsthal numbers (A280049).
%C A364213 The even terms of A007583.
%C A364213 This sequence is unbounded. The first position of 2*k is A007583(k) = (2^(2*k+1) + 1)/3.
%C A364213 The asymptotic density of the occurrences of (2*k) in this sequence is 3/4^(k+1).
%C A364213 The asymptotic mean of this sequence is 2/3 and its asymptotic standard deviation is 4/3.
