%N A364057 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of positive integers such that any subsequence {a(j), a(j+k), a(j+2k)} (for any j and k) is unique.
%C A364057 To find a(n), two criteria must be satisfied:
%C A364057 1. Every subsequence {a(n-2m), a(n-m) a(n)} created by a(n) must be unique.
%C A364057 2. a(n) cannot create the scenario where a future a(m) will create multiple {a(m-2k), a(m-k), a(m)} regardless of choice for a(m). The first time this is the sole reason a candidate is denied is at a(10), see Example below.
%C A364057 Will every subsequence of 3 positive integers appear in arithmetic progression in this sequence?
%C A364057 Will every positive integer occur infinitely many times?
%C A364057 After a(3), a(n) != a(n+1).

%e A364057 For a(9), we first try 1. If a(9) were 1, {a(3), a(6), a(9)} would be {1, 1, 1}, but this already occurred at {a(1), a(2), a(3)}.
%e A364057 Next, try 2. If a(9) were 2, {a(3), a(6), a(9)} would be {1, 1, 2}, but this already occurred at {a(2), a(3), a(4)}.
%e A364057 Next, try 3. If a(9) were 3, {a(3), a(6), a(9)} would be {1, 1, 3}, but this already occurred at {a(1), a(3), a(5)}.
%e A364057 Next, try 4. If a(9) were 4, {a(1), a(5), a(9)} would be {1, 3, 4}, but this already occurred at {a(2), a(5), a(8)}.
%e A364057 Then, try 5. New subsequences at indices {a(1), a(5), a(9)} = {1, 3, 5}, {a(3), a(6), a(9)} = {1, 1, 5}, {a(5), a(7), a(9)} = {3, 2, 5}, and {a(7), a(8), a(9)} = {2, 4, 5} are formed, none of which have occurred at any {a(j), a(j+k), a(j+2k)} (for any j and k) previously. No 5 has occurred previously, so criteria (2) in Comments must be satisfied. Thus a(9) = 5.
%e A364057 a(10) is the first time a candidate is denied solely because it would create a guaranteed future duplicate. Note that no subsequences prevent a(10) from being 4.
%e A364057 n    = 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14

%e A364057                       |           |           |
%e A364057           |                 |                 |
%e A364057 If a(10) were 4, {a(2), a(8), a(14)} = {a(6), a(10), a(14)} = {1, 4, X}, making a subsequence {a(j), a(j+k), a(j+2k)} which is not unique. Therefore a(10) != 4.
