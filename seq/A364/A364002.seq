%N A364002 The chromatic number of the Euclidean distance graph G(Z^3, sqrt(n)).
%C A364002 Let d be equal to the square root of a positive integer n.  The graph G(Z^3, d) has its set of vertices being the 3-dimensional integer lattice Z^3.  Two vertices are adjacent if and only if they are a Euclidean distance d apart.  The chromatic number of G(Z^3, d) is equal to the minimum number of colors needed to color Z^3 so that no two points distance d apart receive the same color.  Note that this chromatic number is 1 when d is not realized as a distance between points of Z^3.
%C A364002 The known values of this sequence come from results (or corollaries of results) in the papers linked below.  At present, it appears that this chromatic number is only unknown when each of the following holds for the integer n:  (1) the squarefree part of n is even, (2) the squarefree part of n has at least one odd prime factor congruent to 2 modulo 3, (3) n is congruent to 2 modulo 3.
