%N A364936 a(n) = minimum number of variables with n possible states in a system such that its solution requires the processing of a transcomputational number of bits.
%C A364936 The number 10^93, known as Bremermann's limit, is the estimated maximum number of bits able to be processed by a hypothetical Earth-sized computer in a period of time equal to the rough estimate of the Earth's age. All numbers greater than Bremermann's limit are labeled as "transcomputational."

%F A364936 a(n) = ceiling(93*log(10)/log(n)).
%e A364936 For k = 2 (i.e., a set of n Boolean variables), 309 is the corresponding term of this sequence as it is the smallest integer which satisfies 10^93 < 2^n.
