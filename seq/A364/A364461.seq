%N A364461 Positive integers such that if prime(a)*prime(b) is a divisor, prime(a+b) is not.
%C A364461 Also Heinz numbers of a type of sum-free partitions not allowing re-used parts, counted by A236912.
%e A364461 The prime indices of 198 are {1,2,2,5}, which is sum-free even though it is not knapsack (A299702, A299729), so 198 is in the sequence.
%t A364461 prix[n_]:=If[n==1,{}, Flatten[Cases[FactorInteger[n], {p_,k_}:>Table[PrimePi[p],{k}]]]];
%t A364461 Select[Range[100],Intersection[prix[#], Total/@Subsets[prix[#],{2}]]=={}&]
%Y A364461 Subsets of this type are counted by A085489, with re-usable parts A007865.
%Y A364461 Subsets not of this type are counted by A093971, w/ re-usable parts A088809.
%Y A364461 Partitions of this type are counted by A236912.
%Y A364461 Allowing parts to be re-used gives A364347, counted by A364345.
%Y A364461 The complement allowing parts to be re-used is A364348, counted by A363225.
%Y A364461 The non-binary version allowing re-used parts is counted by A364350.
%Y A364461 The complement is A364462, counted by A237113.
%Y A364461 The non-binary version is A364531, counted by A237667, complement A364532.
%Y A364461 A001222 counts prime indices.
%Y A364461 A108917 counts knapsack partitions, ranks A299702.
%Y A364461 A112798 lists prime indices, sum A056239.
