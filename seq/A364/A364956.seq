%N A364956 Numbers k such that A163511(k) is either k itself or its descendant in Doudna-tree, A005940 (or equally, in A163511-tree).
%C A364956 Numbers k such that A252464(k) = A364954(k), where A364954(n) is the length of the common prefix in the binary expansions of A156552(n) and A156552(A163511(n)).
%e A364956 For n = 341887, A156552(n) = 1736, "11011001000" in binary, and A163511(n) = 1830711541, with A156552(A163511(n)) = 444544, "1101100100010000000" in binary, and as the former binary expansion is a prefix of the latter, 341887 is included in this sequence. In this case, 1830711541 = A003961^7(2*341887), where A003961^7 indicates a prime shift by seven steps towards larger primes.
%e A364956 For n = 683774 = 2*341887, A156552(n) = 3473 = "110110010001", and A163511(n) = 3661423082 = 2*1830711541, with A156552(A163511(n)) = 889089, "11011001000100000001", and as the former binary expansion is a prefix of the latter, 683774 is included in this sequence.
