%N A364451 a(n) is the number of trees of diameter 4 with n vertices that are N-games in peg duotaire.
%C A364451 Peg duotaire is an impartial normal-play two-player game played on a simple graph, in which each vertex starts with a peg in it. If all vertices have a peg (i.e. the first turn), a move consists of removing some peg from a vertex.
%C A364451 If some vertex does not have a peg, then a move hops one peg over another, landing in an adjacent hole and removing the jumped peg. Formally, it is three vertices x, y, z where x, y are adjacent and y, z are adjacent, and x, y have pegs and z does not. After the move, x, y do not have pegs and z does.
%C A364451 Note than this sequence is always less than or equal to the number of trees of diameter 4 with n vertices, see A000094.

%F A364451 a(n) <= A000094(n).
%e A364451 There is only one tree of diameter 4 with 5 vertices. It is an N-game, as evidenced by the below winning strategy for the first player. We use 1 to represent a vertex with a peg and 0 otherwise.
