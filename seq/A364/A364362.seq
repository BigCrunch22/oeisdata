%N A364362 Consider all the ways to make sequences of distinct nonnegative integers using all the digits of n, such that no term has leading 0's or appears more than once in the sequence. a(n) is the minimum possible sum of any sequence of n.
%C A364362 Leading 0's are not permitted on any of the terms of the sequences of n. None of the terms are allowed to repeat in a given sequence of n.
%C A364362 Note, this sequence is the same as A331472 until n >= 100.
%e A364362 For n = 101, the following sequences can be made:
%e A364362   1-term sequences: {101}, {110};
%e A364362   2-term sequences: {10, 1}, {11, 0}, {1, 10}, {0, 11}.
%e A364362 Their sums are 101, 110, 10+1=11, 11+0=11, 1+10=11, and 0+11=11, respectively; the minimum sum is 11, so a(101) = 11.
