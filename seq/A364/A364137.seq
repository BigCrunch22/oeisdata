%N A364137 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest positive number such that the sum of all terms a(1) + ... + a(n) has the same number of distinct prime factors as the product of all terms a(1) * ... * a(n).
%C A364137 The terms magnitudes show different regimes, ever increasing in average size, as a new prime factor appears in the product of all terms. In the first 5000 terms an increase in the total number of distinct prime factors of this product occurs at n = 2, 12, 127, 465, 801, 1230, 2798. After a(2798) = 1020 the sum of all terms is 881790 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 13 * 17 * 19 which contains seven distinct prime factors, while the product of all terms is 31155...000 (a number containing 5264 digits) that equals 2^4398 * 3^2902 * 5^1607 * 7^980 * 11^312 * 13^249 * 17, which also contains seven distinct prime factors. See the graph of the terms.
%C A364137 In the first 5000 terms the smallest numbers not to have appeared are 11,13,17,19,23,29,31,33,34. It is unknown if all numbers eventually appear.

%e A364137 a(2) = 2 as a(1) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 while a(1) * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2, both of which have one distinct prime factor.
%e A364137 a(3) = 1 as a(1) + a(2) + 1 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 while a(1) * a(2) * 1 = 1 * 2 * 1 = 2, both of which have one distinct prime factor.
%e A364137 a(12) = 3 as a(1) + ... a(11) + 3 = 1 + ... + 2 + 3 = 22 while a(1) * ... a(11) * 3 = 1 * ... * 2 * 3 = 192, both of which have two distinct prime factors.
