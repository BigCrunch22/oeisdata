%N A364138 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not yet appeared such that the sum of all terms a(1) + ... + a(n) has the same number of distinct prime factors as the product of all terms a(1) * ... * a(n).
%C A364138 The terms magnitudes show different regimes, ever increasing in average size, as a new prime factor appears in the product of all terms. In the first 1000 terms an increase in the total number of distinct prime factors of this product occurs at n = 2, 3, 9, 22, 56, 159, 385, 714. After a(714) = 118404 the sum of all terms is 11741730 =  2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 * 13 * 17 * 23 which contains eight distinct prime factors, while the product of all terms is 11122...000 (a number containing 2585 digits) that equals 2^1738 * 3^1136 * 5^664 * 7^486 * 11^299 * 13^237 * 23 * 29^46, which also contains eight distinct prime factors. See the graph of the terms.
%C A364138 In the first 1000 terms the smallest numbers not to have appeared are 5,11,13,14,17,19,23,26,29. It is unknown if all numbers eventually appear.

%e A364138 a(2) = 2 as 2 has not previously appeared and a(1) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 while a(1) * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2, both of which have one distinct prime factor.
%e A364138 a(3) = 3 as 3 has not previously appeared and a(1) + a(2) + 3 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 while a(1) * a(2) * 3 = 1 * 2 * 3 = 6, both of which have two distinct prime factors.
%e A364138 a(9) = 15 as 15 has not previously appeared and a(1) + ... a(8) + 15 = 1 + ... + 12 + 15 = 60 while a(1) * ... a(8) * 15 = 1 * ... * 12 * 15 = 1866240, both of which have three distinct prime factors.
