%N A364882 a(1)=1 and thereafter a(n) is the number of locations 1..n-1 which are visited last in a single path beginning at some location s, in which one proceeds from location i to i +- a(i) (within 1..n-1) until no further unvisited location is available.
%C A364882 A location can be visited no more than once in a single path.
%e A364882 a(9)=6 because there are 6 locations which can be visited last (as a dead end) among i=1..8. The 6 locations are i=1,2,3,5,7,8. The following shows a path in which the last location is i=5, beginning at location s=8:
%e A364882   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   location number i
%e A364882   1,1,2,3,3,3,3,4   a(i)
%e A364882   1<----3<------4
%e A364882   1>1>2-->3
%e A364882 From i=5, the only jumps are back to i=1 or forward to i=8, both of which were already visited, so i=5 is one possible dead end term. Here is a path illustrating how i=7 can be a dead end term. We begin at s=4.
%e A364882   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8   location number i
%e A364882   1,1,2,3,3,3,3,4   a(i)
%e A364882         3---->3
%e A364882 From i=7, we can only jump back to i=4, which was already visited, so i=7 is a dead end term. There are 4 other locations which can be last (or dead ends), for a total of 6 such locations, so a(9)=6.
