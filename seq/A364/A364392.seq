%N A364392 a(1)=1 and thereafter a(n) is the least number of locations 1..n-1 which can be visited in a single path beginning at i=n-1, in which one proceeds from location i to i +- a(i) (within 1..n-1) until no further unvisited location is available.
%e A364392 a(13)=3 because beginning at the most recent location i=n-1=12, where a(12)=6, we can visit (the fewest possible) 3 locations in a single path as follows:
%e A364392   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12   location number i
%e A364392   1,1,2,3,4,4,3,6,3, 4, 4, 6   a(i)
%e A364392             <--------------6
%e A364392             4-------->
%e A364392 At i=10, the only jump is back to 10-a(10) = 6, which was already visited, so the path stops.
