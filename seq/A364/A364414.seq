%e A364414 Its second part is an octagon of width 1 and one of its vertices is also the central vertex of the first valley of the largest Dyck path of the structure, so 21 is in the sequence.
%e A364414 Note that 10 is not in the sequence because the second part of the symmetric representation of sigma(10) is an octagon of width 1 in accordance with the definition but none of its vertices is the central vertex of the first valley of the largest Dyck path of the diagram.
