%N A364236 a(1) = 1. For n > 1, if a(n-1) is a novel term, a(n) = d(a(n-1)), else if a(n-1) is a repeat term seen k (>1) times, a(n) = a(n-1) + d(k-1), where d is the divisor counting function A000005.
%C A364236 In other words the appearance of a novel term m introduces d(m) as next term, whereas the appearance of repeat term m introduces m + the number of divisors of the number of repetitions of m.
%C A364236 1 is seen only twice, but all other numbers appear infinitely many times.
%C A364236 Prime terms may appear in 3 different ways: consequent to the second appearance of p-1, to the first appearance of m where d(m) = p, or to a repeat term m seen k (>1) times, where m + d(k-1) = p.
%C A364236 The plot consists of consecutive strictly increasing trajectories starting d(r(k)) after the k_th record term r(k), and ending with r(k+1) = r(k)+1, meaning that records are given by A000027. This behavior, which determines the smooth whaleback shape of the plot is open to explanation.

%e A364236 a(1) = 1 is a novel term so a(2) = d(a(1)) = d(1) = 1.
%e A364236 Since 1 has been repeated once, a(3) = 1 + d(1) = 2.
%e A364236 a(3) = 2 introduces a(4) = d(2) = 2 and so on.
