%N A364433 Numbers with multiplicities of primes per mod 3 residue in nonincreasing order.
%C A364433 Terms of A364583 are in this sequence.
%e A364433 60 = 2^2 * 3 * 5 is in the sequence as the prime factors with residue 2 (mod 3) are 2 and 5 and they have multiplicities 2 and 1 respectively. Those multiplicities are nonincreasing. Primes with residue 0 (mod 3) are 3 which have multiplicity 1. There are no prime factors with residue 1 (mod 3). So the multiplicities of all prime factors are nonincreasing for each residue mod 3.
%o A364433 (PARI) is(n) = my(es=vector(3, i, oo)); forprime(p=2, oo, v = valuation(n,p); if(es[p%3+1]>=v, es[p%3+1]=v, return(0)); n/=p^v; if(n==1,return(1)))
