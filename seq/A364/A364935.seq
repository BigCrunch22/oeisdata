%N A364935 a(1) = 1 and thereafter a(n) = sum of digits of the number from concatenation of a(n-1) on the left with leftmost digit of a(n-1) + k and concatenation on the right with rightmost digit of a(n-1) + k, where k is the number of times a(n-1) has appeared in the sequence.
%C A364935 Empirical observations: this sequence is extremely slow to grow, but I believe it diverges; the mode M(n) grows slowly and after some initial stabilization increases in intervals of 2; the distribution of even numbers in the limit follows a Gaussian distribution, and the distribution of odd numbers in the limits follows its *own* smaller Gaussian distribution.
%C A364935 The graph of the first 100000 terms looks somewhat like that 90's Jazz design that was on cups and other items, with a darker band concentrated in the middle of thick, diffuse swooshes.

%e A364935 For n=2, a(1) = 1 and "1" has appeared once (k=1) in the sequence. We add 1 to the leftmost digit, 1, and the rightmost digit, 1, and concatenate on each side so 212 which has sum of digits a(2) = 5.
%e A364935 For n=3, similarly a(2)=5 has appeared once (1) so we add 1 to the leftmost digit, 5, and the rightmost digit, 5, so 656 and its sum of digits is a(3) = 17.
%e A364935 For n=4, 17 -> 2178 -> 18, a(4) = 18.
