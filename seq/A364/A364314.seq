%N A364314 Number of polynomials (with nonnegative coefficients) of Cantor's height n and degree k (in the range {1, 2, ..., n-1}), for n >= 2; and for n = 1 the degree is k = 1.
%C A364314 For details on the recorded integer polynomials and their coefficients see A364312.
%e A364314 a(3) = 3 because the coefficients in A364312 are [2, 1], [1, 2], for
%e A364314  degree k = 1, and [1, 0, 1], for degree k = 2, and the three polynomials are 2*x + 1, x + 2, and x^2 + 1.
%e A364314 For the counting of algebraic numbers one also has to use the signed versions with leading sign +, and consider only irreducible polynomials. Therefore, if only real algebraic numbers are considered, [1, 0, 1] does not qualify, because it leads to a pair of complex conjugate roots, and the signed version [1, 0, -1] gives a reducible polynomial.
