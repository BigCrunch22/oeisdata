%N A364139 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest positive number such that the sum of all terms a(1) + ... + a(n) has the same number of prime factors, counted with multiplicity, as the product of all terms a(1) * ... * a(n).
%C A364139 Other than a(2) = a(4) = 2, it is unknown if more terms appear with the same value, or if all numbers eventually appear.
%e A364139 a(2) = 2 as a(1) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 while a(1) * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2, both of which have one prime factor.
%e A364139 a(3) = 3 as a(1) + a(2) + 4 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 = 2 * 3 while a(1) * a(2) * 3 = 1 * 2 * 3 = 6 = 2 * 3, both of which have two prime factors.
%e A364139 a(4) = 2 as a(1) + a(2) + a(3) + 2 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 = 8 = 2^3, while a(1) * a(2) * a(3) * 2 = 1 * 2 * 3 * 2 = 12 = 2^2 * 3, both of which have three prime factors.
%e A364139 a(13) = 5412938 as a(1) + ... + a(12) + 5412938 = 2329935872 = 2^21 * 11 * 101, while a(1) * ... * a(12) * 5412938 = 2986...7200 = 2^9 * 3^2 * 5^2 * 11 * 23 * 73 * 139 * 1231 * 19471 * 113213 * 36661237 * 92464579 * 1097634779, both of which have twenty-three prime factors.
