%N A364489 Values of n for which the Sprague-Grundy value of Heat-Charge Toggle on an (n+2)-vertex path with initial weights -1,1^n,-1 is evil for odd n or odious for even n.
%C A364489 Heat-Charge Toggle is an impartial two-player game on a finite simple graph, where each vertex is assigned a weight of -1, 0, or 1.
%C A364489 A Heat-Charge Toggle move consists of selecting a vertex of weight 1 and switching its weight to 0, as well as switching the sign of each of its neighbors: changing 1 to -1, -1 to 1, and keeping 0 at 0.
%C A364489 We additionally only allow moves that strictly decrease the sum of all weights.
%C A364489 The two vertices of degree one have initial weights of -1, while vertices of degree two have an initial weight of 1.

%e A364489 For n = 4, the Sprague-Grundy value for a 6-vertex path is 2.
%e A364489 Note that n = 4 is even and 2 is odious (see A000069).
