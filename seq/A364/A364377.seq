%N A364377 The number of trailing 0's in the representation of n in Jacobsthal greedy base (A265747).
%C A364377 The first position of k, for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., is A001045(k+2).
%C A364377 The asymptotic density of the occurrences of 2*k is 9/4^(k+2), and of 2*k+1 is 3/4^(k+2), both for k >= 0.
%C A364377 The asymptotic mean of this sequence is 11/12, and its asymptotic standard deviation is sqrt(283)/12.
