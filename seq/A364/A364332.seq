%N A364332 a(n) = f(prime(n)), where f(2)=0 and for an odd prime p,  f(p) = max{a(q)+1: q ranges over all prime factors of p-1}.
%C A364332 This sequence is related to a problem about googology (see Zhihu).
%C A364332 There are three numbers named A, B and C, and initially A>1, and B=C=0.
%C A364332 Now take the following steps:
%C A364332   Step 1. Let B=B+1, C=C+1.
%C A364332   Step 2. Check if A is divisible by (B+1). If yes, go to Step 3; if no, go back to Step 1.
%C A364332   Step 3. Let A=A/(B+1)*B^C.
%C A364332   Step 4. Let B=0.
%C A364332   Step 5. If A=1, then stop, otherwise go back to Step 1.
%C A364332 This program will always stop. When the program stops, C will be a very large number.
%C A364332 When Step 3 reached, B+1 will be the smallest prime factor of A, and this factor is eliminated while some smaller factors; i.e., factors of B, are added.
%C A364332 The properties of this problem rely on the prime factors of A. A can be described by the ordinal: O(A) = n_(k-1)*omega^(l_(k-1)) + ... + n_2*omega^(l_2) + n_1*omega^(l_1) + n_0 where A = 2^(n_0) * 3^(n_1) * 5^(n_2) * p(k)^(n_(k-1)). Every operation will monotonically decrease the ordinal.
%C A364332 Note that the exponential of omega in each term is l_k instead of k, and this is because the correspondence between prime factors and powers of omega is more complicated than "p(k+1) to omega^k".
%C A364332 When B+1=2, the increase of C is only 1, then every prime factor 2 corresponds ordinal 1, or omega^0. This agrees with a(p)=0 when p=2 in this sequence.
%C A364332 When B+1=3, any number of exponential of 2 can be increased, then every prime factor 3 corresponds ordinal omega.
%C A364332 When B+1=5, only the power of 2 can be increased as well, then prime factor 5 also corresponds omega.
%C A364332 When B+1=7, any number of exponentials of 2 and 3 can be both increased, then the corresponding ordinal is (1+omega)*omega=omega*omega=omega^2.
%C A364332 The rule is, the power of omega for a given prime number p equals the maximum among those for prime factors of (p-1), plus one.
%C A364332 This sequence is similar to but different from A083647, the difference begins at the 52nd term; i.e. for p=239. That is because 238=2*7*17 and a(7)=3>2=a(17) although 7<17.

%F A364332 f(2) = 0 and f(p) = max{f(q):q is prime and q|(p-1)}+1 for p an odd prime. Then a(n) = f(prime(n)).
%e A364332 For p=443, 442=2*13*17, and f(2)=0, f(13)=2, f(17)=1.
%e A364332 The maximum among them is 2, so f(443)=3, or a(86)=3.
