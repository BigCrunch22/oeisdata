%N A364164 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not yet appeared that has the same number of distinct prime factors as the sum of all previous terms.
%C A364164 In the first 20000 terms the largest value is a(14889) = 15825810 which contains eight distinct prime factors. In the same range there are 593 terms that are prime, the last being a(19985) = 4339, while the smallest number not to appear is 4349. It is likely all numbers eventually appear.

%e A364164 a(3) = 3 as the sum of all previous terms is 1 + 2 = 3 which contains one distinct prime factor, and 3 is the smallest unused number that also contains one distinct prime factor.
%e A364164 a(6) = 12 as the sum of all previous terms is 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 10 = 22 which contains two distinct prime factors, and 12 is the smallest unused number that also contains two distinct prime factors.
