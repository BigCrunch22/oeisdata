%N A364874 A packing coloring for the one-way infinite path using only the first 8 prime numbers.
%C A364874 a(1)=2; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest number in the set S = {2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19}, subject to the constraint that for m < n, if a(m) = a(n) = s_i, n-m > s_i.
%C A364874 Observations:
%C A364874 The sequence is eventually periodic after the 129th term, with the repetend being the last 54 terms provided above. The repetend itself, repeated periodically, is also a packing coloring for the one-way and two-way infinite paths using this set S.
%C A364874 The chromatic number for packing the two-way infinite path with primes may be 8.
