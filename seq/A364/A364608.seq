%N A364608 Smallest k such that there are as many 0's as 1's in the binary representation of (2*n+1)^k, or -1 if no such k exists.
%C A364608 a(n) is the smallest k such that (2*n+1)^k is in A031443.
%C A364608 Conjecture: a(n) != -1 for all n.
%C A364608 For even m, the proportion of 1's in the binary representation of m^k conjecturally converges to less than 1/2, so unless the numbers of 0's and 1's are equal for some small k, it is likely that no such k exists. For m = 2, 6, 10, 12, 14, 38, 42, 44, 46, ... there do exist such small k = 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 5, ..., respectively.
%e A364608 For n = 2, (2*n+1)^k = 5^k in binary is 101, 11001, 1111101, 1001110001 for k = 1, 2, 3, 4. Only the last of these has as many 0's as 1's, so a(2) = 4.
