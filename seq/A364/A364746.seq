%N A364746 Irregular triangle read by rows T(n,k), n >= 1, 1 <= k <= A002378(n), which is mentioned in the conjecture of A364639 (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A364746 It is conjectured that 1 together with infinitely many copies of the n-th row gives the n-th column of the triangle A364639.
%C A364746 Row n has n blocks and every block has n + 1 terms.
%C A364746 In the n-th row its m-th block lists n - m zeros, 1, m - 1 zeros, and the last term of the block is -1 except in the n-th block, in which the last term is zero, with 1 <= m <= n.
%C A364746 Thus in the n-th row the number of -1's is equal to n - 1, the number of zeros is equal to A002061(n) and the number of 1's is equal to n.
