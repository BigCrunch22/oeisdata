%N A231610 The least k such that the Collatz (3x+1) iteration of k contains 2^n as the largest power of 2.
%C A231610 Very similar to A225124, where 2^n is the largest number in the Collatz iteration of A225124(n). The only difference appears to be a(8), which is 75 here and 85 in A225124. The Collatz iteration of 75 is {75, 226, 113, 340, 170, 85, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1}.
%F A231610 a(n) = 2^n for odd n.
%e A231610 The iteration for 21 is {21, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1}, which shows that 64 = 2^6 is a term. However, 32 is not the first power of two. We have to wait until the iteration for 32, which is {32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1}, to see 32 = 2^5 as the first power of two.
%t A231610 Collatz[n_?OddQ] := 3*n + 1; Collatz[n_?EvenQ] := n/2; nn = 21; t = Table[-1, {nn}]; n = 0; cnt = 0; While[cnt < nn, n++; q = Log[2, NestWhile[Collatz, n, Not[IntegerQ[Log[2, #]]] &]]; If[q < nn && t[[q + 1]] == -1, t[[q + 1]] = n; cnt++]]; t
%Y A231610 Cf. A010120, A054646 (similar sequences).
