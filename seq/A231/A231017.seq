%N A231017 Least prime q > p = prime(n) such that if d = q-p, then p, p+d, p+2d, ..., p+(p-1)d are all primes.
%C A231017 Second term in the smallest non-constant p-term arithmetic progression (AP) of primes beginning with p = prime(n).
%C A231017 For any non-constant AP beginning with a prime p and ending with a prime, the maximum possible length is p, since p+pd is not prime for d > 0. If all the terms are prime, then the common difference d must be a multiple of all primes < p.
%C A231017 Ribenboim says that in 1986 G. Loh [Loeh] discovered a(5) and a(6), and that a(n) should exist for all n, but "in my opinion, this is so difficult that no one will prove [it], and no one will find a counterexample in the near future."
%C A231017 Phil Carmody found a(7) in 2001.

%F A231017 a(n) = prime(n) + A088430(n) = prime(n) + A002110(n)*A231018(n).
%e A231017 Prime(3) = 5 and 5, 11, 17, 23, 29 is the smallest 5-term AP beginning with 5, so a(3) = 11.
