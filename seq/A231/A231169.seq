%N A231169 Triangle read by rows: T[i,j] = number of (distinct) letters which the English names of i and j have in common; j=0,...,i ; i=0,1,2,...
%C A231169 This uses American English: no additional "and", i.e., "one hunded one", and short scale (10^9 = billion). Spaces and hyphens are ignored.
%C A231169 The diagonal yields the number of distinct letters in the (American) English name of the numbers (not A005589, which counts letters with multiplicity, or A052360 which even counts hyphens and spaces).
%C A231169 All numbers beyond 911 share at least one letter with any other number, except for 2000 and 2002 which don't share a letter with five. See A227857(n) for the number of numbers which have no letter in common with n.
