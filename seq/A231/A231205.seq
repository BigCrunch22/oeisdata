%N A231205 Table of maximal number of guesses required to solve a Mastermind variant, read by columns.
%C A231205 The table is the maximum number of guesses required to absolutely identify a code from n colored pegs in k slots with no repetition, where marking is ordered and uses 3 types of peg - gray indicating the color isn't present, white indicating the color is present but in the wrong position and black indicating the color is present and in the right position.
%C A231205 Ordered marking means the codemaker marks from left to right and places a marking peg in the corresponding slot in the answer grid.
%C A231205 Note that the sequence only gives the number of guesses required, not the number of turns required. If for example we have 2 colors and 2 slots, and we guess RG and get marked ww, we now know the answer is GR, and this is not counted as necessary to guess.
%C A231205 T(3,2)=1 because with 3 colors, say c1, c2 and c3, then any answer to, say, the guess c1|c2 tells you the answer - if it's ww the answer is c2|c1, bb -> c1|c2, gw -> c2|c3, wg -> c3|c1, gb -> c3|c2 and bg -> c1|c3. The answers bw, wb and gg are all impossible.
%C A231205 T(4,3)=2 because the worst case scenario involves the 1st guess returning www or some form of wwg.
