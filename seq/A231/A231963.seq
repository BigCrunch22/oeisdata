%N A231963 Concatenate n with its UPC check digit, a(n) = 10*n + A237042(n).
%C A231963 Theoretically, a UPC check digit can be used with 1- or 2-digit numbers as well as numbers with more than 17 digits. There is probably no practical need for the former, while the latter would probably require a more robust error-detecting (if not error-correcting) mechanism.
%C A231963 However, the UPC check digit is a more robust mechanism than a simple digital root would be, as it guards against dyslexia when a seemingly scannable UPC code does not scan and the human operator has to type in the code (whether a cash register or a mobile scanner).
%C A231963 This is because to generate the check digit, the digits in the one's place, hundred's place, ten hundred's place, etc., are multiplied by 3. Thus, for example, 13 gives 0 for a check digit while 31 gives 4 for a check digit.
%C A231963 Some manufacturers that have or might have UPCs ending in the numbers shown above include H. J. Heinz (013000) and the Hershey Company (068000).
%C A231963 As a rule of thumb, the terms mostly advance in steps of 7, sometimes 17.

%F A231963 a(n) = 10n + c(n), where c(n) = A237042(n) = -( (Sum_{i=1..floor(L/2)} d(2i-1)) + 3*(Sum_{j=0..floor(L/2)} d(2j)) ) mod 10, where L is how many digits n has, d(L - 1) is the most significant digit of n, ..., and d(0) is the one's place digit.
%e A231963 a(13) = 130 because 1 * 1 + 3 * 3 = 10, giving a check digit of 0.
%e A231963 a(14) = 147 because 1 * 1 + 4 * 3 = 13, and -13 = 7 mod 10.
%e A231963 a(15) = 154 because 1 * 1 + 5 * 3 = 16, and -16 = 4 mod 10.
