%N A231614 Numbers n such that the five eighth-degree cyclotomic polynomials are simultaneously prime.
%C A231614 The polynomials are cyclotomic(15,x) = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 + x^7 + x^8, cyclotomic(16,x) = 1 + x^8, cyclotomic(20,x) = 1 - x^2 + x^4 - x^6 + x^8, cyclotomic(24,x) = 1 - x^4 + x^8, and cyclotomic(30,x) = 1 + x - x^3 - x^4 - x^5 + x^7 + x^8. The numbers 15, 16, 20, 24 and 30 are in the eighth row of A032447.
%C A231614 By Schinzel's hypothesis H, there are an infinite number of n that yield simultaneous primes. Note that the two first-degree cyclotomic polynomials, x-1 and x+1, yield the twin primes for the numbers in A014574.
%D A231614 See A087277.
