%C A231717 For all n, a(A226061(n+1)) = A232095(n). This works because at the positions given by each x=A226061(n+1), it holds that A219666(x) = (n+1)!-1, which has a factorial base representation (A007623) of (n,n-1,n-2,...,3,2,1) whose digit sum (A034968) is the n-th triangular number, A000217(n). This in turn is always a new record as at those points, in each significant digit position so far employed, a maximal digit value (for factorial number system) is used, and thus the preceding term, A219666(x-1) cannot have any larger digits in its factorial base representation, and so the differences between their digits (in matching positions) are all nonnegative.
