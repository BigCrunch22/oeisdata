%e A231206 The first a(1) = 2 terms yield the prime 23. The next a(2) = 3 terms yield the prime 149, etc.: We see that the terms satisfy the requirement of yielding primes by concatenating the first a(1) terms, then the next a(2) terms, then the next a(3) terms of the sequence, etc. But what about minimality?
%e A231206 The first term can't be 1 since that would mean that taking one single term, i.e., that 1, one would get a prime.
%e A231206 But a(1) = 2 is possible without contradiction, as we can see, so that is the least possible choice and therefore by definition the first term a(1).
%e A231206 Now we can't choose 1 for a(2), which would not yield a prime (as concatenation of the first a(1) = 2 terms a(1) and a(2), which would then be 21 = 3*7). The number 2 also isn't possible for a(2), since already used for a(1). However, a(2) = 3 is possible. Then a(3) = 1 and a(4) = 4 (the least numbers not yet used) don't lead to contradictions, although we must keep in mind that choosing a(3) = 1 means that the next term after a(5) must be a prime on its own. Since concatenation of the a(2) = 3 terms a(3..5) must be prime, the next term a(5) cannot be 5, 6, 7 or 8, but a(5) = 9 is possible. And so on.
