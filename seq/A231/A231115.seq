%N A231115 Start with 1; then a(n+1) = concatenation of c(d) and d*c(d), where d is the last digit of a(n) and the counter c(d) is increased at each occurrence of d, and once more if d*c(d) would end in zero.
%C A231115 The resulting sequence shows the multiplications that have been done, where the "," becomes the multiplication operator. E.g., ...,312,48,... shows that at this point the digit '2' occurred for the 4th time and the calculation was 2*4=8. At the next occurrence one would get 2 x 5 = 10 which is forbidden, so the counter is set to 6, which yields the 432,612 <=> 2*6=12.
