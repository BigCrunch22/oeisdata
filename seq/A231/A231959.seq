%N A231959 Numbers n dividing the Lucas sequence u(n) defined by u(i) = 3*u(i-1) - u(i-2) with initial conditions u(0)=0, u(1)=1.
%C A231959 All terms except 1 are divisible by either 5 or 6. The sequence contains every nonnegative integer power of 5. There are infinitely many multiples of 6 in the sequence and infinitely many consecutive integers in the sequence (for example, 5,6 or 24,25, or 54,55).
