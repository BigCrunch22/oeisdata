%C A231072 From a(101) on it must be made precise that this sequence uses the American style ("one hundred one"), as in A052360, and not the British style ("one hundred and one"). The choice of long or short scale does not make a difference since, e.g., the word "milliard" in long scale use would simply be replaced by "billion" in short scale. However, the use of "thousand [million]" instead, would lead to different results for numbers such that floor(n/10^6) mod 10^3 is zero. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 03 2013

%e A231072 From "zero" to "twenty", the numbers are written in one word, so a(0..20)=1. "Twenty-one" is the first term to require 2 words, so a(21)=2.
%o A231072 (PARI) a(n)=sum(k=7,#n=Vecsmall(English(n)),n[k-3]<65)+1 \\ See A052360 for English(). Only characters 4,...,length-4 need to be checked for space/hyphen since there is no word with less than 3 letters.
