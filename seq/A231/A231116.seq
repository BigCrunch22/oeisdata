%N A231116 Numbers n such that the total number of digits of all the divisors of n written in base 2 is equal to n.
%C A231116 Sequence is finite with 4 terms.
%C A231116 Numbers n such that the concatenation of their divisors written in base 2 contains n digits.
%C A231116 Subsequence of finite sequence:  1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 (numbers n such that the total number of digits of all the divisors of n written in base 2 is greater than or equal to n).
%C A231116 Numbers n such that A182627(n) = n.
%e A231116 24 is in the sequence because the concatenation of the divisors of 24 in base 2 [(1, 10, 11, 100, 110, 1000, 1100, 11000) -> 110111001101000110011000] contains 24 digits.
