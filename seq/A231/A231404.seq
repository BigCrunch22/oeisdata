%N A231404 Integers n dividing the Lucas sequence u(n), where u(i) = 2*u(i-1) - 4*u(i-2) with initial conditions u(0)=0, u(1)=1.
%C A231404 The sequence consists of all nonnegative powers of 2, together with all positive multiples of 3. There are infinitely many pairs of consecutive integers in this sequence.

%e A231404 For n=0,...,4 we have u(n)= 0,1,2,0,-8. Clearly n=1,2,3,4 are in the sequence.

%Y A231404 Cf. A088138 (Lucas sequence).
%Y A231404 Equal to union of A008585 (multiples of 3) and A000079 (powers of 2).
