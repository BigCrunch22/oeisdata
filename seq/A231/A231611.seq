%N A231611 The least k such that the polynomial cyclotomic(k,x) has n different coefficients.
%e A231611 The polynomial cyclotomic(2,x) is x + 1, which has both coefficients equal to 1. Hence, a(1) = 2. The polynomial cyclotomic(1,x) is x - 1, which has two coefficients 1 and -1. Hence, a(2) = 1. The polynomial cyclotomic(12,x) is x^4 + 0*x^3 - x^2 + 0*x + 1, which has coefficients -1, 0, and 1. This is the first cyclotomic polynomial having 3 different coefficients. Hence a(3) = 12.
