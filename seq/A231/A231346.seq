%N A231346 Number of distinct polygonal shapes after n-th stage in the structure of the D-toothpick cellular automaton of A220500.
%C A231346 The cellular automaton of A220500 contains a large number of distinct polygonal shapes. The exact number is unknown. Apparently it's greater than 63.
%C A231346 For simplicity we also call polygonal shapes "polygons".
%C A231346 In order to construct this sequence we use the following rules:
%C A231346 - Consider only the convex polygons and the concave polygons. Self-intersecting polygons are not counted.
%C A231346 - Unfinished polygons with inward growth are not counted.
%C A231346 - If two polygons have the same shape but they have different size then these polygons must be counted as distinct polygonal shapes.
%C A231346 - The reflected shapes of asymmetric polygons, both with the same area, must be counted as distinct polygonal shapes.
%C A231346 Question: Is there a maximal record in this sequence?
