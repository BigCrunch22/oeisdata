%N A231367 a(n) = characteristic function of numbers k such that A024816(m) = k has solution, where A024816(m) = sums of non-divisors of m = antisigma(m).

%F A231367 a(n) = 1 for such n that A231366(n) >= 1, a(n) = 0 for such n that A231366(n) = 0.
%e A231367 a(2) = 1 because there is number m with antisigma(m) = 2; m = 3.
