%N A231270 Irregular table read by rows r=0,1,2..., which contain the list of numbers whose (American) English name has no letter in common with that of r.
%C A231270 Row lengths are given in A227857. See there for links (motivation) and further discussion.
%C A231270 I conjecture that the table is finite and ends with row 6000000000000000000006006000006 having the entry [3], see examples and the (supposed) complete list given in the links section.
%H A231270 M. F. Hasler, <a href="/A231270/a231270.txt">List of n, row(n) for all nonempty rows</a>.
%e A231270 row 0: zero => six, fifty, fifty-six, sixty, sixty-six.
%e A231270 row 1: one => six, thirty, thirty-six, fifty, fifty-six, sixty, sixty-six.
%e A231270 row 2: two => five, six, seven, nine, eleven, five hundred, five hundred five, ..., nine hundred eleven.
%e A231270 row 3: three => six, six million, six million six, six billion, six billion six, six billion six million, six billion six million six, six nonillion, ..., six nonillion six billion six million six.
%e A231270 row 4: four => six,seven,eight,nine,ten,eleven,twelve,......
%e A231270 row 5: five => two, two thousand, two thousand two.
%e A231270 Row 13 and row 15 are the first empty rows, i.e., of length 0, i.e., row 12 [4, 6] is followed by data for row 14 [6], then row 16 [4].
%e A231270 Most rows for larger numbers are empty, e.g. 145..199, 245..299, ..., 712..899, 912..1999. After row 2002 [5], the only nonempty rows are those listed in row 3, containing only [3].
