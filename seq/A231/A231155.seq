%N A231155 Largest k such that no sum of digits is divisible by n (zeros not allowed in the digits of k).
%C A231155 a(n) has fewer than n digits, a special case of the fact that n integers always contain a sub(multi)set with a sum divisible by n.
%C A231155 The single digits appear to be periodic with period 210. - _T. D. Noe_, Nov 05 2013
%C A231155 This follows from the formula. Note also that the only digits which appear are 1, 5, 7, 8, and 9. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Nov 06 2013
%F A231155 a(n) consists of n-1 digits of d where d is the largest digit such that GCD(n,d)=1.
%F A231155 a(n) = A231470(n)*(10^(n-1)-1)/9. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 09 2013
%e A231155 a(4) = 999 because none of 9, 9+9 or 9+9+9 are divisible by 4. All integers greater than 999 (with no zeros) have the property that some digit sum is divisible by 4, e.g., 1235 has 3+1.
