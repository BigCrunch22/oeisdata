%N A231723 a(n) = the difference between the n-th node of the infinite trunk of the factorial beanstalk (A219666(n)) and the smallest integer (A219653(n)) which is as many A219651-iteration steps distanced from the root (zero); a(n) = A219666(n) - A219653(n).
%C A231723 For all n, the following holds:  A219653(n) <= A219666(n) <= A219655(n). This sequence gives the distance of the node n in the infinite trunk of factorial beanstalk (A219666(n)) from the left (lesser) edge of the A219654(n) wide window which it at that point must pass through.
%C A231723 This sequence relates to the factorial base representation (A007623) in the same way as A218603 relates to the binary system and similar remarks apply here.
