%N A231935 Greatest prime Q < 2*n such that 2*n-Q=P prime < Q starting at n=4.
%C A231935 All the primes >3 appear at least once in the sequence.
%C A231935 When a prime appears only once in the sequence, it is the smaller prime of a twin pair, but the smaller prime of a twin pair may be present more than once.
%C A231935 When a prime Q is present only once in the sequence as the smaller prime of a twin pair Q,Q+2 P=3=2*n-Q.
%C A231935 The primes Q are mainly in increasing order with repetitions, if the gap between two consecutive primes is > 6 there is at least one prime placed in decreasing order.
%C A231935 There are always 2 consecutive primes Q1 and Q2 with Q2 the greatest < 2*n for n>3, and as n increases the gap Q2-Q1 may increase also, but the total number of odd prime numbers P increases as 2*n/(2+log(n))and the gaps as 2+log(n) so it seems there are enough P candidates < Q/2 such that P+Q=2*n.
