%N A059589 Sums of factorials of distinct integers.
%C A059589 0! and 1! are treated as distinct.
%C A059589 From _Bernard Schott_, Apr 13 2017: (Start)
%C A059589 Factorial numbers (A000142) are included in this sequence.
%C A059589 Only one factorial (2!) is the sum of distinct factorials in more than one way: 2! = 0! + 1!.
%C A059589 (End)
%C A059589 Sequence contains the same nonzero terms as A059590, and in addition also each term immediately after each maximal run of consecutive terms in A059590. For example, because A059590 contains numbers 30, 31, 32, 33, this sequence contains the same four terms, and also 34 which follows them but is not included in A059590. - _Antti Karttunen_, Apr 15 2017
