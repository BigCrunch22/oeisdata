%N A059451 Number of ways n can be written as the sum of two numbers whose binary expansions have even numbers of zeros; also number of ways n can be written as the sum of two numbers whose binary expansions have odd numbers of zeros.
%C A059451 The only place where the two sequences differ is a(0) which is 1 for the odds and 0 for the evens.
