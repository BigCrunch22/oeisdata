%N A059965 For m>0, each n+m > 5 is expressed as Sum_{k = x,y,z}(pk)_m where (pk)_m is a prime with x <= y <= z; a(n) = largest m such that (pk)_1 = (pk)_2 = ... = (pk)_m.
%C A059965 Goldbach conjectured that every integer >5 is the sum of three primes. 6=2+2+2, 7=2+2+3, 8=2+3+3, 9=3+3+3=2+2+5,...

%e A059965 For an integer n we consider representations of n as the sum of three primes. We are looking for a prime that occurs in the representations as many consecutive integers starting from n+1 as possible.
%e A059965 a(5) = 7 because we can write 6=2+2+2, 7=2+2+3, 8=2+3+3, 9=2+2+5, 10=2+3+5, 11=2+2+7, 12=2+5+5 (all of which contain the prime 2), but there is no way to write 13=2+p+q for primes p and q.
%e A059965 Similarly, a(6) = 7 because we can write 7=2+2+3, 8=2+3+3, 9=3+3+3, 10=2+3+5, 11=3+3+5, 12=2+3+7, 13=3+5+5 (all of which contain the prime 3), but there is no way to write 14=3+p+q for primes p and q.
%e A059965 Notice the representations used for a(5) and a(6) differ for 9, 11, and 12. In general, it is necessary to consider all possible representations for each number and all the primes occurring in those representations as potential candidates.
