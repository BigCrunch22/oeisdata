%N A216840 Smallest palindromic number of 3 digits in two bases differing by n.
%C A216840 This is one of a collection of sequences of doubly palindromic numbers of same lengths in each of two bases.  The lengths go from 2 through 17, excluding 16 (only one term available at present), and the order of the first two of these are switched in terms of their A-numbers.  These are the A216*** cross-references.  The 171*** c-refs are to a variety of record multiple-base palindromes.  Larger comments are to be found -- will generally be -- in the 2-palindrome sequence.  The smaller bases of a pair here are (in sequence) 4, 3, 6, 5, 6, 7, 6, 6, 7, 7.

%e A216840 The first entry here, 46 in base 10, is represented as 222 in base 4 and 141 in base 5. The 2nd entry here, 26 in base 10, is represented as 222 in base 3 and 101 in base 5. The next is then the smallest in bases that differ by 3, bases 6 and 9 by what is in the comment.
%e A216840 a(3) = 121 is 232 in base 7, a(5) = 157 is 313 in base 7 and 111 in base 12, a(6) = 211 is 323 in base 8 and 111 in base 14. - _Chai Wah Wu_, Aug 19 2015
