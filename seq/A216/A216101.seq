%N A216101 Primes which are the integer harmonic mean of the previous prime and the following prime.
%C A216101 The harmonic mean of N numbers p1,p2,..,pN is the number H whose reciprocal is the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of p1,p2,..,pN; that is to say, 1/H = ((1/p1)+(1/p2)+..+(1/pN))/N.
%C A216101 So, for two quantities p1 and p2, their harmonic mean may be written as H=(2*p1*p2)/(p1+p2).
%C A216101 The harmonic mean (sometimes called the subcontrary mean) is one of several kinds of average. Typically, it is appropriate for situations when the average of rates is desired.

%e A216101 The primes before and after the prime p=13 are p1=11 and p2=17. So, the harmonic mean of p1 and p2 is 2*11*17/(11+17)=13.35714285... whose integer part is p=13. Then p=13 belongs to the sequence.
%e A216101 The primes before and after the prime p=17 are p1=13 and p2=19. The harmonic mean of p1 and p2 is 2*13*19/(13+19)=15.4375, having 15 as its integer part. Therefore, as 15<>p, p=17 is not in the sequence.
