%N A216907 Smallest palindromic number of length 13 in two bases differing by n.
%C A216907 See comments sections of A216840 and A216841.  Smallest of pair of bases are 8, 12, 14, 17, 19, 22, 24, 30, 32.  For the remarkable case a(10), not only does the number have four 7s in a row in base 10, but it also has prime reversal there and in its 2nd base of 13-palindromicity, 42, no digit larger than 20 appears.  A216*** cross-references are others in a collection of sequences that includes this one, while A171*** ones are various record multi-base palindromes.
