%N A216047 Consider the ordered Goldbach partitions of the even numbers m. Then a(n) is the least m which contains prime(n) such partitions composed of odd primes.

%e A216047 With n = 1:  prime(1) = 2, so we want the least m that has 2 such partitions.  For m = 4, 4 = {2+2}, but 2 is not an odd prime number.  For m = 6, 6 has one such partition, {3+3}, but 1 is not a prime number.  For m = 8, 8 has two such partitions, {3+5, 5+3}, so a(1) = 8.
%e A216047 a(3) = 22: With n = 3, prime(3) = 5 and 22 = {3+19, 5+17, 11+11, 17+5, 19+3}.
