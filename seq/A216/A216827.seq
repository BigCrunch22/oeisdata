%N A216827 Numbers whose squares can be written neither as a^2 + b^2, nor as a^2 + 2*b^2, nor as a^2 + 3*b^2, nor as a^2 + 7*b^2, with a > 0 and b > 0.
%C A216827 If a composite number C can be written in the form C = a^2+k*b^2, for some integers a and b, then every prime factor P (for C) being raised to an odd power can be written in the form P = c^2+k*d^2, for some integers c and d.
%C A216827 This statement is only true for k = 1, 2, 3.
%C A216827 For k = 7, with the exception of the prime factor 2, the statement mentioned above is true.
