%N A216074 Number of ways in which a four-player Old Maid match lasts for exactly n games until a player has been trolled exactly three times.
%C A216074 [From _V. Raman_, Dec 12 2012] (Start)
%C A216074 The Old Maid match is played with four players. For every game that is played, one of the four players is trolled at the end. The match ends when a player has been trolled three times, after which he loses the match.
%C A216074 So, to calculate the probability, we represent the four players by the digits 0, 1, 2, 3 in base 4 and then list out all the 18-bit numbers in base 4.
%C A216074 Then a(n) = Number of numbers for which from the left, some digit has occurred three times at the n-th position, i.e. 32 * A220017(n).
%C A216074 For four player match, the maximum number of games needed for a player to be trolled three times is 9. So, we consider with 9-digit base 4 numbers.
%C A216074 Total value of a(i), for i = 3..9 is equal to 4^9 = 262144.
%C A216074 Total value of A220017(i), for i = 3..9 is equal to 4^9/32 = 262144/32 = 8192. (relative chance)
%C A216074 gcd of a(i), for i = 3..9 is equal to 2^5 = 32.
%C A216074 The sequence A220017 gives the relative probability for the match to last exactly for n games. (End)
%F A216074 a(n) = 32 * A220017(n).
%Y A216074 Cf. A220017 (relative probability).
