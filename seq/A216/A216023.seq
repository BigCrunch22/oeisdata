%N A216023 Fermat pseudoprimes to base 2 divisible by 5.
%C A216023 Many Fermat pseudoprimes to base 2 divisible by 5 have one of the following four properties:
%C A216023 (1) the sum of their prime factors is divisible by the sum of their digits:
%C A216023 for 1105 = 3*5*17 we have 35 divisible by 15;
%C A216023 for 1905 = 3*5*127 we have 135 divisible by 15;
%C A216023 for 2465 = 5*17*29 we have 51 divisible by 17;
%C A216023 for 34945 = 5*29*241 we have 275 divisible by 25;
%C A216023 for 62745 = 3*5*47*89 we have 144 divisible by 24;
%C A216023 for 107185 = 3*5*47*89 we have 132 divisible by 22;
%C A216023 for 223345 = 5*19*2351 we have 2375 divisible by 19;
%C A216023 for 451905 = 3*5*47*641 we have 696 divisible by 24.
%C A216023 (2) the sum of their prime factors is divisible by 5 (1105, 1905, 16705, 18705, 34945, 223345, 757945, 800605).
%C A216023 (3) the sum of their digits is divisible by 5 (645, 1905, 11305, 34945, 72885, 208465, 72885);
%C A216023 (4) they are Harshad numbers (645, 1905, 2465, 223345, 757945).
%C A216023 Interesting is that the first property is found to other squarefree numbers, not Fermat pseudoprimes, divisible by 5 (e.g., for 1505 = 5*7*43 we have 55 divisible by 11, for 2555 = 5*7*73 we have 85 divisible by 17). It looks like it's a property which deserves further study.
%C A216023 Note: the four properties from above are also found to other Fermat pseudoprimes to base 2, but not in this high density (taking, for the second and third properties, a prime factor beside 5 and not considering for the third property the prime factor 3, because would be obviously satisfied).
