%N A216475 The number of numbers coprime to and less than n+2, excluding 2.
%C A216475 When integer divisions are considered we might pick a fixed nonnegative integer r as divisor for writing every nonnegative integer x as an expression of the form x=yr+z which assigns to x a unique ordered pair (y,z). This would be useful if we were interested in looking for prime numbers by trying to identify some topological or geometrical property instead of meeting arithmetic conditions for algorithms like the Lucas-Lehmer test.
%C A216475 The main interest in such a viewpoint is discarding all the "z" values for a fixed "r" that would not generate a prime number because those modulo "z" and the corresponding fixed divisor "r" are not coprime.
%C A216475 For example, setting r=12 as our divisor would leave only the chance of writing the prime numbers using "z" in {1,5,7,11}. Any other "z" will produce composite numbers.
%C A216475 When r=12, this formula becomes x=12y+z, and for odd numbers (sometimes also prime numbers ) "z" will be always one of the four integers in {1,5,7,11}.
%C A216475 A more interesting result is the following fact: Precisely with r=12 we might code and store a "map" of prime numbers as a computer file composed of ASCII characters (or some similar standard) for further processing in the hope of finding out some pattern or rule for predicting where the next prime will appear.
%C A216475 These ideas are in fact an informal description of a compression algorithm which translates 8-tuples of odd integers into single-byte computer characters, where the meaningful interpretation of such information depends on the offsets for each binary digit inside a byte.

%F A216475 a(2n) = phi(2n+2), a(2n+1) = phi(2n+3)-1, where phi is the Euler totient function. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Sep 12 2012
%e A216475 {1, 5, 7, 11} are coprime to 12, so a(10) = 4.
%e A216475 {1, 2, 3, 4} are coprime to 5, so a(3) = 3 since 2 is excluded.
