%N A332550 The 10-block imbalance of n (see Comments for definition).
%C A332550 In a certain country, digits come in sealed boxes containing 10 distinct digits each. To write the number 2019 you can open a single box and extract the digits 2, 0, 1, and 9.
%C A332550 We call the "imbalance" of 2019 the number of unused digit in the opened box(es). So writing 2019 leaves an imbalance of 6 (the 6 unused digits in the box).
%C A332550 If we want to write 2020 we must open two boxes - and leave behind 8 digits in the first box and 8 digits in the second one. This produces for 2020 an imbalance of 16.

%e A332550 10 has an imbalance of 8 - there are two unused digits in the box. For 11 we have to open two boxes to get the two 1's, leaving an imbalance of 9+9 = 18.
