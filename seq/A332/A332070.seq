%N A332070 Lexicographically earliest sequence with a(n) odd digits among the first a(n+1) decimal digits, for any n; a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2.
%C A332070 Without the requirement a(2) = 2 (or: increasing, or: without repeated terms), the trivial sequence (1, 1, 1, ...) = A000012 would also satisfy the definition, repeatedly stating that the first digit is odd, ignoring all other digits. But a(2) - a(1) > 0 implies that the sequence will be strictly increasing throughout, and therefore make infinitely many nontrivial statements concerning all of its digits.
%C A332070 The formula comes from the fact that if we have a(n-1) odd digits among the first a(n) digits, and we need a(n) odd digits among the first a(n+1) digits, then we must use exactly a(n) - a(n-1) odd digits after the a(n)-th digit up to and including the a(n+1)-th digit, whence a(n+1) >= a(n) + a(n) - a(n-1).

%F A332070 a(n+1) >= 2*a(n) - a(n-1) for n > 1.
%e A332070 There is a(1) = 1 odd digit, namely: '1', among the first a(2) = 2 digits which are '1' and '2'.
%e A332070 There are 2 odd digits ('1' and '3') among the first a(3) = 3 digits, '1', '2' and '3'.
%e A332070 Then there must be a(3) = 3 odd digits among the first a(4) digits. Since there are only 2 odd digits coming earlier, there must come at least 1 more odd digits. This excludes a(4) = 4, but makes the next smaller choice a(4) = 5 possible, provided it will be followed by an even digit in order to satisfy the requirement that there be exactly 3 odd digits among the first 5 digits.
%e A332070 Knowing that the first digit of a(5) must be even (see just above), and that a(5) >= 2 a(4) - a(3) = 7 (see formula, explained in comments), we have as smallest possibility a(5) = 8, which does not raise a contradiction.
%e A332070 Then again we can use a(6) = 2*8-5 = 11, least possibility according to the formula, and indeed not yet leading to a contradiction. However, these are digits number 6 and 7 of the sequence, both odd, and the previous two terms state that there must be 5 odd digits among the first 8 digits, so the next digit must be even.
%e A332070 According to the above, a(7) >= 20, the least integer > 2*11 - 8 starting with an even digit. It would be the 8th and 9th digit of the sequence. But we need a(5) = 8 odd digits among the first a(6) = 11 digits. If we use two even digits here, we can't reach the required 11 odd digits with the 5 odd digits up to a(8), the two '1's in position 6 & 7, and two more odd digits in position 10 & 11. This is only possible if the 9th digit is odd, too. So the smallest possibility is a(7) = 21.
%e A332070 And so on.
