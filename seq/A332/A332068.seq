%N A332068 Numbers whose English name has at least two vowels and all the vowels are in alphabetical order.
%C A332068 Here (as in most OEIS sequences) vowel means one of the five letters A, E, I, O or U. (One could imagine variants that use Y, too.)
%C A332068 No number with "hUndrEd", "thoUsAnd", or "One / twO / foUr mIllioN" (or "fIvE, nInE"...) in it has the required property.
%C A332068 The vowels are counted with multiplicity: e.g., "thrEE" with two 'E's is listed.
%C A332068 The subsequence of numbers which have at least two distinct vowels in alphabetical order is 0, 4, 8, 22, 24, 26, 28, 32, 34, 44, 52, 54, 62, 64, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 3000000, ...
%e A332068 Numbers 0, 3, 4, ... have the required property, since their English names are "zErO", "thrEE", "fOUr", ...
%e A332068 Numbers 1, 2, 5, ... ("OnE", "twO", "fIvE", ...) don't have the property (vowels in incorrect order or less than two).
