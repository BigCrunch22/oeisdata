%N A332100 Primes p such that 65535*p is not of the form q + 2^a + 2^b with a, b > 0 and q prime.
%C A332100 All terms > 5 of A156695 appear to be divisible by 255 = 2^8-1, many are also divisible by 257 = 2^8+1, and for roughly 10% of these (at least up to 10^12), the remaining factor is prime. This sequence lists these primes. So (65535*a(n)) is a (probably infinite) subsequence of A156695.
