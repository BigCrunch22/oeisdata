%N A332407 Number of simple graphs on n unlabeled nodes with upper domination number greater than independence number.
%C A332407 The upper domination number of a graph is the maximum cardinality of a minimal dominating set. For any graph the upper domination number is greater than or equal to the independence number. This sequence gives the number of graphs where it is strictly greater than.
%C A332407 The m X n rook graphs with 2 <= m < n are a class of graph with this property because the independence number is m, and a row of n rooks is minimally dominating.
