%N A332924 6*a(n) are the perimeters of distinct triangles with integer sides i <= j <= k, whose area equals 4 times their perimeter. Terms occurring more than once belong to different triangles.
%C A332924 There are 45 integer-sided triangles with 4*area = perimeter, with terms 28 and 119 corresponding to pairs, and terms 35 to a triple of such triangles with different sides.
%Y A332924 The 41 terms of A289220, divided by 24, are all terms of this sequence, but omitting distinct triangles with identical perimeters.
