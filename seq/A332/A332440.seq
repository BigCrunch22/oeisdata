%N A332440 Three-column array read by rows: the sequence of 14 triples of the positions of the numbers 0 to 13 in sequence A332439.
%C A332440 A332439 gives the vertex labels of a directed Euler tour (directed Eulerian cycle) on the regular 14-gon. Every label k from {0,1, ..., 13} for the vertices V^{(14)}_k (nodes) of this regular digraph of degree 6 appears thrice in this Euler tour of length 42.
%C A332440 The three positions of k in the tour A332439 = T are T(a(3*k)), T(a(3*k+1)) and T(a(3*k+2)), for k from {0,1, ..., 13}.
%F A332440 T(n, k), for n = 0, 1, ..., 13 and k = 1, 2, and 3, is the first, second and third appearance of n in A332439.
%e A332440 The label 0 (vertex V^{14}_0 = (r, 0) in Cartesian coordinates) appears at positions 0, 10 and 14 in the Euler tour A332439. This means that starting at V^{14}_0, one reaches this vertex again after 10 steps (a closed directed trail, using only distinct arrows). But no periodicity has been reached yet, and after another four steps one visits V^{14}_0 again (position 14), and finally periodicity is reached after another 28 steps (position 42 == 0 (mod 14)).
