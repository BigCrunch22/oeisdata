%N A332427 Irregular table read by rows: Take a nonagon with all diagonals drawn, as in A332421. Then T(n,k) = number of k-sided polygons in that figure for k >= 3.
%C A332427 See the links in A332421 for images of the nonagons.
%H A332427 Lars Blomberg, <a href="/A332427/b332427.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..241</a> (the first 23 rows)
%e A332427 A nonagon with no other points along its edges, n = 1, contains 90 triangles, 36 quadrilaterals, 18 pentagons, 9 hexagons, 1 nonagon and no other n-gons, so the first row is [90,36,18,9,0,0,1]. A nonagon with 1 point dividing its edges, n = 2, contains 1332 triangles, 918 quadrilaterals, 414 pentagons, 90 hexagons and no other n-gons, so the second row is [1332,918,414,90].
