%N A332927 6*a(n) are the perimeters of distinct triangles with integer sides i <= j <= k, whose area equals 7 times their perimeter. Terms occurring more than once belong to different triangles.
%C A332927 There are 80 integer-sided triangles with 7*area = perimeter, with terms 44, 90, and 205 corresponding to pairs of such triangles with different sides.
%Y A332927 The 77 terms of A289253, divided by 42, are all terms of this sequence, but omitting distinct triangles with identical perimeters.
