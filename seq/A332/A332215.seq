%N A332215 Mersenne-prime fixing variant of A243071: a(n) = A243071(A332213(n)).
%C A332215 Any Mersenne prime (A000668) times any power of 2 (i.e., 2^k, for k>=0) is fixed by this sequence, including also all even perfect numbers.
%C A332215 From _Antti Karttunen_, Jul 10 2020: (Start)
%C A332215 This is a "tuned variant" of A243071, and has many of the same properties.
%C A332215 For example, for n > 1, A007814(a(n)) = A007814(n) - A209229(n), that is, this map  preserves the 2-adic valuation of n, except when n is a power of two, in which cases that value is decremented by one, and in particular, a(2^k * n) = 2^k * a(n) for all n > 1. Also, like A243071, this bijection maps primes to the terms of A000225 (binary repunits). However, the "tuning" (A332213) has a specific effect that each Mersenne prime (A000668) is mapped to itself. Therefore the terms of A335431 are fixed by this map. Furthermore, I conjecture that there are no other fixed points. For the starters, see the proof in A335879, which shows that at least none of the terms of A335882 are fixed.
