%N A332235 Least integer t such that every binary word of length t+1 contains an split occurrence of an n-overlap.
%C A332235 An "n-overlap" is a word of the form xxx', where x is a nonempty word of length at least n, and x' is a prefix of x of length n.  Thus, for example, abcdabcdab is a 2-overlap.  A split occurrence of a pattern p is a word of the form xyz where xz matches the pattern.
%C A332235 For n = 0,1,2,3 the lexicographically least words achieving the bound are:
%C A332235 n = 0: 01
%C A332235 n = 1: 0011
%C A332235 n = 2: 000110100111
%C A332235 n = 3: 00111010100001010011101000011111000011010001110
