%N A332923 2*a(n) are the perimeters of distinct triangles with integer sides i <= j <= k, whose area equals 3 times their perimeter. Terms occurring more than once belong to different triangles.
%C A332923 There are 45 integer-sided triangles with 3*area = perimeter, with terms 35, 56, 76, and 91 corresponding to pairs of such triangles with different sides.
%Y A332923 The 41 terms of A289219, divided by 6, are all terms of this sequence, but omitting distinct triangles with identical perimeters.
