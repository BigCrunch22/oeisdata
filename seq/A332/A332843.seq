%N A332843 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive terms such that a(4n+1) is the sum of the next three terms, those three terms having the property that each of them is a substring of a(4n+1).
%C A332843 The sequence is infinite as one can always multiply a(4n+1) by 10 and do the same with the next three terms. It is conjectured that at least two of those three terms must be equal.

%e A332843 For n = 0, we have a(4n+1) = a(1) = 15 and 15 is the sum 5 + 5 + 5, those last three terms being a(2), a(3), a(4) and substrings of a(1);
%e A332843 For n = 3, we have a(4n+1) = a(13) = 182 and 182 is the sum 18 + 82 + 82, those last three terms being a(14), a(15), a(16) and substrings of a(13).
