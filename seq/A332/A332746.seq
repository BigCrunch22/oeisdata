%N A332746 Number of integer partitions of n such that either the run-lengths or the negated run-lengths are unimodal.
%C A332746 First differs from A000041 at a(14) = 134, A000041(14) = 135.
%C A332746 A sequence of positive integers is unimodal if it is the concatenation of a weakly increasing and a weakly decreasing sequence.

%e A332746 The only partition not counted under a(14) = 134 is (4,3,3,2,1,1), whose run-lengths (1,2,1,2) are neither unimodal nor is their negation.
%t A332746 unimodQ[q_]:=Or[Length[q]<=1,If[q[[1]]<=q[[2]],unimodQ[Rest[q]],OrderedQ[Reverse[q]]]]
%t A332746 Table[Length[Select[IntegerPartitions[n],unimodQ[Length/@Split[#]]||unimodQ[-Length/@Split[#]]&]],{n,0,30}]
%Y A332746 Looking only at the original run-lengths gives A332281.
%Y A332746 Looking only at the negated run-lengths gives A332639.
%Y A332746 The complement is counted by A332640.
%Y A332746 The Heinz numbers of partitions not in this class are A332643.
%Y A332746 Unimodal compositions are A001523.
%Y A332746 Partitions with unimodal run-lengths are A332280.
%Y A332746 Compositions whose negation is unimodal are A332578.
%Y A332746 Partitions whose negated run-lengths are unimodal are A332638.
%Y A332746 Run-lengths are neither weakly increasing nor weakly decreasing: A332641.
%Y A332746 Run-lengths and negated run-lengths are both unimodal: A332745.
