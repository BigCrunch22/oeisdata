%N A332079 Number of primes between 2^n and the least prime p > 2^n in A332075, i.e., such that k + 2^m is prime, where k and m are the odd part and 2-valuation, respectively, of p-1.
%C A332079 It appears that the sequence of odd numbers k*2^m+1 such that k + 2^m is prime (A332075) mainly consists of primes, and many primes are in this sequence. This sequence attempts to measure in how far this remains true for large numbers.
