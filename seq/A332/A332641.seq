%N A332641 Number of integer partitions of n whose run-lengths are neither weakly increasing nor weakly decreasing.
%C A332641 Also partitions whose run-lengths and negated run-lengths are not both unimodal. A sequence of positive integers is unimodal if it is the concatenation of a weakly increasing and a weakly decreasing sequence.
