%N A332925 6*a(n) are the perimeters of distinct triangles with integer sides i <= j <= k, whose area equals 5 times their perimeter. Terms occurring more than once belong to different triangles.
%C A332925 There are 52 integer-sided triangles with 5*area = perimeter, with terms 22, 28, 68, 77, and 182 corresponding to pairs of such triangles with different sides.
%Y A332925 The 47 terms of A289221, divided by 30, are all terms of this sequence, but omitting distinct triangles with identical perimeters.
