%N A332755 Lapidary numbers.
%C A332755 Consider a two-player stone-throwing game with a single shared pile of stones. The players alternately remove one or more stones from the pile until it is empty. In addition, each player seeks to communicate a message through their sequence of moves. If there are initially n stones then a(n) is the largest number m such that both players can communicate at least m distinct messages.
%C A332755 For n > 0, a(n) is also the size of the Durfee square of the partition defined in A064660.

%F A332755 Asymptotically, a(n) is within a subexponential factor of 2^(n/2).
%e A332755 For n=4, one strategy which allows both players to communicate one of two messages is each remove one or two stones on their first turn.
