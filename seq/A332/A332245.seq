%N A332245 Positive integers represented by the ternary quadratic form 5x^2 + 8y^2 + 8z^2 - 5yz - xz - 4xy; equally, positive integers represented by the ternary quadratic form 5x^2 + 5y^2 + 8z^2 - yz - 4xz - 2xy.
%C A332245 Ju shows that the integers represented by the two ternary forms are identical.
%C A332245 This is S1 on Table 1.1 of Ju's paper.

%e A332245 9 is (1, 1, 0) in the first form since 9 = 5*1^2 + 8*1^2 - 4*1*1 = 5 + 8 - 4. It is (1, 0, 1) in the second form for similar reasons.
%e A332245 14 is (-1, 0, 1) in the first form since 14 = 5*(-1)^2 + 8*1^2 - (-1)*1 = 5 + 8 + 1. It is (0, -1, 1) in the second form since 14 = 5*(-1)^2 + 8*1^2 - (-1)*1 = 5 + 8 + 1.
