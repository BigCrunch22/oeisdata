%N A332478 Number that are unitary norm-multiply-perfect numbers in Gaussian integers.
%C A332478 Numbers k such that their norm of sum of unitary divisors in Gaussian integers, A332474(k), is divisible by their norm, k^2.
%C A332478 The corresponding ratios A332474(a(n))/(a(n)^2) are 1, 4, 1, 5, 5, 2, 5.
%e A332478 10 is a term since its sum of unitary divisors in Gaussian integers is -12 + 16*i, whose norm (-12)^2 + 16^2 = 400 is divisible by 10^2 = 100.
