%N A332886 a(n) is the number of partition numbers that divide the n-th partition number (counted without multiplicity).
%C A332886 Conjecture:  every positive integer occurs infinitely many times.
%F A332886 a(n) = A332887(n) + 2.
%e A332886 Let p(n) = A000041(n) = number of partitions of n.  Then p(9) = 30, which is divisible by these 6 partition numbers: p(1) = 1, p(2) = 2, p(3) = 3, p(4) = 5, p(7) = 15, and p(9) = 30; thus a(9) = 6.
%e A332886 a(1) = 1 counts p(0) = 1 and p(1) = 1 as 1 divisor, as opposed to 2 numbers that have 1 as a divisor.
