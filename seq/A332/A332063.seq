%N A332063 a(1) = 1, a(n + 1) = a(n) + Sum_{k = 1..n} floor(log_2(a(k)) + 1): add total number of bits of the terms so far.
%C A332063 By number of bits we mean A070939 (length of base-2 representation), not the sum of nonzero bits or Hamming weight A000120.
%C A332063 One might consider starting this sequence with a(0) = 0, and defining (for the purpose of this sequence) log 0 = 0 as to get 1 for the number of bits of zero (although it is as well justified to consider 0 to have 0 bits). In that case one would get the sequence b(n) = a(n) + (n-1): (0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 25, 41, 63, 91, 126, 168, ...), similar to, but different from A004006.

%Y A332063 Cf. A070939 (length of base-2 representation), A000120 (hammingweight).
%Y A332063 Cf. A332064 for a variant where the number of bits is added or subtracted, depending on the parity of a(n).
