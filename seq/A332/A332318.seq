%N A332318 Real part of Gaussian norm-multiply-perfect numbers, in order of increasing norm.
%C A332318 Norm-multiply-perfect numbers where defined by Spira as Gaussian integers z such that norm(sigma(z)) is divisible by norm(z), where sigma(z) is the sum of the divisors of z = a + b*i and norm(z) = z * conj(z) = a^2 + b^2.
%C A332318 If the ratio norm(sigma(z))/norm(z) is 2 then the number is called a norm-perfect. The norm-perfect numbers correspond to n = 1, 13, 26, ... They are 2 + i, 21 + 22*i, 56 + 64*i, ...
%C A332318 Only nonnegative terms are included, since if z = a + b*i is a norm-multiply-perfect number then z*i, -z and -z*i are also norm-multiply-perfect numbers and one of the four has nonnegative a and b. Terms with the same norm are ordered by their real parts.
%C A332318 The corresponding imaginary parts are in A332319.
%C A332318 The corresponding norms are 1, 5, 10, 10, 40, 50, 52, 200, 260, 260, 260, 468, ...
%C A332318 The corresponding ratios norm(sigma(k))/k are 1, 2, 5, 4, 5, 8, 5, 10, 9, 10, ...

%e A332318 2 + i is a norm-perfect number since sigma(2 + i) = 3 + i, and (3^2 + 1^2) = 10 = 2 * 5 = 2 * (2^1 + 1^2).
%e A332318 1 + 3*i is a norm-multiply-perfect number since sigma(1 + 3*i) = 5 + 5*i, and (5^2 + 5^2) = 50 = 5 * 10 = 5 * (1^2 + 3^2).
