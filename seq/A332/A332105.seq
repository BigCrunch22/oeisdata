%N A332105 a(n) is the smallest number k that can be partitioned into a set of n distinct positive even integers {e(1), e(2), ..., e(n)} where the sum of e(i)*(e(i)-1) for i = 1 to n equals k*(k-1)/2.
%C A332105 These numbers solve the problem of what is the required minimum even number of socks of n colors such that a random drawing of two socks has a 50% chance of matching.
%e A332105 For n = 3, {6, 48, 90} is the set of even numbers with the smallest sum that has this property. With 6 socks of one color, 48 socks of another color, and 90 socks of a third color, there is exactly a 50% chance that a random draw of two socks will produce a matching pair. (6*5 + 48*47 + 90*89) = (144*143) / 2.
