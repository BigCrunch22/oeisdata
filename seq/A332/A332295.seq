%N A332295 Number of widely recursively normal integer partitions of n.
%C A332295 A sequence is widely recursively normal if either it is all 1's (wide) or its run-lengths cover an initial interval of positive integers (normal) and are themselves a widely recursively normal sequence.
%e A332295 The a(1) = 1 through a(8) = 12 partitions:

%e A332295 For example, starting with y = (4,3,2,2,1) and repeatedly taking run-lengths gives (4,3,2,2,1) -> (1,1,2,1) -> (2,1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,1), all of which have normal run-lengths, so y is widely recursively normal. On the other hand, starting with y and repeatedly taking multiplicities gives (4,3,2,2,1) -> (2,1,1,1) -> (3,1), so y is not fully normal (A317491).
%e A332295 Starting with y = (5,4,3,3,2,2,2,1,1) and repeatedly taking run-lengths gives (5,4,3,3,2,2,2,1,1) -> (1,1,2,3,2) -> (2,1,1,1) -> (1,3), so y is not widely recursively normal. On the other hand, starting with y and repeatedly taking multiplicities gives (5,4,3,3,2,2,2,1,1) -> (3,2,2,1,1) -> (2,2,1) -> (2,1) -> (1,1), so y is fully normal (A317491).

%t A332295 Table[Length[Select[IntegerPartitions[n],recnQ]],{n,0,30}]
%Y A332295 The narrow version is A000012.
%Y A332295 Partitions with normal multiplicities are A317081.
%Y A332295 The Heinz numbers of these partitions are a proper superset of A317492.
%Y A332295 Accepting any constant sequence instead of just 1's gives A332272.
%Y A332295 The total (instead of recursive) version is A332277.
%Y A332295 The case of reversed partitions is this same sequence.
%Y A332295 The alternating (instead of recursive) version is this same sequence.
%Y A332295 Dominated by A332576.
