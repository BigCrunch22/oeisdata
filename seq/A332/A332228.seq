%N A332228 Odd numbers n, not powers of primes, such that sigma(n) is congruent to 2 modulo 8.
%C A332228 Proof that any odd perfect number, if such numbers exist at all, has to reside in this sequence: As all terms in A228058 are = 1 modulo 4 (their binary expansion ends as "01"), and taking sigma of an odd perfect number would multiply it by two (shift one bit-position left), the base-2 expansion of that result would end as "010", i.e., sigma(k) modulo 8 should be 2 (not 6) for such numbers k.
