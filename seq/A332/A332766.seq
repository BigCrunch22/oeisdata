%N A332766 Numbers k for which there exists a group of order k that cannot be generated by A051903(k) elements.
%C A332766 For such k, it follows from the MathOverflow thread in Links that 1 + A051903(k) generators suffice.
%C A332766 Lists all k such that A059829(k) != A051903(k). Also k such that A059829(k) = 1 + A051903(k).

%H A332766 MathOverflow, <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/225172/">How large can the smallest generating set of a group G of order n be?</a>
%e A332766 k=20 is 2^2*5, so maximal exponent is 2. All five groups of order 20 can be generated by 2 elements. So 20 does NOT belong here.
%e A332766 On the other hand, k=21 is 3*7, so maximal exponent is 1. But there exists a group of order 21 that cannot be generated by 1 element. Therefore 21 belongs in this sequence.
