%N A332866 Length of shortest ternary squarefree word having n periods.
%C A332866 A word is squarefree if it has no contiguous block inside it of the form xx, for a word x.
%C A332866 A period of a word w is an integer 1 <= p <= |w| such that w[i]=w[i+p] for all indices i that make sense.   For example, "alfalfa" has period 3.   Every nonempty word trivially has a period equal to its length.
