%N A332952 Squarefree semiprimes which never occur in A245486.
%C A332952 Also squarefree semiprimes which never occur in A332951.
%C A332952 This sequence is infinite. It appears that all terms can be divisible by 2 or 3.
%C A332952 If A014664(i) = A014664(j) for some 1 < i < j, then 2*prime(i) is a term. See A245486 for more information.
