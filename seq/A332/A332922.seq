%N A332922 2*a(n) are the perimeters of distinct triangles with integer sides i <= j <= k, whose area equals 2 times their perimeter. Terms occurring more than once belong to different triangles.
%C A332922 There are 18 integer-sided triangles with 2*area = perimeter, with terms 42 corresponding to a pair of such triangles with different sides.
%Y A332922 Equals A289218/2.
%Y A332922 Cf. A289219, A289220, A289221, A332879, A289253 (all merging terms for triangles with identical perimeters, but different sides).
