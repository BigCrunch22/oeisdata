%N A332434 Irregular triangle read by rows: r-tuples (lengths) of the complete coach system Sigma(2*n+1), for n >= 1.
%C A332434 The length of row n of this irregular triangle is A135303(n). The row sums are given in A332435, where more details are found.
%C A332434 For the complete coach system Sigma(b), with b = 2*n+1, for n >= 1, see the Hilton and Pedersen [HP] reference. The coach numbers are c(b) = c(2*n+1) = A135303(n), and the quasi-order of 2 modulo b is k(n) = A003558(n). The number of entries (length) of a specific coach of Sigma(b), say C(b; j), for j from {1, 2, ..., c(b)} is r(b;j), and the present array lists the r-tuples R(b) = (r(b; 1), ..., (b; c(b)). These R(b) numbers give the length of the (primitive) periods of the cycles of the first rows of each coach.
%C A332434 The parity of the entries of each row is identical ([HP], p. 261).
%C A332434 This table and a computation shows that part two of item (2) of 'Some open questions' of [HP], p. 281, namely 'Is it the case that the smallest r always occurs in the first coach (where a_1 =1)?' has the answer no. For the first counterexamples see: b = 46, 99, 109, 155, 157, 189, ..., with the r-tuples (6,4,8), (9,7), (9,7,11), (10,8,12), (13,11,15) (10,8,8), ...

%F A332434 T(n, j) gives the length of the j-th coach of the complete coach system Sigma(b), with b = 2*n+1, for n >= 1, and j = 1, 2, ..., A135303(n).

%e A332434 In the following the complete coach is written as a list of list of coaches, and the first and second rows (the a- and k-numbers) of a coach are separated by a semicolon. Here only the first part of a coach list (the top row of a coach) is of interest.
%e A332434 n = 5, b = 11: Sigma(11) = [[1, 5, 3;  1, 1, 3]], hence T(5, 1) = 3 or R(11) = (r(11,1)) = (3).
%e A332434 n = 8, b = 17: Sigma(17) = [[1; 4], [3, 7, 5; 1, 1, 2]], hence T(8, 1) = 1, T(8, 2) = 3.
%e A332434 n = 16, b = 33:  Sigma(33) = [[1; 5], [5, 7, 13; 2, 1, 2]], hence T(16, 1) = 1, T(16, 2) = 3.
