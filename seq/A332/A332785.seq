%N A332785 Nonsquarefree numbers that are not squareful.
%C A332785 Sometimes nonsquarefree numbers are misnamed squareful numbers (see 1st comment of A013929). Indeed, every squareful number > 1 is nonsquarefree, but the converse is false. This sequence = A013929 \ A001694 and consists of these counterexamples.
%C A332785 This sequence is not a duplicate: the first 16 terms (<= 68) are the same first 16 terms of A059404, A323055, A242416 and A303946, then 72 is the 17th term of these 4 sequences. Also, the first 37 terms (<= 140) are the same first 37 terms of A317616 then 144 is the 38th term of this last sequence.
%C A332785 From _Amiram Eldar_, Sep 17 2023: (Start)
%C A332785 Called "hybrid numbers" by Jakimczuk (2019).
%C A332785 These numbers have a unique representation as a product of two numbers > 1, one is squarefree (A005117) and the other is powerful (A001694).
%C A332785 Equivalently, numbers k such that A055231(k) > 1 and A057521(k) > 1.
%C A332785 Equivalently, numbers that have in their prime factorization at least one exponent that is equal to 1 and at least one exponent that is larger than 1.
%C A332785 The asymptotic density of this sequence is 1 - 1/zeta(2) (A229099). (End)

%F A332785 Sum_{n>=1} 1/a(n)^s = 1 + zeta(s) - zeta(s)/zeta(2*s) - zeta(2*s)*zeta(3*s)/zeta(6*s), s > 1. - _Amiram Eldar_, Sep 17 2023
%e A332785 18 = 2 * 3^2 is nonsquarefree as it is divisible by the square 3^2, but it is not squareful because 2 divides 18 but 2^2 does not divide 18, hence 18 is a term.
%e A332785 72 = 2^3 * 3^2 is nonsquarefree as it is divisible by the square 3^2, but it is also squareful because primes 2 and 3 divide 72, and 2^2 and 3^2 divide also 72, so 72 is not a term.
