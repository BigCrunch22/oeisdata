%N A332080 Irregular table in which row n = 1, 2, 3... lists the lexicographically first triangle of height and width n with minimal sum, distinct positive entries using only digits <= n and no diagonal having the same digit in two entries.
%C A332080 The triangles consist of n rows of length 1, 2, ..., n, respectively. Diagonals are considered in both directions, SE & SW. Alternatively, these are rows and columns if the triangle is the upper left half of an n X n matrix, entries read by rising antidiagonals.
%C A332080 To have digits up to n, we use base n+1 for the entries in row n. To make the data easier to read, we give the terms in the base-(n+1) representation. Up to row 9 or a(165) this is the same as if we used always base 10. For rows n >= 10^D, we can use D+1 decimal digits for each base-(n+1) digit.
%C A332080 There is always a "trivial" solution, non-minimal for n > 2, of the form:
%C A332080             9
%C A332080           8   88
%C A332080        7   77   777
%C A332080     ...           ...
%C A332080   1   11  111 ...    11...1
%C A332080 Here, (9, 8, 7, ...) represent the digits (n, n-1, n-2, ...).
%C A332080 This solution, where the k-th row is filled with repdigits (A010785), can always be improved towards a smaller total sum of elements by replacing the largest terms in each row by smaller terms involving the additional digit '0' or a larger digit. In particular, one could replace 88 by 80 in the second row above; replace (7, 777) by (70, 7) in the 3rd row; (666, 6666) by (60, 666) in the 4th row. One can also avoid 666 by using 69 in the second position of the 4th row.
%C A332080 Then, no digit 0 would be possible in the 5th row, but one can still avoid 5555 and 55555 in favor of 58 and 59, etc. However, following this algorithm in a greedy manner will not always give a minimal solution, see examples for n >= 5.

%e A332080 For n = 1, the triangle is reduced to a single number, [ 1 ].
%e A332080 For n = 2, we have the triangle:       2
%e A332080   so row 2 = [ 2 ; 1, 10 ].          1   10
%e A332080   (Obviously the symmetric triangle [2; 10, 1] has the same minimal sum, but it comes later in lexicographical order.)
%e A332080 For n = 3, we have the triangle to the right:               3
%e A332080   This gives row 3 = [3; 2, 20; 10, 1, 11]                2   20
%e A332080   with minimal sum = 47 (using base 10).               10   1    11
%e A332080   (Using base 4 the sum is 113[4] = 23[10].)
%e A332080 For n = 4, we have the triangle:                   4
%e A332080   The entries yield row 4 =                      3   30
%e A332080   [4; 3, 30; 20, 2, 22; 1, 14, 10, 11].       20   2   22
%e A332080   See below for the sum.                    1   14   10  11
%e A332080 This is the lexicographically earliest triangle for n = 5 with minimal sum. Indeed:
%e A332080 - We have to start with 4 to avoid the larger number 40 elsewhere in the table; using 40 somewhere would make the sum of the entries larger by 10 or more.
%e A332080 - For a similar reason, we use leading digit 3 in the second row. If we used leading digit 2 here, we would need an entry >= 33 in the 3rd row.
%e A332080 - We can't for example put 2 in the first place of the second row, because in the second and third place, no digit 0 may appear, since there is already the one from "30" in the second "SW/NE" diagonal and in the rightmost "NW/SE" diagonal. Thus, if we don't start the row with 20, we'd have to use 222 later in that row (or in the next one if we use a digit 1 in this 2nd row).
%e A332080 - In the last row we can use "10" only in the 3rd place because of the digits 0 in 20 and 30. But we can use 14 in the 2nd place. This achieves the minimal sum of 117 if we compute 4 + 3 + 30 + 20 + 2 + 22 + 1 + 14 + 10 + 11 in base 10.
%e A332080   If we consider these as numbers written in base 5, the sum is 232[5] = 67[10].
%e A332080   In any case this is the smallest possible sum.
%e A332080 For n = 5, we have the triangle    5
%e A332080                                  4  44
%e A332080                                3  33  30
%e A332080                              2  20  25  22
%e A332080                            1  15  14  10  11
%e A332080 The sum of these base-6 numbers is 423[6] = 159[10].
%e A332080 Here we do not use 40 in place of 44, which would allow only solutions with larger total sum: more precisely, one would then need to use a term >= 55 in the last row (or larger terms in earlier rows).
%e A332080 One possibly minimal solution for n = 6 could be:
%e A332080                          5
%e A332080                        6  66
%e A332080                     30   3  40
%e A332080                    4  44  55  33
%e A332080                  2  25  26  20  22
%e A332080                1  10  13  15  14  11,  sum in base 7: 652[7] = 331[10].
%e A332080 and for n = 7:
%e A332080                           5
%e A332080                         6   7
%e A332080                      77  55  44
%e A332080                    40   4   3  30
%e A332080                   3  36  50  47  66
%e A332080                 2  20  27  26  22  222
%e A332080               1  11  16  15  13  10  111,  sum in base 8: 1353[8] = 747[10].
%e A332080 A proof of minimality of these, using, e.g., exhaustive search with backtracking, would be appreciated.
