%N A332275 Number of totally co-strong integer partitions of n.
%C A332275 A sequence is totally co-strong if it is empty, equal to (1), or its run-lengths are weakly increasing (co-strong) and are themselves a totally co-strong sequence.
%C A332275 Also the number of totally strong reversed integer partitions of n.

%e A332275 For example, the partition y = (5,4,4,4,3,3,3,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1) has run-lengths (1,3,3,6,6), with run-lengths (1,2,2), with run-lengths (1,2), with run-lengths (1,1), with run-lengths (2), with run-lengths (1). All of these having weakly increasing run-lengths, and the last is (1), so y is counted under a(44).

%Y A332275 The strong version is A316496.
%Y A332275 The version for reversed partitions is (also) A316496.
%Y A332275 The alternating version is A317256.
