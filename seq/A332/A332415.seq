%N A332415 a(n) is the number of distinct valid solutions taking into account the ambiguity of open and closed absolute value bars for an input of -1 to -2*(n)-1 with absolute value bars between each (|-1|, |-1|-2|-3|, |-1|-2|-3|-4|-5|, etc.).
%C A332415 a(5) is the solution to Jim Propp's submitted problem published in FiveThirtyEight's "The Riddler" column.
