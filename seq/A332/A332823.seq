%N A332823 A 3-way classification indicator generated by the products of two consecutive primes and the cubes of primes. a(n) is -1, 0, or 1 such that a(n) == A048675(n) (mod 3).
%C A332823 Completely additive modulo 3.
%C A332823 The equivalent sequence modulo 2 is A096268 (with offset 1), which produces the {A003159, A036554} classification.
%C A332823 Let H be the multiplicative subgroup of the positive rational numbers generated by the products of two consecutive primes and the cubes of primes. a(n) indicates the coset of H containing n. a(n) = 0 if n is in H. a(n) = 1 if n is in 2H. a(n) = -1 if n is in (1/2)H.
%C A332823 The properties of this classification can usefully be compared to two well-studied classifications. With the {A026424, A028260} classes, multiplying a member of one class by a prime gives a member of the other class. With the {A000028, A000379} classes, adding a factor to the Fermi-Dirac factorization of a member of one class gives a member of the other class. So, if 4 is not a Fermi-Dirac factor of k, k and 4k will be in different classes of the {A000028, A000379} set; but k and 4k will be in the same class of the {A026424, A028260} set. For two numbers to necessarily be in different classes when they differ in either of the 2 ways described above, 3 classes are needed.
%C A332823 With the classes defined by this sequence, no two of k, 2k and 4k are in the same class. This is a consequence of the following stronger property: if k is any positive integer and m is a member of A050376 (often called Fermi-Dirac primes), then no two of k, k * m, k * m^2 are in the same class. Also, if p and q are consecutive primes, then k * p and k * q are in different classes.
%C A332823 Further properties are given in the sequences that list the classes: A332820, A332821, A332822.
%C A332823 The scaled imaginary part of the Eisenstein integer-valued function, f, defined in A353445. - _Peter Munn_, Apr 27 2022
