%N A332234 Least integer t such that every binary word of length t+1 contains a reversed split occurrence of an n-overlap.
%C A332234 An "n-overlap" is a word of the form xxx', where x is a nonempty word of length at least n, and x' is a prefix of x of length n.  Thus, for example, abcdabcdab is a 2-overlap.  A reversed split occurrence of a pattern p is a word of the form xyz where zx matches the pattern.
%C A332234 For n = 0,1,2,3 words achieving the bound a(n) are as follows:
%C A332234 n = 0: 01
%C A332234 n = 1: 0011
%C A332234 n = 2: 010001100111001
%C A332234 n = 3: 0010100110100011111000111010000011101010001100
