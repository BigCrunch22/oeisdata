%N A332071 Lexicographically earliest sequence with a(n) odd terms among the first a(n+1) terms, for any n; a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2.
%C A332071 Without the requirement a(2) = 2 (or: increasing, or: without repeated terms), the trivial sequence (1, 1, 1, ...) = A000012 would also satisfy the definition, repeatedly stating that the first term is odd, ignoring all other terms. But a(2) - a(1) > 0 implies that the sequence will be strictly increasing throughout, and therefore make infinitely many nontrivial statements concerning all of its terms.
%C A332071 The formula comes from the fact that if we have a(n-1) odd terms among the first a(n) terms, and we need a(n) odd terms among the first a(n+1) terms, then we must use exactly a(n) - a(n-1) odd terms after the a(n)-th terms up to and including the a(n+1)-th terms, whence a(n+1) >= a(n) + a(n) - a(n-1).
%C A332071 Inspired by _Eric Angelini_'s variant based on digits, cf. LINKS.
%C A332071 First differences are: 1*2, 2*1, 3*4, 4*12, 5*2, 6*47, 7*2, 8*9, 9*2, 10*281, 11*2, 12*13, 13*2, 14*71, 15*2, 16*17, 17*2, 18*..., where a*b means that a is repeated b times (i.e., the gap of 10 appears 281 times in a row).

%F A332071 a(n+1) >= 2*a(n) - a(n-1) for all n > 1, with equality for n not in {3, 4, 8, 20, 22, 69, 71, 80, 82, ...}.
%e A332071 There is a(1) = 1 odd term, namely: 1, among the first a(2) = 2 terms which are 1 and 2.
%e A332071 There are 2 odd terms, 1 and 3, among the first a(3) = 3 terms, 1, 2 and 3.
%e A332071 Then there must be a(3) = 3 odd terms among the first a(4) terms. Since there are only 2 odd terms coming earlier, there must come at least 1 more odd terms. This excludes a(4) = 4, but makes the next smaller choice a(4) = 5 possible, provided it will be followed by an even term in order to satisfy the requirement that there be exactly 3 odd terms among the first 5 terms.
%e A332071 Knowing that a(5) must be even (see just above), and that a(5) >= 2 a(4) - a(3) = 7 (see formula, explained in comments), we have as smallest possibility a(5) = 8, which does not raise a contradiction.
%e A332071 Then again we can use a(6) = 2*8 - 5 = 11, least possibility according to the formula, and indeed not yet leading to a contradiction.
%e A332071 Then again a(7) = 2*11 - 8 = 14 does not raise a contradiction, nor does a(8) = 2*14 - 11 = 17, since we can see that it will be possible to have 11 odd terms among the first 14, and 14 odd terms among the first 17.
%e A332071 However, for a(9) >=  2*17 - 14 = 20 we see that 20 would not make it possible to satisfy the requirement of 8 odd terms among the first 11. Indeed, we have only 5 odd terms so far, so all of a(9), a(10) and a(11) must be odd. So the smallest possibility is a(9) = 20.
%e A332071 And so on.
