%N A069581 Triangle T(m,n) giving number of unit fractions (with odd denominators) needed to represent m/n, rational (n odd), using the greedy algorithm.
%C A069581 If m/n, a rational number (n odd) is expressed as sum (1/xi), where the xi are successively chosen to be the least possible odd integers which leave a nonnegative remainder, is the sum always finite? My conjecture: odd m needs odd, even m needs even unit fractions. In the triangle: rows are the (odd) denominators, columns are 1<m<n numerators.
