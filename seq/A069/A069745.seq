%N A069745 Expansion of 1/((1-x^2)(1-x^3)(1-x^6)(1-x^7)(1-x^8)).
%C A069745 Number of ways for a team to score n points in American football, where, except as noted below, order of scoring does not matter. Points can be scored as follows: 2 points for a safety (S), 3 points for a field goal (FG), 6 points for a touchdown (TD), 7 points for a touchdown followed by the point-after-touchdown (TD+PAT), 8 points for a touchdown followed by the 2-point-conversion (TD+2PC).
%C A069745 Touchdowns, field goals and safeties are scored independently of each other. Note, though, that a lone point cannot be scored unless a touchdown has just been scored by the same team. Similarly, a 2-point-conversion can only follow a touchdown. If these two restrictions were not part of the rules, then the U.S.A. football score sequence would be given instead by A069183 (with independent 1 and two independent types of 2s).
%C A069745 Also number of (unordered) ways of making change for n cents with coins of sizes 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8 cents.

%e A069745 a(14)=11: Here are the 11 ways that 14 points can be scored (although some scenarios, especially involving safeties, are unlikely in actual games): TD+PAT+TD+PAT ((6+1)+(6+1)), TD+TD+S (6+6+2), TD+TD+2PC (6+(6+2)), TD+FG+FG+S (6+3+3+2), TD+2PC+FG+FG ((6+2)+3+3), TD+PAT+FG+S+S ((6+1)+3+2+2), TD+2PC+S+S+S ((6+2)+2+2+2), TD+S+S+S+S (6+2+2+2+2), FG+FG+FG+FG+S (3+3+3+3+2), FG+FG+S+S+S+S (3+3+2+2+2+2) and S+S+S+S+S+S+S (2+2+2+2+2+2+2).
