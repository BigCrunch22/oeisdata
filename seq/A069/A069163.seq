%N A069163 Number of symmetric primes between n^2 and (n+2)^2. Two primes are termed symmetric in n^2 to (n+2)^2 if there is a k < 2n such that mid-k and mid+k are both prime, where mid =n(n+2).
%C A069163 This relates primes between n^2 and (n+1)^2 to primes between (n+1)^2 and (n+2)^2. It appears that the number of symmetric primes is zero for only n=0,32,41.

%e A069163 a(5) = 1 because in the range 25 to 49, the primes 29 and 41 are the only primes symmetric about the number 35.
