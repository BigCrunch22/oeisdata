%N A069527 Smallest multiple of n with digit sum = 8, or 0 if no such number exists, e.g. a(3k)= 0.
%C A069527 The number ABCDEF (A through F are digits) is divisible by 37 if the number XYZ (where X=A+D, Y=B+E, Z=C+F) is divisible by 37. If the digit sum of XYZ is S, then the digit sum of ABCDEF is S+9k for some k. A quick check of all multiples of 37 with three or fewer digits shows that none have a digit sum of 8. Thus no multiple of 37 has a digit sum of 8 and a(37) is undefined as is a(37p) for all p. - Christopher Lund (clund(AT)san.rr.com), Apr 16 2002
