%N A069571 Numbers n in which the k-th digit (counted from the right) is nonzero and is either a divisor of k (but not 1 in case k has a single-digit prime divisor) or a multiple of k, for all 1 <= k <= number of digits of n.
%C A069571 This is the subsequence of terms of A069570 with no digit 1 elsewhere than (possibly) in positions k with no prime divisor < 10, i.e., k = 1, 11, 13, 17, 19, ..., 11*11, 127, 131, 137, 139, 11*13, .... - _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 27 2016
%e A069571 54647 is a member but 14647 and 44647 are not members.
%e A069571 13 is a member of A069570 because both 1 and 3 are nonzero, further, 3 is divisible by n = 1 and 1 divides n = 2. 13 is not a member of this sequence because it has a single-digit multiple 3 > 1.
%e A069571 Numbers with "1" in place n = 1 may be in the sequence since 1 divides itself, and 1 does not exceed 1.
%e A069571 21 is a member of this sequence because the digits are nonzero, 1 divides n = 1 and 2 divides n = 2.
