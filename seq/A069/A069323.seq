%N A069323 Triangle in which n-th row gives ascending sequence of numbers derived from the (3x+1) problem, beginning with n. Numbers in one row share the same number of iteration steps required to reach the value of '1' when applying the (3x+1) algorithm. Each row terminates with a power of 2.
%C A069323 Provided that a number m will iterate to the number 1 by the (3x+1) algorithm, taking s steps and also provided that m is not a power of 2, then the sequence beginning with the number m will terminate at 2^s

%F A069323 A sequence begins with any positive integer. If a(n) = 2^k then the sequence terminates. a(n+1)=6.a(n) + 2^(k+1) where 2^k is derived from the formula a(n)=m.2^k, with m odd.
%e A069323 If a(1)=7 then a(2) = 6.7 + 2 =44 44 can be expressed as 11.2^2, therefore a(3) = 6.44 + 2^3 =272
