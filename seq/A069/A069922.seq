%N A069922 Number of primes p such that n^n <= p <= n^n + n^2.
%C A069922 Question: for any n>0, is there at least one prime p such that n^n <= p <= n^n + n^2? In this case, that would be stronger than the Schinzel conjecture: "for m > 1 there's at least one prime p such that m <= p <= m + log(m)^2" since n^2 < log(n^n)^2 = n^2*log(n)^2.
