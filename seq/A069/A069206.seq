%N A069206 Let m(n,k) be the sequence defined by m(n,1)=1, m(n,2)=n, m(n,k+2)=(m(n,k+1)+m(n,k))/2 if m(n,k+1)+m(n,k) is even, m(n,k+2)=m(n,k+1)-m(n,k) otherwise. Sequence gives the (experimentally unique) solution to m(n,x)=0 (for k > this solution m(n,k) is constant = +1 or -1 depending on n) or a(n)=0 if there is no solution (in this case the cycle (1,3,2,-1,-3,-2) is reached).
%C A069206 Sequence presents similarities with the 3x+1 problem but seems less "random". Hence this sequence presents regularities depending curiously on the number 7. If n==3 (mod 7) there is no solution to m(n,x)=0. If n==0,1,2,4,5 or 6 (mod 7) there is always a unique solution to m(n,x)=0. It seems also that lim_{n->infinity} a(n)/n = 0 (a(10^10)=493) and asymptotically, Sum_{i=1..n} a(i) ~ C*n*(log(n))^2 with C=1.7....

%F A069206 Values of m(7, k) for k = 1..24: 1, 7, 4, -3, -7, -5, -6, -1, 5, 2, -3, -5, -4, 1, 5, 3, 4, 1, -3, -1, -2, -1, 1, 0, hence a(7)=24. For k > 22, m(7, k) = -1.
