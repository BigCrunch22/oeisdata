%N A361615 a(n) is the smallest 5-rough number with exactly n divisors.
%e A361615 a(1) = 1 (which is the only number with exactly 1 divisor).
%e A361615 a(2) = 5 (since 5 is the smallest prime that is 5-rough).
%e A361615 a(3) = 25 (since 5 is the smallest number that is the square of a 5-rough prime).
%e A361615 a(4) = 35 (since a number with 4 divisors must be either the cube of a prime or the product of two distinct primes, and the smallest 5-rough numbers of these two types are 5^3 = 125 and 5*7 = 35, respectively, and 35 is the smaller of the two).
