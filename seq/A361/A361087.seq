%N A361087 Maximum squared inverse distance from the origin to the hyperplane defined by hypercube points.
%C A361087 Because it is not known if the squared inverse distances are always integers, this is a sequence of numerators (and the known corresponding denominators are all 1). The next two terms are conjectured to be 59 and 203 (distinct from sequences already in the OEIS).
%F A361087 a(n) = max_(m in M_n) ||m^(-1) e||^2, where M_n is the set of n X n nonsingular matrices with -1/+1 elements and e is the vector of all 1's.
