%N A361453 Number of colorings of the n X n knight graph up to permutation of the colors.
%C A361453 Any number of colors may be used.
%C A361453 Equivalently, a(n) is the number of stable partitions of the n X n knight graph. A stable partition is a partition of the vertices into sets so that no two vertices in a set are adjacent in the graph.

%F A361453 a(n) <= A000110(n^2).
%e A361453 a(2) = 15 = A000110(4) because the graph has no edges and so there are no restrictions on how the vertices may be colored (or equivalently the vertices partitioned into sets).
%Y A361453 Main diagonal of A208001.
