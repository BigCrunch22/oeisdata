%N A361133 a(n) = n for n <= 3. Let h, i, j represent a(n-3), a(n-2), a(n-1) respectively. For n > 3, if there is a symmetric difference in the sets of distinct primes dividing h and j, with greatest member p then a(n) is the least novel multiple of p. Otherwise, a(n) is the least novel k such that (k,i) > 1.
%C A361133 In other words if there are primes p which divide h but not j or primes q which divide j but not h then a(n) is the least novel multiple of the greatest of all such primes p, q. If there are no such primes (rad(h) = rad(j)), then a(n) is the least unused number sharing a divisor with i.
%C A361133 When an odd prime p appears it is immediately preceded and followed by multiples m*p and r*p of p respectively, thus m*p, p, r*p where if m = 2 then b is 3, and m > 2 forces r = 2 (compare with A064413 where m = 2, and r = 3  throughout).
%C A361133 The scatterplot resembles a fine-toothed comb, wherein it seems that the "teeth" represent consecutive multiples of certain distinct primes, which become compacted closer and closer together as the sequence progresses.
%C A361133 Conjectured to be a permutation of the natural numbers, with primes in natural order.

%e A361133 a(4) = 6 because the symmetric difference for 1 and 3 contains only one prime (3) and 6 is the least multiple of 3 that has not occurred already.
%e A361133 a(5) = 9 since h,j = 2,6 with difference 3, and 9 is the least novel multiple of 3.
%e A361133 a(6) = 4 since h,i,j = 3,6,9 (3,9 have no symmetric difference), and 4 is least novel number sharing a divisor with i = 6.
