%N A361192 Number of intersections of a grid and (growing) circle with center at a lattice point.
%C A361192 Counted intersections are intersections of the circumference of a circle and the grid (all the grid lines together). Beginning with the smallest circle, the radius is increasing, and a new term is added only when the number of intersections changes.
%F A361192 a(n) is a multiple of 4 for all n except 1.
%e A361192 a(1)=1 because at the beginning it's just a point. If we start increasing the circle, there would be 4 intersections, so a(2)=4, this holds while the radius is between 0 and 1 (assuming the cells of the grid have side length 1). If the radius is between 1 and sqrt(2), there are 12 intersections, so a(3)=12. After that: r=sqrt(2), a(4)=8; sqrt(2) < r < 2, a(5)=12.
%e A361192 The number of intersections changes when the squared radius reaches a sum of two nonzero squares (A000404) and when it starts exceeding a sum of two squares, so in the latter case there are three consecutive terms of the sequence corresponding to the squared radius smaller than a term of A001481, equal to it, and exceeding it, like a(3)-a(5) in the example above.
