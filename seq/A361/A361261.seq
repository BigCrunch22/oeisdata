%N A361261 Array of Ramsey core number rc(s,t) read by antidiagonals.
%C A361261 The Ramsey core number rc(s,t) is the smallest n such that for all edge 2-colorings of K_n, either the factor induced by the first color contains an s-core or the second factor contains a t-core. (A k-core is a subgraph with minimum degree at least k.)

%F A361261 rc(s,t) = ceiling(s + t - 3/2 + sqrt(2*(s-1)*(t-1) + 9/4)).
%e A361261 For order 5, one of the two factors has at least 5 edges, and so contains a cycle. For order 4, K_4 decomposes into two paths. Thus rc(2,2) = 5.
