%N A361135 The number of unlabeled connected fairly 4-regular multigraphs of order n, loops allowed.
%C A361135 Edges are undirected, vertices not labeled. "Fairly" means that each vertex has degree 4, but two of these edges do not connect to a second vertex; they are "fins" in CAD speak or "half-edges" in perturbation theory. The two fins may be attached to the same or to two different nodes. In the usual mathematical nomenclature these are connected graphs of order n+2 with two vertices of degree 1 and n vertices of degree 4, loops allowed.
