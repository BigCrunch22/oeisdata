%N A361135 The number of unlabeled connected fairly 4-regular multigraphs of order n, loops allowed.
%C A361135 Edges are undirected, vertices not labeled. "Fairly" means that each vertex has degree 4, but two of these edges do not connect to a second vertex; they are fins in CAD speak or half-edges in perturbation theory. The two "fins" may be attached to the same or to two different nodes. In the usual mathematical nomenclature these are connected graphs of order n+2 with two vertices of degree 1 and all other vertices of degree 4, loops allowed.
%C A361135 Probably related to A342173 but the criteria in A342173 are not clear. A342173 seems to allow graphs with more than 1 component, but this would lead to 1, 4, 14, 54, 213, 928,... Counting the cases with fins attached to a single or to two different vertices separately seems not to explain the difference between the two sequences.
