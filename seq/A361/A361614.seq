%N A361614 Set a(1)=0 and a(2)=1. For n > 1, if a(n) has already appeared in the sequence, then a(n+1) = number of steps since its first appearance. If a(n) has not appeared before, search instead for a(n)-1, then a(n)-2, etc., until you find a number that has appeared before.
%C A361614 The first 32 terms are distributed chaotically, after which the sequence alternates between 2 and n-6 indefinitely.
%H A361614 <a href="/index/Rec#order_04">Index entries for linear recurrences with constant coefficients</a>, signature (0,2,0,-1).
%e A361614 We start with a(1) = 0 and a(2) = 1. 1 has not appeared before, so we search for the greatest valid integer less than 1, which in this case is 0. 0 first occurred at a(1), which is 1 term before a(2) so a(3) = 1.
%e A361614 1 first occurred 1 term before, so a(4) = 1.
%e A361614 1 appeared at term a(1), which is 2 terms before a(4), so a(5) = 2.
%e A361614 2 has not appeared before, so we search for 1, which occurred 3 terms before at a(1). a(6) = 3.
%e A361614 And so on.
