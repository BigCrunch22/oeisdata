%N A361365 a(n) is the minimum possible sum of 2*n distinct positive numbers in a set, arranged in two subsets of size n each, such that the sum of any one element in each of the two subsets is a prime number.
%C A361365 Imagine a safe combination lock that has two independently rotating concentric number dials. The simplest model has just n = 1 number on each of its dials and one alignment position for those two numbers on them, allowing a single possible setting. But on the more advanced models there are n = 2, n = 3, and so on equally spaced numbers for each dial. All the numbers are different on a model, and when its dials are set in any combination, then every two numbers aligned will add up to a prime number. Necessarily, the numbers on one dial are all odd and on the other all even.
%C A361365 More than one set may correspond to some a(n), as is the case of a(4).
%C A361365 Any set corresponding to the n-th term is a partition of the term with 2*n distinct parts.
%C A361365 The procedure described in A162662 may aid the construction of candidate sets here, though their sums seem much greater than the minimum.

%e A361365 a(1) = 3, the minimum possible sum of two distinct numbers in the set. These add up to 3, which is a prime.
%e A361365          1          2
%e A361365 a(2) = 10, the least possible sum of four distinct numbers in the set. Any number from the first column added to any number in the second, gives a prime number. There are 2^2 = 4 possibilities, e.g., 1 + 4 = 5, or 3 + 4 = 7, and so on.

%e A361365 a(3) = 29, the minimum possible sum of six distinct numbers in the set. Any number in the first column added to any number in the second, results in a prime number. There are 3^2 = 9 possibilities, e.g., 1 + 10 = 11, or 9 + 4 = 13, and so on.

%e A361365 a(4) = 90 is attained in two different ways,
%e A361365     sets     {1,5,11,17}  {2,6,12,36}
%e A361365     or sets  {1,5,11,35}  {2,6,12,18}
