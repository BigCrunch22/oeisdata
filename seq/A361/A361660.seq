%N A361660 Irregular triangle read by rows where row n lists the successive numbers moved in the process of forming row n of the triangle A361642.
%C A361660 The first and last numbers in row n>=2 are n and 2, respectively, and they occur just once each in the row.
%C A361660 For row n>=3, and if and only if n-1 is prime, numbers n and 2 are the only numbers which occur just once (since when n-1 is prime it cannot make a rectangle for any other number to move from the initial column to the final row).
%C A361660 A number can move twice in succession, and so occur here twice in succession, when it fills the top right corner cell in a rectangle of width * height = n.
%C A361660 The move is from the initial column to top right corner cell, and therefore the numbers which appear twice in succession are d+1 for each divisor d of n, in the range 1 < d < n.
%C A361660 If n is a prime, then it has no such divisors, or if n is a semiprime n = x*y (including square of a prime) then x+1 and y+1 are the only numbers appearing twice in succession.
%C A361660 The length of row n is A002541(n). This equals to the number of special integer partitions of n there. Where a rectangle is formed of the changing shape, the row length increases more because the movement of a number that completes the rectangle is repeated as it continues to move again.

%e A361660 The parallel is shown for row length and the special integer partition in A002541:
%e A361660 For n = 4, its row consists of 4, 3, 3 and 2, that is four elements.
%e A361660 The special partition of n = 4 is (4), (2 2), (3 1), and (2 1 1), that is also four partitions. The relation is demonstrated by the illustration below. Square blocks represent the four numbers. As they move, the changing shape assumes a number of identical or reflected formations. The number of possible grouping of the blocks within them is exactly the same as the number of the moves that the blocks undergo:
