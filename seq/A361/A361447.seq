%N A361447 Number of connected 3-regular (cubic) multigraphs on 2n unlabeled nodes rooted at an unoriented edge (or loop) whose removal does not disconnect the graph, loops allowed.
%C A361447 a(0) = 1 by convention. Loops add two to the degree of a node.
%C A361447 Instead of a rooted edge, the graph can be considered to have a pair of external legs (or half-edges). The external legs add 1 to the degree of a node, but do not contribute to the connectivity of the graph.
%C A361447 The 4-regular version of this sequence is A361135 since removing a single edge from a connected even degree regular graph cannot disconnect the graph.
%F A361447 G.f.: B(x) - x*(B(x)^2 + B(x^2))/2 where B(x) is the g.f. of A361412.
%e A361447 The illustrations in A352175 by _R. J. Mathar_ show 1, 2, 9, and 49 connected graphs corresponding to the initial terms of this sequence.
