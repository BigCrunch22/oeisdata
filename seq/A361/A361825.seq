%N A361825 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not yet appeared that is a multiple of the smallest prime that does not divide a(n-2) + a(n-1).
%C A361825 The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers, although it takes many terms for the primes to appear, e.g., a(191443) = 19.
%H A361825 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A361825/a361825.png">Image of the first 50000 terms</a>. The green line is a(n) = n.
%e A361825 a(3) = 4 as a(1) + a(2) = 1 + 2 = 3 which does not contain 2 as a prime factor, and 4 is the smallest unused number that is a multiple of 2.
%e A361825 a(4) = 5 as a(2) + a(3) = 2 + 4 = 6 = 2*3 which does not contain 5 as a prime factor, and 5 is the smallest unused number that is a multiple of 5.
