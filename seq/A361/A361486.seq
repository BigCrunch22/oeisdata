%N A361486 Lexicographically earliest sequence  of positive numbers on a square spiral such that no three equal numbers are collinear.
%C A361486 The first term a(1) = 1 lies at the (0,0) origin while all other terms lie on integer coordinates.

%e A361486 a(5) = 2 as a(3) = 1 and a(4) = 1 lie on the horizontal line y = 1 relative to the starting square (assuming a counter-clockwise spiral) so a(5) cannot be 1.
%e A361486 a(7) = 3 as a(5) = 2 and a(6) = 2 lie on the vertical line x = -1 so a(7) cannot be 2, while a(1) = 1 and a(3) = 1 lie on the line y = x so a(7) cannot be 1.
%e A361486 a(21) = 4 as a(18) = 3 and a(19) = 3 lie on the line x = -2, a(6) = 2 and a(15) = 2 lie on the line y = 2*x + 2, while a(1) = 1 and a(3) = 1 lie on the line y = x, so a(21) cannot be 1, 2 or 3.
