%F A361871 a(n) = 2*n for n >= 3.
%F A361871 Proof: By Lagrange's theorem in group theory we have that n divides a(n) for all n. A group of order n and with an element of order n is the cyclic group of order n, hence being abelian. On the other hand, the dihedral group D_{2n} is non-abelian for n >= 3 and contains an element of order n. - _Jianing Song_, Aug 11 2023
