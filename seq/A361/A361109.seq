Sloane, <a href="/A360519/a360519.pdf">Table showing A360519(1)-A360519(13)</a>, also the smallest missing number (smn, A361109 and A361110), binary vectors showing which terms are divisible by the primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11; and phi, a decimal representation of those binary vectors (A361111). This sequence forms the third row of the table.
%e A361109 After we have calculated A360519(4) = 35, the smallest term of C that is missing from A360519 is 12, so a(4) = 12.
