%N A361905 Numbers k for which sqrt(k/2) divides k and the width at the diagonal of the symmetric representation of sigma(k) equals 1.
%C A361905 Every number in this sequence has the form 2^(2*i + 1) * k^(2*j), i, j >= 0, k >= 1.
%C A361905 The number of 1's in row a(n) of the triangle in A237048 as well as the length of that row are odd.
%F A361905 a(n) = k when A001105(n) = k and A320137(k) = 1.
%e A361905 a(4) = 32 has 4 as its single middle divisor, and its symmetric representation of sigma consists of one part of width 1.
%e A361905 a(5) = 50 has 5 as its single middle divisor, and its symmetric representation of sigma consists of three parts of width 1.
%e A361905 a(9) = 200 = 2^3 * 5^2 has 10 = 2 * 5 as its single middle divisor, and its symmetric representation of sigma consists of one part of maximum width 2 (A250068), but has width 1 at the diagonal.
%e A361905 a(39) = 6050 = 2^1 * 5^2 * 11^2 has 55 as its single middle divisor; it is the first number in the sequence whose symmetric representation of sigma consists of 3 parts and its central part has maximum width 2, but has width 1 at the diagonal.
