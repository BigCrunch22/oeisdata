%N A361702 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive numbers on a square spiral such that no four equal numbers lie on the circumference of a circle.
%C A361702 The first term a(1) = 1 lies at the (0,0) origin while all other terms lie on integer coordinates.

%e A361702 a(4) = 2 as a(1) = a(2) = a(3) = 1 all lie on the circumference of a circle with radius 1/sqrt(2) centered at (1/2,1/2), assuming a counter-clockwise spiral, so a(4) cannot be 1.
%e A361702 a(12) = 3 as a(2) = a(3) = a(11) = 1 all lie on the circumference of a circle with radius 1/sqrt(2) centered at (3/2,1/2), so a(12) cannot be 1, while a(4) = a(8) = a(10) = 2 all lie on the circumference of a circle with radius sqrt(2) centered at (1,0), so a(12) cannot be 2.
%e A361702 a(22) = 4 as a(1) = a(2) = a(7) = 1 all lie on the circumference of a circle with radius sqrt(10)/2 centered at (1/2,-3/2), so a(22) cannot be 1, a(6) = a(19) = a(21) = 2 all lie on the circumference of a circle with radius sqrt(5)/2 centered at (-3/2,-1), so a(22) cannot be 2, while a(12) = a(16) = a(20) = 3 all lie on the circumference of a circle with radius sqrt(5) centered at (0,0), so a(22) cannot be 3.
