%N A330443 Least m >= 0 such that (n+m)(n+m+1)/2 - n(n-3)/2 is prime, or -1 if no such m exists.
%C A330443 a(n) + 1 is the number of steps to reach a prime in the game described by Peter Luschny on the SeqFan list (cf. link): Start with n, then add n, n+1, n+2, ..., n+m until a prime is reached.
%C A330443 See A330501 for the resulting prime, A329946 for the primes never reached.
%C A330443 Among the first 200 terms a(0..199), there are 50 '1's, 49 '2's, 19 '3's and 19 '10's, and 17 '7's. Is there an explanation for the frequency of, e.g., 10?

%F A330443 a(n) = A330502(n) - n.
%e A330443 Starting with n = 0, add 0: sum = 0, not prime, then add 1: sum = 1, not prime, then add 2: sum = 3, a prime, so a(0) = 2.
%e A330443 Starting with n = 1, add 1: sum = 2, a prime, so a(1) = 2 - 2 = 0.
%e A330443 Starting with n = 2, add 2: sum = 4, not prime, then add 3: sum = 7, a prime, so a(2) = 3 - 2 = 1.
%e A330443 Starting with n = 3 = T(2) = 2(2+1)/2 (triangular number, cf. A000217), add 3 to get T(2) + 3 = T(3) = 6, then add 4 to get T(3) + 4 = T(4) = 10, and so on. A triangular number T(n) = n(n+1)/2 > 3 is never prime, since either product of n and (n+1)/2, or product of n/2 and n+1. So a(3) = -1.
