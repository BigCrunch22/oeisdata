%N A330961 For any n >= 0: consider all pairs of numbers (x, y) whose binary representations can be interleaved (or shuffled) to produce the binary representation of n (possibly with leading zeros); a(n) is the least possible value of abs(x - y).

%e A330961 For n = 5:
%e A330961 - the binary representation of 5 is "101",
%e A330961 - the possible values for (x, y), restricted to x >= y without loss of generality, are:
%e A330961   bin(5)   x  y  |x-y|
%e A330961   -------  -  -  -----
%e A330961   "101"    5  0      5
%e A330961   "1/01"   1  1      0
%e A330961   "10/1"   2  1      1
%e A330961   "1/0/1"  3  0      3
%e A330961 - hence a(5) = 0.
