%N A330119 Degrees-based analog to the Dottie number (A003957).
%C A330119 Using a calculator that has a cosine button and is set to calculate the values of trigonometric functions with the angles measured in degrees, start with any number and repeatedly hit the cosine button; the result will always converge to this value.
%C A330119 (If the calculator is set to calculate the values of trigonometric functions with the angles measured in radians rather than degrees, repeatedly hitting the cosine button will result in the value given at A003957.)
