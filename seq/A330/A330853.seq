%N A330853 First occurrences of gaps between primes 6k+1: gap sizes.
%C A330853 Contains A268925 as a subsequence.
%C A330853 Conjecture: the sequence is a permutation of all positive multiples of 6, i.e., all positive terms of A008588.
%C A330853 Conjecture: a(n) = O(n). See arXiv:2002.02115 (sect.7) for discussion.

%F A330853 a(n) = A330855(n) - A330854(n).
%e A330853 The first primes of the form 6k+1 are 7 and 13, so a(1)=13-7=6. The next prime 6k+1 is 19, and the gap 19-13=6 already occurred, so a new term is not added to the sequence. The next prime 6k+1 is 31, and the gap 31-19=12 is occurring for the first time; therefore a(2)=12.
