%N A330037 The sum of digits function modulo 2 of the natural numbers in base phi.
%C A330037 This sequence is a morphic sequence, i.e., a letter-to-letter image of a fixed point of a morphism.
%C A330037 Let the morphism tau on the alphabet A:={1,2,...,8} be defined by
%C A330037       tau(1) = 12, tau(2) = 312, tau(3) = 47, tau(4) = 8312,
%C A330037       tau(5) = 56, tau(6) = 756, tau(7) = 83, tau(8) = 4756.
%C A330037 Let lambda: A* -> {0,1} be the letter-to-letter morphism given by
%C A330037       lambda(1) = lambda(3) = lambda(6) = lambda(8) = 0;
%C A330037       lambda(2) = lambda(4) = lambda(5) = lambda(7) = 1.
%C A330037 Then a(n) = lambda(x(n)), where x(0)x(1)... = 123124712... is the fixed point of tau starting with 1. For a proof, see "The sum of digits function of the base phi expansion of the natural numbers".

%F A330037 a(n) = A055778(n) modulo 2.
%e A330037 In base phi: 2 = 10.01, so a(2)=0; 3 = 100.01 so a(3)=0.
%Y A330037 See A130600 for the integers written in base phi, with the "decimal point" omitted.  See A105424 for the part of n in base phi left of the decimal point.
