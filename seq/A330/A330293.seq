%N A330293 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) = the smallest prime divisor of the number formed by the concatenation of a(1) to a(n-1) that has not previously appeared in the sequence.
%C A330293 The next term a(36) requires the factorization of a composite 246 digit number 18604...12467.
%e A330293 a(3) = 3 as the concatenation of a(1) and a(2) = '12' and 3 is the smallest prime divisor of 12 that has not appeared in the sequence.
%e A330293 a(4) = 41 as the concatenation of a(1)..a(3) is '123' and 41 is the smallest prime divisor of 123 which has not appeared in the sequence. Note that 3 also divides 123 but a(3) = 3.
%e A330293 a(6) = 653 as the concatenation of a(1)..a(5) is '123417' and 653 is the smallest prime divisor of 123417 has not appeared in the sequence. Note that 9 also divides 123417 and has not appeared but only prime divisors are considered.
