%N A330545 a(1) = 2; thereafter a(n) = a(n-1) + (-1)^(n + 1)*(prime(n) - prime(n - 1) - 1)  (where prime(k) denotes the k-th prime).
%C A330545 a(n) is the column of the Boustrophedon triangle in A330339 that contains prime(n).
%C A330545 If a(n) = 0 then p = prime(n) is a term of A330339, and n is a term of A330546.
%C A330545 Since this has a simple recurrence, it is the key to understanding A330339. However, note that this sequence in turn can be simply expressed in terms of the classic sequence A008347:
%C A330545    a(n) = prime(n) + 1 - 2 * A008347(n) if n is even,
%C A330545    a(n) = 2 * A008347(n) - prime(n) if n is odd.
%C A330545 The sequence that ties all these sequences together is A330547 (q.v.).
%C A330545 First negative term is a(146) = -2.
%C A330545 Note on the links: The illustrations from Angelini and Trump show all the terms 0,1,2,3,4,... (as in A330339), while those of Havermann, Sloane, and Stevenson just show the primes.
%C A330545 The column number mod 4 uniquely determines the residue class of primes mod 4 in that column. If the column number is 0,1,2,3 mod 4 then the primes in that column are 1,3,3,1 respectively (see the "Notes" link). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 04 2020
%C A330545 For large n, the graphs of A330545 and A330547 are essentially identical.
%C A330545 Based on the first 10^12 terms, it appears that lim sup |a(n)| is about n^(2/3). This estimate is based on the plots below by Sloane, Trump (the first plot), Havermann (the first plot), and Stevenson (all three plots). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 21 2020
