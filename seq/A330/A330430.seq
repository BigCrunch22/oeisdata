%N A330430 Consider integers k=0,1,2,... as strings. Compare each digit in the string, in left-to-right order, with the contents of a bag (multiset) of digits, which is initially empty. If digit d is in the bag delete d from both the string and the bag. What remains of any nonempty string is appended to the sequence and its digits are added to the bag.

%e A330430 Beginning with k=0, the bag is initially empty and 0 matches nothing in the bag, so the sequence is extended and 0 is added to the bag.  Likewise, for k=1-9, none of these digits match anything in the bag, resulting in the sequence [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] and a bag that contains {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.
%e A330430 With k=10, Both the 1 and the 0 in k are matched with the 1 and the 0 in the bag and cancel out.  This leaves an empty string, so the sequence is not extended, and the bag now contains {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.
%e A330430 With k=11, neither digit cancels out, since there are no ones in the bag, so the sequence is extended, [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11], and the bag contains {1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.
