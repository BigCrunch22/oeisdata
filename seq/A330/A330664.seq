%N A330664 Number of non-isomorphic balanced reduced multisystems of maximum depth whose degrees (atom multiplicities) are the weakly decreasing prime indices of n.
%C A330664 A balanced reduced multisystem is either a finite multiset, or a multiset partition with at least two parts, not all of which are singletons, of a balanced reduced multisystem.
%C A330664 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. The multiset of prime indices of n is row n of A112798. A multiset whose multiplicities are the prime indices of n (such as row n of A305936) is generally not the same as the multiset of prime indices of n. For example, the prime indices of 12 are {1,1,2}, while a multiset whose multiplicities are {1,1,2} is {1,1,2,3}.
%F A330664 For n > 1, a(2^n) = a(prime(n)) = A000111(n - 1).
%e A330664 Non-isomorphic representatives of the a(n) multisystems for n = 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 12 (commas and outer brackets elided):

%Y A330664 The non-maximal version is A330666.
%Y A330664 The case of constant or strict atoms is A000111.
%Y A330664 Labeled versions are A330728, A330665 (prime indices), and A330675 (strongly normal).
%Y A330664 Non-isomorphic multiset partitions whose degrees are the prime indices of n are A318285.
