%N A330724 Sum of prime factors (with multiplicity) of the n-th composite number coprime to 6.
%C A330724 It appears that odd numbers appear rarely in this sequence. I conjecture that all the odd numbers above 15 and all the even numbers above 10 will at least once show up in the sequence.
%C A330724 From _Cara Bennett_, Dec 29 2019: (Start)
%C A330724 Every combination of prime numbers >= 5 when summed will be in this sequence (e.g., 5 + 5 = 10, 5 + 7 = 12, 7 + 7 = 14, ...). As long as the numbers 15 through 19 can be written as the sum of 2 or more prime numbers >= 5, then we can write any integer >= 15 in this form simply by adding fives to either 15, 16, 17, 18, or 19. Note that we can do this: 5 + 5 + 5 = 15; 5 + 11 = 16; 5 + 5 + 7 = 17; 5 + 13 = 18; 5 + 7 + 7 = 19.
%C A330724 For example, if we wanted to show that 330724 will appear in the sequence, we can write 330724 as the sum 330705 + 19 = (5 + 5 + ... + 5) + 5 + 7 + 7. The product (5 * 5 * ... * 5) * (5 * 7 * 7) is a composite number coprime to 6. Hence, 330724 must be in the sequence. (End)

%e A330724 The first composite number in the referenced sequence is 25. The prime factorization of 25 is 5^2 or 5*5. The sum of these prime factors is 10. Therefore a(1) = 10.
