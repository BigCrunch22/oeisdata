%N A330639 A "Fractal Jump Sequence" (FJS) that reappears twice (itself and itself*2; see the Comments section).
%C A330639 Start on a(1) = 1 and underline it;
%C A330639 from there, jump over 1 term to the right; you land on a(3) = 2, which you underline;
%C A330639 from there, jump over 2 terms to the right; you'll land on a(6) = 2, which you underline;
%C A330639 from there, jump over 2 terms to the right; you'll land on a(9) = 4, which you underline;
%C A330639 from there, jump over 4 terms to the right; you'll land on a(14) = 4, which you underline;
%C A330639 from there, jump over 4 terms to the right; you'll land on a(19) = 2, which you underline; etc.
%C A330639 The underlined terms reproduce the starting sequence. The not underlined terms are the successive terms of the starting sequence multiplied by 2.
%Y A330639 Cf. A105496 (adding 1 instead of multiplying by 2 the non-underlined terms).
