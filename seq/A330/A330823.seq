%N A330823 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) = a(n-1) - n if n is prime, otherwise a(n) = a(n-1) + floor(n/(log(n)-1)).
%C A330823 The Prime Number Theorem shows that the probability of a random number not greater than x being prime is approximately 1/log(x), therefore the probability of a number being composite in the same range is approximately (log(x)-1)/log(x). As this sequence subtracts n from the previous term if n is prime, or adds n with a weighting of 1/(log(n)-1) if n is composite, its expected value as n goes to infinity is approximately n*(1/(log(n)-1))*((log(n)-1)/log(n)) - n*(1/log(n)) = 0. We therefore expect that a(n)/n approaches 0 as n goes to infinity.
%C A330823 In the first 2 million terms the sequence changes sign 1900 times, has a maximum positive value of 160213275 at a(1772200), and a maximum negative value of -29535301 at a(1513751). The majority of terms are positive. See the image link below.
