%N A330307 Number of circular ternary words of length n having the maximum possible number of distinct blocks of length floor(log_3 n) and floor(log_3 n)+1.
%C A330307 A circular word (a.k.a. "necklace") can be viewed as a representative of the equivalence class under cyclic shift.
%C A330307 The words counted by this sequence have 3^i distinct blocks of length i = floor(log_3 n) and n distinct blocks of length i+1.
%C A330307 This sequence counts a certain natural generalization of ternary de Bruijn words, which are cyclic words of length 3^n containing all n-length blocks as subwords.
