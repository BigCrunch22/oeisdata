%N A330877 Number of steps needed to reach zero or a cycle when starting from k = n and repeatedly applying the map that replaces k by k - d(k) if k is even, by k + d(k) if k is odd, where d(k) is the number of divisors of k (A000005).
%C A330877 First cycle we see for n = 83. The length of the cycle is 38 steps. To reach a cycle means the time to first step into the loop.
%e A330877 n = 1, mapping steps are 1 + 1 = 2, 2 - 2 = 0, a(1) = 2;
%e A330877 n = 2, mapping steps are 2 - 2 = 0, a(2) = 1;
%e A330877 n = 3, mapping steps are 3 + 2 = 5, 5 + 2 = 7, 7 + 2 = 9, 9 + 3 = 12, 12 - 6 = 6, 6 - 4 = 2, 2 - 2 = 0, a(3) = 7;
%e A330877 n = 4, mapping steps are 4 - 3 = 1, 1 + 1 = 2, 2 - 2 = 0, a(4) = 3;
%e A330877 n = 5, mapping steps are 5 + 2 = 7, 7 + 2 = 9, 9 + 3 = 12, 12 - 6 = 6, 6 - 4 = 2, 2 - 2 = 0, a(5) = 6.
