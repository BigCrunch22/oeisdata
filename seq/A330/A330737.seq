%N A330737 a(n) is the first index k in A002182 (highly composite numbers) from which onward all terms A002182(i), i >= k, are multiples of the n-th prime, a(0) = 1 by convention.
%C A330737 Equivalently, a(n) is the first index k in A002182 from which onward all terms A002182(i), i >= k, are multiples of A002110(n), the n-th primorial number.
%C A330737 Question: Is this sequence well-defined for any n > 1? For all n? See also A199337.
%C A330737 Note that this differs from A072846 at n = 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, ...
%C A330737 Yes, the sequence is well defined for all n, see A199337 for proof that all A002182(k) >= A329571(n)^2 are divisible by n.  - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 07 2020

%e A330737 a(0) = 1 as A002110(0) = 1, and A002182(1) = 1, and as all integers are divisible by 1, including all terms of A002182.
%e A330737 A002182(9) = 60, and because from then onward all highly composite numbers are multiples of 30 (= A002110(3) = prime(1)*prime(2)*prime(3)), we have a(3) = 9.
