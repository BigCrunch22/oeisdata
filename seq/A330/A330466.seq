%N A330466 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of parts in the partition of n into k consecutive parts that differ by 2, n >= 1, k >= 1, and the first element of column k is in row k^2.
%C A330466 Since the trivial partition n is counted, so T(n,1) = 1.
%C A330466 This is an irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k), n >= 1, k >= 1, in which column k lists k's interleaved with k-1 zeros, and the first element of column k is in row k^2.
%C A330466 Conjecture: row sums give A066839.
%F A330466 T(n,k) = k*A303300(n,k).

%e A330466 For n = 16 there are three partitions of 16 into consecutive parts that differ by 2, including 16 as a partition. They are [16], [9, 7] and [7, 5, 3, 1]. The number of parts of these partitions are 1, 2 and 4 respectively, so the 16th row of the triangle is [1, 2, 0, 4].
