%N A330591 Number of Collatz steps to reach 1 starting from 6^n + 1.
%C A330591 The Collatz transform maps any positive integer k to k/2 if k is even or 3*k+1 if k is odd. There is a famous unsolved problem which says that, starting with any positive integer k, repeated application of the Collatz transform will eventually reach 1 or equivalently enter the cycle (4,2,1).
%C A330591 This sequence is related to A179118 and A212653, which look at the stopping times of numbers of the form 2^n+1 and 3^n+1 respectively. We note that there exist several sequences of arithmetic progressions with common difference 1 in the former and with common difference -1 in the latter. This sequence looks at stopping times of numbers of the form 2^n*3^n+1 where we see that there exist arithmetic progressions with common difference 1+(-1)=0. This is an interesting result that requires further investigation.
%F A330591 a(n) = A006577(6^n+1).
%e A330591 a(2)=21 because the Collatz trajectory of 6^2 + 1 = 37 is

%e A330591   20 ->  10 ->  5 -> 16 ->  8 ->  4 ->  2 ->  1, which is 21 steps.
