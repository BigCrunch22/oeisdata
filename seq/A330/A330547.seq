%N A330547 a(1)=2; thereafter a(n) = a(n-1) + (-1)^(n+1)*(prime(n)-prime(n-1)) (where prime(k) denotes the k-th prime).
%C A330547 There are several equivalent definitions:
%C A330547 a(n) = (-1)^(n+1)*(prime(n) + 2*(Sum_{i=1..n-1} (-1)^i*prime(n-i)));
%C A330547 a(n) = (-1)^n*(prime(n) - 2*A008347(n)) for n >= 1;
%C A330547 a(n) = A330545(n) if n is odd, a(n) = A330545(n)-1 if n is even;
%C A330547 generating function = P(-x)*(x+1)/(x-1), where P(x) = 2*x + 3*x^2 + 5*x^3 + ... = Sum_{k>=1} prime(k)*x^k is the g.f. for the primes.
%C A330547 Note that the recurrence closely resembles that of A330545, but is slightly simpler. _Hans Havermann_'s graphs of A330545, linked here, also essentially apply to the present sequence.
%C A330547 This sequence ties together A330339, A330545, A008347, and the primes.
%C A330547 Just as A330545 describes the boustrophedon path that generates the "Boustrophedon Primes" in A330339, the present sequence can also be regarded as defining a boustrophedon path with a slightly different rule, as follows. Write the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, ... in a triangle on a square grid in the boustrophedon manner, ending a row when a prime is reached, and starting the next row in the opposite direction, but displaced by one square in that direction:

%C A330547 Since all primes>2 are odd, here the odd primes only appear in odd-number4d columns (and in particular there are no primes in column 0).
%C A330547 In fact the primes (other than 2) occur only in odd-numbered columns: primes congruent to 3 mod 4 occur in columns congruent to 1 mod 4, and primes congruent to 1 mod 4 occur in columns congruent to 3 mod 4. See the "Notes" link for proof. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 04 2020
%C A330547 It would be nice to know something about the asymptotic growth of this sequence. The usual estimates for the primes do not seem to produce anything useful.
%C A330547 For large n, the graphs of A330545 and A330547 are essentially identical.
%C A330547 Based on the first 10^12 terms, it appears that lim sup |a(n)| is about n^(2/3). This estimate is based on the plots given in A330545 by Sloane, Trump (the first plot), Havermann (the first plot), and Stevenson (all three plots).- _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 21 2020
%C A330547 Conjecture. Let k be an integer and X_k be the set of all n such that (-1)^n*a(n)=2k-1. If a, b are integers and a<>0, then X_k contains infinitely many terms of the arithmetic progression {a*n+b: n integer}. - _M. Farrokhi D. G._, Nov 12 2023
