%N A330712 Numbers k such that F(k) - 1 is divisible by floor((k - 1)/2), where F(k) is the k-th Fibonacci number (A000045).
%C A330712 Numbers of the form F(k) - 1 have the same Zeckendorf (A014417) and dual Zeckendorf (A104326) representations: alternating digits of 1 and 0 whose sum is floor((k - 1)/2). Thus, if k is in this sequence then F(k) - 1 is both a Zeckendorf-Niven number (A328208) and a lazy-Fibonacci-Niven number (A328212), i.e., A000071(a(n)) is in A330711.

%e A330712 7 is in this sequence since F(7) - 1 = 13 - 1 = 12 is divisible by floor((7 - 1)/2) = 3. The Zeckendorf and dual Zeckendorf representations of 7 are both 1010, whose sum of digits, 2, divides 12. Thus 12 is both a Zeckendorf-Niven number and a lazy-Fibonacci-Niven number.
