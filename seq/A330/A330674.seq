%N A330674 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct nonnegative terms such that a(n+1) is obtained by adding to a(n) the odd digits of a(n) and subtracting the even ones.
%C A330674 When an iteration reproduces a term already in the sequence, we cancel this iteration and restart the sequence from there with the smallest integer not yet present in the sequence.
%e A330674 As a(1) = 1, we get a(2) = 2 by adding the odd digit 1 to a(1);
%e A330674 as a(2) = 2, we  get a(3) = 0 by subtracting the even digit 2 from a(2);
%e A330674 as a(3) = 0, we stop to iterate (0 would produce 0, already in the sequence) and restart the sequence with a(4) = 3, the smallest integer not present;
%e A330674 as a(4) = 3, we get a(5) = 6 by adding the odd digit 3 to a(4);
%e A330674 as a(5) = 6, we stop to iterate (6-6 produces 0, already in the sequence) and restart the sequence with a(6) = 4, the smallest integer not present;
%e A330674 as a(6) = 4, we stop to iterate (4-4 produces 0, already in the sequence) and restart the sequence with a(7) = 5, the smallest integer not present;
%e A330674 as a(7) = 5, we get a(8) = 10 by adding the odd digit 5 to a(7);
%e A330674 as a(8) = 10, we get a(9) = 11 by adding the odd digit 1 to a(8);
%e A330674 as a(9) = 11, we get a(10) = 13 by adding the odd digits 1 and 1 to a(9); etc.
