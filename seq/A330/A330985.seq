%N A330985 Irregular table read by rows in which row n gives the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients for the square of the symmetric Schur function corresponding to the n-th partition listed in A036036 (colexicographic order).
%C A330985 Not only the rows but also the coefficients in each row are listed in one-to-one correspondence with the partitions as listed in the corresponding row of A036036.
%C A330985 The length of row n in this table equals A000041(2|lambda|), the number of partitions of 2|lambda|, where |lambda| is the sum of parts of the n-th partition listed in A036036. There are A000041(k) rows of length A000041(2k), k >= 1.
%C A330985 The graded colexicographic order is also known as "Abramovitz-Stegun" or better Hindenburg order, cf. Luschny link. (This is the lexicographic order of the partitions padded with '0's to length |lambda| and with parts in increasing order, see column "Ref Colex" on the OEIS Wiki page.)
%C A330985 To each partition lambda is associated a Schur polynomial s_lambda through Jacobi's bialternant formula. The Littlewood-Richardson coefficients are the structure constants in the ring of symmetric functions w.r.t. the basis of Schur functions, i.e., they are the coefficients of products s_mu*s_nu written as linear combinations of the Schur functions s_lambda of degree |lambda| = |mu| + |nu|. (To get this well-defined in terms of symmetric functions, we must consider the polynomials s_mu, s_nu also in |lambda| variables.) This table considers the diagonal of this multiplication table, corresponding to squares of Schur polynomial functions.
%C A330985 Sequence A067855 gives the sum of squares of the coefficients of Sum_{mu |- n} s_mu^2. This corresponds to taking the sum, as vectors, of rows of equal length (equivalent to equal |mu|), and then taking the Euclidean norm squared. For example, for mu |- 2 <=> |mu| = 2, take the sum of rows 2 and 3, to get (1, 1, 2, 1, 1), with sum of squares equal to 8 = A067855(2).
%C A330985 It is known that L-R coefficients for products of "rectangular" partitions contain only 0's and 1's (Okada 1998), therefore rows 5, 8, 10, ... are the first rows that may have terms > 1.

%F A330985 s_mu^2 = Sum_{k=1..A000041(2|mu|)} T(n,k)*s_{p(k,2|mu|)}, where mu is the n-th partition listed in A036036, p(k,2|mu|) is the k-th partition in row 2|mu| of A036036, and s_mu, s_p are the Schur functions (or polynomials in 2|mu| variables) associated to the partitions mu resp. p.
%e A330985 The 4th partition listed in A036036 is (1,2); the Schur function (s[1,2])^2 is equal to 0*s[6] + 0*s[1,5] + 1*s[2,4] + 1*s[3,3] + 1*s[1,1,4] + 2*s[1,2,3] + 1*s[2,2,2] + 1*s[1,1,1,3] + 1*s[1,1,2,2] + 0*s[1,1,1,1,2] + 0*s[1,1,1,1,1,1], therefore the 4th row is (0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0).
