%N A330231 Number of distinct set-systems that can be obtained by permuting the vertices of the set-system with BII-number n.
%C A330231 A set-system is a finite set of finite nonempty sets.
%C A330231 A binary index of n is any position of a 1 in its reversed binary expansion. The binary indices of n are row n of A048793. We define the set-system with BII-number n to be obtained by taking the binary indices of each binary index of n. Every set-system has a different BII-number. For example, 18 has reversed binary expansion (0,1,0,0,1), and since the binary indices of 2 and 5 are {2} and {1,3} respectively, the BII-number of {{2},{1,3}} is 18. Elements of a set-system are sometimes called edges.
%F A330231 a(n) is a divisor of A326702(n)!.
%e A330231 30 is the MM-number of {{2},{3},{1,2},{1,3}}, with vertex permutations
%e A330231   {{1},{2},{1,3},{2,3}}
%e A330231   {{1},{3},{1,2},{2,3}}
%e A330231   {{2},{3},{1,2},{1,3}}
%e A330231 so a(30) = 3.

%Y A330231 The version for MM-numbers is A330098.
