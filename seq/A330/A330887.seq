%N A330887 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of partitions of n into k consecutive parts that differ by 3, n >= 1, k >= 1, and the first element of column k is in the row that is the k-th pentagonal number (A000326).
%C A330887 T(n,k) is 0 or 1, so T(n,k) represents the "existence" of the mentioned partition: 1 = exists, 0 = does not exist.
%C A330887 Since the trivial partition n is counted, so T(n,1) = 1.
%C A330887 This is an irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k), n >= 1, k >= 1, in which column k lists 1's interleaved with k-1 zeros, and the first element of column k is in the row that is the k-th pentagonal number.
%C A330887 This triangle can be represented with a diagram of overlapping curves, in which every column of triangle is represented by a periodic curve.
%C A330887 For a general theorem about the triangles of this family see A303300.

%e A330887 For n = 22 there are two partitions of 22 into consecutive parts that differ by 3, including 22 as a partition. They are [22] and [10, 7, 4, 1]. There are no partitions of this kind with two parts nor with three parts, so the 22nd row of the triangle is [1, 0, 0, 1].
