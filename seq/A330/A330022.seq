%N A330022 Length of shortest binary string containing, as contiguous blocks, all palindromes of length n.
%C A330022 Greedy supersequence algorithms give the upper bounds a(7) <= 60, a(8) <= 74, a(9) <= 142, a(10) <= 180, a(11) <= 344, a(12) <= 410, a(13) <= 798. Probably some of these are tight. The value for a(6) was computed by checking all 8! arrangements of the 8 palindromes of length 3, optimizing overlaps. Probably someone with more computing power could compute a(7) (resp., a(8)) by checking all 16! = 20922789888000 arrangements of the palindromes of length 7 (resp., 8).
%e A330022 The corresponding strings for 1 <= n <= 6 are:
%e A330022 1: 01
%e A330022 2: 0011
