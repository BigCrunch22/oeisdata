%N A330807 a(1) = 2; a(n+1) = Sum_{k=1..n} {S(a(k)): S(a(k)) = S(a(n))}, where S is sopfr (A001414).
%C A330807 a(n+1) is k(n)*sopfr(a(n)), where k(n) is the number of times (up to and including a(n)) that a term having the same sopfr as a(n) has occurred in the sequence so far.
%C A330807 The smallest possible initial term is a(1)=2, since 2 is the smallest number having a prime divisor. Not every integer appears; for example, 3 cannot occur unless chosen as a(1) (in which case 2 cannot appear).
%C A330807 The primes do not appear in their natural order (e.g., 31 precedes 29). If the lesser of twin primes p is a(k) and the greater twin has not already occurred, then a(k+2) is the greater twin. Whereas if a composite number appears, it may appear more than once, a prime > 2, if it appears, can appear once only. Open question: Do all primes (except for 3) eventually appear?

%e A330807 a(2)=2 because it is the sopfr of a(1) and there are no prior terms which could contribute to the sum.
%e A330807 a(3)=2+2=4 because 2 has occurred twice already as sopf of prior terms.
%e A330807 a(7)=5 because a(6)=6 and has sopfr 5 which has not been seen before.
