%N A330919 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct squarefree numbers such that for any n > 0, either a(n)/a(n+1) or a(n+1)/a(n) is a prime number.
%C A330919 In other words, consecutive terms differ exactly by one prime factor.
%C A330919 This sequence has strong connections with A163252:
%C A330919 - here consecutive terms differ by one prime factor, there by one binary digit,
%C A330919 - for any n > 0, A163252(n-1) encodes in binary form the prime numbers appearing in a(n).
%C A330919 Odd indexed terms have an even number of prime factors and vice versa.
%C A330919 For any prime number p: as there are only finitely many squarefree numbers with greatest prime factor < p, eventually the sequence contains a multiple of p.
