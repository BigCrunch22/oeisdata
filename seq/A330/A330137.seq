%N A330137 Numbers m such that 1 < gcd(m, 30) < m and m does not divide 30^e for e >= 0.
%C A330137 Numbers m that are neither 5-smooth nor reduced residues mod 30. Such numbers m have at least 1 prime factor p <= 5 and at least 1 prime factor q > 5.
%C A330137 Complement of the union of A007775 and A051037.
%C A330137 Analogous to A105115 for A120944(2) = 10. This sequence applies to the second primorial in A120944, i.e., 30 = A002110(2).

%e A330137 14 is in the sequence since gcd(14, 30) = 2 and 14 does not divide 30^e with integer e >= 0.
%e A330137 15 is not in the sequence since 15 | 30.
%e A330137 16 is not in the sequence since 16 | 30^4.
%e A330137 17 is not in the sequence since 17 is coprime to 30.
