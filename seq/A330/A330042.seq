%e A330042 For n=3, the weak order on S_3 has the cover relations 123<132, 123<213, 132<312, 213<231, 312<321, 231<321, and there are four essential lattice congruences, namely {}, {132=312}, {213=231}, {132=312,213=231}. The cover graph of the first one is a 6-cycle, the cover graph of the middle two is a 5-cycle, and the cover graph of the last one is a 4-cycle. These are 3 non-isomorphic regular graphs, showing that a(3)=3.
