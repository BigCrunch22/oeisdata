%N A330554 Union of 2, A282178, and A330339.
%C A330554 Equivalently, primes that occur in columns 0, 1, or 2 of the triangle in A330339. [Corrected by _Walter Trump_, Dec 23 2019]
%C A330554 The asymptotic behavior of A282178 and A330339 is a mystery. It is not even known if they are infinite. They are closely related. A282178 contains primes == 3 mod 4, and A330339 primes == 1 mod 4. Perhaps by combining them in this way some properties will become more visible.
