%N A330599 If a(n) uses fewer digits than a(n+1), we compute K = |a(n) - a(n+1)|. The successive such Ks rebuild the sequence itself, with a(1) = 5.
%C A330599 The intent of the authors was not to produce the lexicographically earliest sequence S of distinct terms > 0 with this property; instead they used two rules:
%C A330599 Let x be the current last term, y the next term, z the term after that and w a previous term to be matched. The number of digits in x is denoted $x$.
%C A330599 The two rules are:
%C A330599 1) If possible, y is selected so that y - x = w and $y$ > $x$, for example x=5, y=10, w=5 in (5, 10);
%C A330599 2) Otherwise first select y with $y$ <= $x$ and then z so that z - y = w and $z$ > $y$, for example x=10, y=1, z=11, w=10 in (5, 10, 1, 11).

%e A330599 As 5 uses fewer digits than 10, we compute K1 = |5-10| = 5;
%e A330599 as 10 uses more digits than 1, we don't do anything;
%e A330599 as 1 uses fewer digits than 11, we compute K2 = |1-11| = 10;
%e A330599 as 11 and 99 use the same number of digits, we don't do anything;
%e A330599 as 99 uses fewer digits than 100, we compute K3 = |99-100| = 1;
%e A330599 as 100 uses more digits than 2, we don't do anything;
%e A330599 as 2 uses fewer digits than 13, we compute K4 = |2-13| = 11;
%e A330599 as 13 uses fewer digits than 112, we compute K5 = |13-112| = 99; etc.
%e A330599 We see that the succession of K1, K2, K3, K4, K5, ... reproduces S.
%e A330599 a(4) = 11 illustrates the Comments section, as a(4) = 2 could also extend S with no contradiction. But 11, one digit longer than 2, was chosen instead.
%e A330599 a(9) = 112 illustrates the same option, as a(9) = 4 could also extend S with no contradiction. But 112, one digit longer than 13, was preferred.
