%N A330868 Number of proper divisors d of n such that n-d is squarefree.
%F A330868 a(n) = Sum_{d|n, d<n} mu(n-d)^2, where mu is the Möbius function (A008683).
%F A330868 Let m = p^k, where p is a prime and k is a positive integer. Then a(p^k) = Sum_{i=0..k-1} mu(p^k - p^i)^2. In terms of m, a(m) = Sum_{j=0..Omega(m)-1} mu(m - rad(m)^j)^2, where mu = A008683, Omega = A001222 and rad = A001222.
%e A330868 a(11) = 1; The only proper divisor of 11 is 1 and 11-1 = 10 is squarefree.
%e A330868 a(12) = 3; There are five proper divisors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Of these, we see that 12-1 = 11, 12-2 = 10 and 12-6 = 6 are squarefree, but 12-3 = 9 and 12-4 = 8 are not.
%e A330868 a(13) = 0; The only proper divisor of 13 is 1, but 13-1 = 12 (which is not squarefree).
%e A330868 a(14) = 2; The proper divisors of 14 are 1, 2, and 7. Of these, only 14-1 = 13 and 14-7 = 7 are squarefree.
