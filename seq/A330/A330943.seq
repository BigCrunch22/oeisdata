%N A330943 Matula-Goebel numbers of singleton-reduced rooted trees.
%C A330943 These trees are counted by A330951.
%C A330943 A rooted tree is singleton-reduced if no non-leaf node has all singleton branches, where a rooted tree is a singleton if its root has degree 1.
%C A330943 The Matula-Goebel number of a rooted tree is the product of primes of the Matula-Goebel numbers of its branches. This gives a bijective correspondence between positive integers and unlabeled rooted trees.
%C A330943 A prime index of n is a number m such that prime(m) divides n. A number belongs to this sequence iff it is 1 or its prime indices all belong to this sequence but are not all prime.
%e A330943 The sequence of all singleton-reduced rooted trees together with their Matula-Goebel numbers begins:
