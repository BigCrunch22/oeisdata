%N A330705 Numbers k such that A173419(k) < A173419(k-1).
%C A330705 One can consider these numbers as "simple" as they require fewer steps to compute.
%C A330705 Conjecture: there are no primes in this sequence. This conjecture is directly related to the conjecture in A173419.
%Y A330705 Cf. A173419.
