%N A330367 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct nonprime terms that turns into a sequence of distinct prime numbers when the "slide the digits, don't touch the commas" operation is applied (see the Comments and Example sections).
%C A330367 Even digits "e" must slide "e" positions to the left; odd digits "o" must slide "o" positions to the right. Commas must stay where they are.
%C A330367 Maximum value for terms 1-500 is 8481315. Statistics of digits 0-9 for terms 1-500 is (0, 508, 147, 600, 180, 229, 207, 43, 212, 23). _Lars Blomberg_, Dec 16 2019

%e A330367 To understand the operation described in the Comments section, we superpose hereunder S and T, S being this sequence and T the result of the said operation:
%e A330367 S = 1, 12, 15, 111, 3633, 28, 9, 14, 314, 114, 611, ...
%e A330367 T = 2, 11, 61, 811, 1523, 43, 3, 41, 641, 311, 941, ...
%e A330367 The first digit "1" of S is now the first digit of 11 in T;
%e A330367 the second digit "1" of S is now the second digit of 11 in T;
%e A330367 the first digit "2" of S is now the first digit of T;
%e A330367 the first digit "1" of 15 in S is now the last digit of 61 in T;
%e A330367 the first digit "5" of S is now the second digit of 1523 in T, etc.
%e A330367 All terms of S are distinct and nonprimes, all terms of T are distinct and primes. The commas stayed where they were.
