%N A330816 Numbers that reach 1 under the iterations of the map k -> k/d(k) if d(k) | k, and k -> k otherwise, where d(k) is the number of divisors of k (A000005).
%C A330816 If k is a term then k/d(k) is a term.
%C A330816 The corresponding numbers of iterations to reach 1 are 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, ...
%C A330816 From _David A. Corneth_, Jan 16 2020: (Start)
%C A330816 Similar to the first comment: every term > 1 is a multiple of an earlier term.
%C A330816 Conjecture: the sequence is finite; all 45 terms are in Corneth's a-file. Heuristic evidence: I took the first few terms C and made the Cartesian product with C and the 101-smooth numbers <= 10^8, seeing which were terms and removing duplicates. This process was repeated a few times until no more new terms were found. The largest number of divisors of any of these terms is < 10^6. (End)

%e A330816 12 is a term since 12/d(12) = 12/6 = 2 and 2/d(2) = 2/2 = 1.
