%N A330239 Minimum circular (strong) similarity of a length-n binary word.
%C A330239 The circular (strong) similarity of a word w is the maximum, over all nontrivial cyclic shifts x of w, of the number of positions where x and w agree.
%C A330239 The plausible identification of this sequence with A285869, A162330, A183041 is just illusory because a(27) = 15.
%C A330239 Circular (strong) similarity is basically a one-sided version of autocorrelation, where we only care about agreement of terms, not the difference between agreement and disagreement.
%e A330239 For n = 7, one string achieving a(7) = 3 is 0001011.
%Y A330239 Cf. A162330, A183041, A285869.
