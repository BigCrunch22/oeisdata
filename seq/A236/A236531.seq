%C A236531 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 2.
%C A236531 (ii) If n > 3 is neither 11 nor 125, then n can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that 6*k - 1, 6*k + 1, prime(m) + 2 and 3*prime(m) - 10 are all prime.
%C A236531 (iii) Any integer n > 458 can be written as p + q  with q > 0 such that {p, p + 2} and {prime(q), prime(q) + 2} are both twin prime pairs.
%C A236531 This is much stronger than the twin prime conjecture. We have verified part (i) of the conjecture for n up to 2*10^7.
