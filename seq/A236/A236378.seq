%N A236378 Difference between n and the result obtained when n is remultiplied from N to GF(2)[X]: a(n) = n - A234741(n).
%C A236378 a(n) is the difference of n and the number obtained when the prime divisors of n are multiplied together in such a way that the carry-bits from intermediate products are discarded, as in A048720.
%C A236378 All terms are divisible by 4.
