%N A236470 a(n) = |{0 < k < n: p = prime(k) + phi(n-k), p + 2 and prime(p) + 2 are all prime}|, where phi(.) is Euler's totient function.
%C A236470 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 948.
%C A236470 We have verified this for n up to 50000.
%C A236470 The conjecture implies that there are infinitely many primes p with p + 2 and prime(p) + 2 both prime. See A236458 for such primes p.
