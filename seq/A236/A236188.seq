%N A236188 Differences between terms of compacting Eratosthenes sieve for prime(7) = 17.
%C A236188 P(x) is a function which represents a prime number at a particular ordinal x.  This pattern, dp(x), describes the difference between consecutive prime numbers as described by p(x) (see A236175) and therefore the length of dp(x) is len(p(x)) - 1 and each value in dp(x) times P(x) is the difference between values determined not primed when running one pass of a reductive sieve, starting at P(x)^2.  See A236185.
