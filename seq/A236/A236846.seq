%N A236846 Least inverse of A234742: a(n) = minimal k such that when it is remultiplied "upwards", from GF(2)[X] to N, the result is n, and 0 if no such k exists.
%C A236846 Apart from zero, each term occurs at most once. 91 is the smallest positive integer not present in this sequence.
%C A236846 Note that in contrast to the reciprocal case, where A234742(n) >= A236837(n) for all n [the former sequence gives the absolute upper bound for the latter], here it is not guaranteed that A234741(n) <= a(n) whenever a(n) > 0. For example, a(25)=25 and A234741(25)=17, and 25-17 = 8. On the other hand, a(75)=43, but A234741(75)=51, and 43-51 = -8.

%F A236846 a(n) = minimal k such that A234742(k) = n, and 0 if no such k exists.
%F A236846 For all n, a(n) <= n.
