%N A236363 Sum of digits of A114440(n).
%C A236363 Because A114440 is finite, this sequence is necessarily also finite.
%C A236363 Note that after a(23), all terms are divisible by 9 since all the terms that take three steps to arrive at 1 are multiples of 9 so the sum of digits of their predecessors must also be a multiple of 9.
