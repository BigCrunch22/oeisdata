%N A236753 Number of simple (non-intersecting) directed paths on the grid graph P_n X P_n.
%C A236753 This is the number of directed paths on P_n X P_n of any length and also includes one zero length path per vertex. - _Andrew Howroyd_, May 27 2017
%F A236753 a(n) = 2*A288032(n) + n^2. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Jun 10 2017
%e A236753 For n=2 there are 4 zero length paths (one for each vertex), 8 paths with 1 one edge, 8 paths with 2 edges and 8 paths with 3 edges, so a(2)=28. - _Andrew Howroyd_, May 27 2017
%Y A236753 Cf. A236690 (includes diagonal edges).
