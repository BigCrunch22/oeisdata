%N A236533 Number of non-congruent Heronian triangles with base length n whose apex lies on or within a space bounded by a semicircle of diameter n.
%e A236533 a(20)=3 as there are 3 non-congruent Heronian triangles with base length of 20 whose apex lies on or within the space bounded by a semicircle of diameter 20. The integer triples are (7,15,20), (11,13,20), (12,16,20).
