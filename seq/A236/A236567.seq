%N A236567 a(n) = |{0 < k < n - 2: k + phi(n-k)/2 is a square}|, where phi(.) is Euler's totient function.
%C A236567 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 5.
%C A236567 (ii) For n > 31, there is a positive integer k < n - 2 with phi(k) + phi(n-k)/2 a square. If n > 70 is not equal to 150, then phi(k) + phi(n-k) is a square for some 0 < k < n.
%C A236567 (iii) If n > 5, then phi(k) + phi(n-k)/2 is a triangular number for some 0 < k < n - 2. For each n = 20, 21, ... there is a positive integer k < n with (phi(k) + phi(n-k))/2 a triangular number.
