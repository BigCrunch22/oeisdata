%N A236192 a(n) = |{0 < k < n: p = phi(k) + phi(n-k)/4 + 1, prime(p)^2 + (2*p)^2 and p^2 + (2*prime(p))^2 are all prime}|, where phi(.) is Euler's totient function.
%C A236192 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 370.
%C A236192 (ii) For any integer n >= 700, there is a positive integer k < n such that p = phi(k) + phi(n-k)/3 - 1, prime(p)^2 + (p-1)^2 and p^2 + (prime(p)-1)^2 are all prime.
%C A236192 Clearly, part (i) of this conjecture implies that there are infinitely many primes p with prime(p)^2 + (2*p)^2 and p^2 + (2*prime(p))^2 both prime, and part (ii) implies that there are infinitely many primes p with prime(p)^2 + (p-1)^2 and p^2 + (prime(p)-1)^2 both prime.

%e A236192 a(10) = 1 since phi(2) + phi(8)/4 + 1 = 3, prime(3)^2 + (2*3)^2 = 5^2 + 6^2 = 61 and 3^2 + (2*prime(3))^2 = 3^2 + 10^2 = 109 are all prime.
%e A236192 a(1241) = 1 since phi(83) + phi(1241-83)/4 + 1 = 82 + 96 + 1 = 179, prime(179)^2 + (2*179)^2 = 1063^2 + 358^2 = 1258133 and 179^2 + (2*prime(179))^2 = 179^2 + 2126^2 = 4551917 are all prime.
