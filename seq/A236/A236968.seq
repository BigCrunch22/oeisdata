%N A236968 Number of ordered ways to write n = k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that 6*k - 1, 6*k + 1 and k + phi(m) are all prime, where phi(.) is Euler's totient function.
%C A236968 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 1. Also, any n > 12 can be written as k + m (k > 0 and m > 2) with 6*k - 1, 6*k + 1 and k + phi(m)/2 all prime.
%C A236968 (ii)  Each integer n > 34 can be written as p + q (q > 0) with p and p + phi(q) both prime. Also, any integer n > 14 can be written as p + q (q > 2) with p, p + 6 and p + phi(q)/2 all prime.
%C A236968 Clearly, part (i) of the conjecture implies that any integer n > 1 can be written as p + m - phi(m), where p is a prime and m is a positive integer.

%e A236968 a(486) = 1 since 486 = 325 + 161 with 6*325 - 1 = 1949, 6*325 + 1 = 1951 and 325 + phi(161) = 325 + 132 = 457 all prime.
