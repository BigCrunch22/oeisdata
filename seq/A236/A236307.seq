%N A236307 Discriminants d such that the ring of algebraic integers of Q(sqrt(-d)) is not a unique factorization domain.
%C A236307 Stewart & Tall (2002) show that none of the first thirteen terms listed here correspond to an imaginary quadratic ring with unique factorization by giving one example of an integer having two distinct factorizations for each ring.
%C A236307 This sequence consists of the squarefree numbers (A005117) that are not Heegner numbers (A003173).

%F A236307 a(n) = A005117(n + 9) for n > 91.
%e A236307 10 is in the sequence because 14 = 2 * 7 = (2 - sqrt(-10))(2 + sqrt(-10)), which are two distinct factorizations of 14 in Z[sqrt(-10)].
%e A236307 13 is in the sequence because 14 = 2 * 7 = (1 - sqrt(-13))(1 + sqrt(-13)), which are two distinct factorizations of 14 in Z[sqrt(-13)].
%e A236307 14 is in the sequence because 15 = 3 * 5 = (1 - sqrt(-14))(1 + sqrt(-14)), which are two distinct factorizations of 15 in Z[sqrt(-14)].
%e A236307 (Many more examples can be found for each ring; these three are from the thirteen given by Stewart & Tall (2002)).
%e A236307 And when -d = 1 mod 4 other than -3, -7, -11, -19, -43, -67 or -163, we can often use (d + 1)/4 = (1/2 - sqrt(-d)/2)(1/2 + sqrt(-d)/2) as an example, such as 4 = 2 * 2 = (1/2 - sqrt(-15)/2)(1/2 + sqrt(-15)/2) in O_(Q(sqrt(-15))).
