%N A236541 Number of ways to write 2*n = k + m with 0 < k <= m such that prime(k) + m and k + prime(m) are both prime.
%C A236541 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 31.
%C A236541 (ii) Any positive even number can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that (prime(k) - k) + m and k + (prime(m) - m) are both prime.
%C A236541 (iii) Each integer n > 24 can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that prime(k) + m*(m-1) and k*(k-1) + prime(m) are both prime.
%C A236541 (iv) Any integer n > 15 can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that prime(k) + phi(m) and phi(k) + prime(m) are both prime.
%C A236541 Part (ii) of the conjecture in A232443 implies that any integer n > 7 can be written as k + m (k > 0, m > 0) with prime(k) + m = n + prime(k) - k prime.

%e A236541 a(9) = 1 since 2*9 = 8 + 10 with prime(8) + 10 = 19 + 10 = 29 and 8 + prime(10) = 8 + 29 = 37 both prime.
%e A236541 a(92) = 1 since 2*92 = 86 + 98 with prime(86) + 98 = 443 + 98 = 541 and 86 + prime(98) = 86 + 521 = 607 both prime.
