%N A236690 Number of simple directed paths on an n X n king graph.
%C A236690 This is the number (assuming each character is unique) of strings that are possible in an n X n Boggle grid.
%C A236690 This sequence gives the number of directed paths. Paths may start and end on any vertex and may be of any length. Paths of length zero are counted here. - _Andrew Howroyd_, May 12 2017
