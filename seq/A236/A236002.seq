%N A236002 Number of overcompositions of n.
%C A236002 Analog to overpartitions, here an overcomposition is defined to be a composition in which the first occurrence of each distinct number may be overlined (see example).
%C A236002 Also 1 together with the row sums of A235999.
%C A236002 For the number of partitions of n see A000041.
%C A236002 For the number of compositions of n see A011782.
%C A236002 For the number of overpartitions of n see A015128.
%C A236002 Note that there are several orderings of overcompositions, the same as the orderings of compositions, but apparently for every ordering of overcompositions there are also several suborderings according to the arrangements of the overlined parts. The same for overpartitions. See one of them in Example section.

%e A236002 For n = 4 the 26 overcompositions of 4 are: [4], [4'], [1,3], [1',3], [1,3'], [1',3'], [2,2], [2',2], [1,1,2], [1',1,2], [1,1,2'], [1',1,2'], [3,1], [3',1], [3,1'], [3',1'], [1,2,1], [1',2,1], [1,2',1], [1',2',1], [2,1,1], [2',1,1], [2,1',1], [2',1',1], [1,1,1,1], [1',1,1,1].
