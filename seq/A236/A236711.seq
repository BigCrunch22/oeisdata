%C A236711 Are all terms multiples of 5?
%C A236711 The answer is "no"; 2789895602 = 2 * 13^6 * 17^2 is a term that is not a multiple of 5. Is it the first such term? - _Zak Seidov_, Jul 05 2015
%C A236711 a(152) = 2789895602 is the first term that is not divisible by 5. In the first 1000 terms, the only powers to which 5 appears as a factor are 0 (for 10 terms, beginning with a(152), after which the next does not occur until a(331)), 2 (for only 14 terms, the smallest of which is a(22) = 241340450 = 2 * 5^2 * 13^6), 6 (for 360 terms), and 10 (for the remaining 616 terms). - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Jul 07 2015
