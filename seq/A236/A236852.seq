%N A236852 Remultiply n first "downward", from N to GF(2)[X], and then remultiply that result back "upward", from GF(2)[X] to N: a(n) = A234742(A234741(n)).
%C A236852 This sequence appears to be completely multiplicative with a(p) = A234742(p) although neither A234741 or A234742 are even multiplicative. Terms tested up to n = 10^7. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Aug 01 2018
%C A236852 Yes, this is true. Consider for example n = p*q*r*r, where p, q, r are primes in N. Then A234741(n) = p1 x q1 x q2 x q3 x r1 x r2 x r1 x r2, where p1, q1, r1, ..., are the irreducible factors of p, q, r when factored over GF(2), and x stands for multiplication in ring GF(2)[X] (A048720). [Note that these irreducible factors are not necessarily primes in N, except p1 (= p), which must be a term of A091206. Also, A234741(p) = p for any prime p.] Next, a(n) = A234742(p1 x q1 x q2 x q3 x r1 x r2 x r1 x r2) = p1 * q1 * q2 * q3 * r1 * r2 * r1 * r2, which can be obtained also as a(p)*a(q)*a(r)*a(r), thus proving the multiplicativity. - _Antti Karttunen_, Aug 02 2018

%e A236852 From _Antti Karttunen_, Aug 02 2018: (Start)
%e A236852 For n = 3, we have A234741(3) = 3 = 11 in binary, which encodes a (0,1)-polynomial x+1, which is irreducible over GF(2) thus A234742(3) = 3 and  a(3) = 3.
%e A236852 For n = 5, we have A234741(5) = 5 = 101 in binary, which encodes a (0,1)-polynomial x^2 + 1, which factorizes as (x+1)(x+1) when factored over GF(2), that is 5 = A048720(3,3), thus it follows that A234742(5) = 3*3 = 9, and a(5) = 9.
%e A236852 For n = 9 = 3*3, we have A234741(9) = A048720(3,3) = 5, and A234742(5) = 9 as shown above. Also by multiplicativity, we have a(3*3) = a(3)*a(3) = 3*3 = 9.
