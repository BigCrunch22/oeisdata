%N A372043 a(1) = 1. For n > 1 a(n) is the smallest unused k such that A007947(k*a(n-1)) is novel.
%C A372043 In other words least novel k such that the radical of (k*a(n-1)) has not been seen earlier as the radical of the product of any pair of consecutive terms (radical means A007947, often abbreviated as "rad" in formulae, see Example).
%C A372043 This sequence is a permutation of the positive integers (A000027), with primes in order.
%C A372043 Initially powers of 2 (>= 4) are flanked by primes: (5,4,7); (11,8,13); (23,16,29), but this pattern does not continue past 16.
%C A372043 From _Michael De Vlieger_, Apr 21 2024: (Start)
%C A372043 a(n) = k = p^m implies a(n-1) is indivisible by p prime.
%C A372043 a(n) = k = 2^m implies a(n-1) is odd.
%C A372043 a(n) = k = p implies a(n-1) is not a power of p, hence, there exist no adjacent powers of the same prime in the sequence.

%e A372043 a(1) = 1, rad(1) = 1 so a(2) = 2, the least unused number such that rad(2*a(1)) = 2 and no product of two consecutive prior terms has rad = 2.
%e A372043 Likewise a(3) = 3 since rad(2*3) = 6 is novel.
%e A372043 a(4) cannot be 4 because then we would have rad(3*4) = 6 and this is not novel (see a(3)). However 5 works since rad(3*5) = 15, and this is novel.
