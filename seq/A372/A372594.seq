%N A372594 Irregular triangle read by rows, where the n-th row gives the number of steps in the hydra game (the version described in A180368) when the initial hydra is each of the A000108(n) ordered trees with n edges (ordered by lexicographic order of their corresponding Dyck words as in A063171).
%C A372594 Here, in contrast to A180368, the rightmost head is always chopped off. Equivalently, chop off the leftmost head but interpret the Dyck words as describing the trees from the right to the left (or sort the Dyck words colexicographically).
%F A372594 T(n,k) = T(n-1,k)+1 if 1 <= k <= A000108(n-1).

%e A372594 In the examples below, the hydra games for some initial trees are shown. The root is denoted by "R", internal nodes by "o", the head to be chopped off by "X", other heads by "H". Numbers below the arrows show how many steps that are required to go from the tree on the left to the tree on the right.
