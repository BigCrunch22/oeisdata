%N A372733 Number of curved edges among all distinct circles that can be constructed from the 3 vertices and the equally spaced 3*n points placed on the sides of an equilateral triangle when every pair of the 3 + 3*n points are connected by a circle and where the points lie at the ends of the circle's diameter.
%C A372733 A circle is constructed for every pair of the 3 + 3*n points, the two points lying at the ends of a diameter of the circle.
%C A372733 See A372731 and A372732 for images of the circles.
%F A372733 a(n) = A372731(n) + A372732(n) - 1 by Euler's formula.
