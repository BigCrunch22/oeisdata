%N A372141 Primes p that are palindromic in some prime base q, where q < p.
%C A372141 If we remove either constraint of q < p or q being prime, then the sequence would be all prime numbers (A000040).
%C A372141 By definition it is a superset of A016041, and is a proper superset by construction (e.g., 13 is in the sequence).
%C A372141 Some terms have multiple bases that yield palindromic representations, the first being 31 (which is palindromic in both base 2 and base 5). The smallest prime p such that there exist n distinct primes less than p that give palindromic representations of p is A372142(n).

%e A372141 11 is not in this sequence as its representation in base 2 is 1011, in base 3 is 102, in base 5 is 21, in base 7 is 14, none of which are palindromic.
%e A372141 1483 is in this sequence as its representation in base 37 is 131, which is palindromic.
