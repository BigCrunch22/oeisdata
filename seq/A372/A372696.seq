%N A372696 For n>1, if n mod a(n-1) = 0 or a(n-1) mod n = 0, set a(n) = n + a(n-1); otherwise a(n) = abs(n - a(n-1)). Start with a(1)=1.
%C A372696 Starting at n=5, the sequence follows a set pattern every 12 terms: a(n) = n-2, 3, n-3, 4, n+4, 3, n+3, 2, n+2, 1, n+1, 2n according as n == 0 to 11 (mod 12), respectively.
%C A372696 This means a new peak is reached every 12th term, starting from n = 11.
