%N A372191 Number of unlabeled simple graphs covering n vertices with a unique undirected cycle of length > 2.
%C A372191 An undirected cycle in a graph is a sequence of distinct vertices, up to rotation and reversal, such that there are edges between all consecutive elements, including the last and the first.
%H A372191 Gus Wiseman, <a href="/A372191/a372191.png">The a(3) = 1 through a(6) = 16 covering graphs with a unique cycle</a>.
%F A372191 First differences of A372192.
%Y A372191 For no cycles we have A144958 (non-covering A005195), labeled A105784 (non-covering A001858).
%Y A372191 Counting triangles instead of cycles gives A372174 (non-covering A372194), labeled A372171 (non-covering A372172).
%Y A372191 The non-covering version is A372192, labeled A372193.
%Y A372191 The labeled version is A372195, column k = 1 of A372175.
%Y A372191 A002807 counts cycles in a complete graph.
%Y A372191 A006125 counts graphs, unlabeled A000088.
%Y A372191 A006129 counts covering graphs, unlabeled A002494.
%Y A372191 A372167 counts graphs by triangles, non-covering A372170.
%Y A372191 A372173 counts unlabeled graphs by triangles (non-covering A263340).
%Y A372191 A372176 counts labeled graphs by directed cycles.
