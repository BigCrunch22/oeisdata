%N A372049 a(n) is the index of the Lucas number that is the ratio of the sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers divided by the largest possible Fibonacci number.
%C A372049 The sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers is sequence A000071.
%C A372049 When we divide the sum by the largest Fibonacci number that divides the sum, we always get a Lucas number.
%C A372049 For n > 3, a(n+4) = a(n)+2.
%e A372049 The sum of the first ten Fibonacci numbers is 143. The largest Fibonacci that divides this sum is 13, the seventh Fibonacci number. After the division we get 143/13 = 11, the fifth Lucas number. Thus, a(10) = 5.
