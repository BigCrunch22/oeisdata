%N A372842 a(n) is the number of parking functions of order n for which the second spot is lucky.
%C A372842 This sequence enumerates parking functions with lucky second spot (where a lucky spot is one which is parked in by a car which prefers that spot).

%F A372842 a(n) = (3/4)*(n+1)^(n-1) - (1/4)*(n-1)^(n-1).
%e A372842 For clarity, we write parentheses around parking functions. For n = 2, the a(2) = 2 solutions are the parking functions of length 2 with a lucky second spot are (1,2) and (2,1). The parking function (1,1) is not one of the solutions because the car which parks in the second spot did not prefer the second spot; this parking function does not contribute to our count.
