%N A372839 Number of extreme submodular functions on n items, up to equivalence.
%C A372839 Number of extreme rays of the cone of (equivalence classes of) sub- or supermodular functions on an n-dimensional ground set. Two submodular functions are equivalent if their difference is a modular function. A submodular function f is extreme if any representation of f as a sum of submodular functions implies that the summands are equivalent to f.
%C A372839 Equivalently, number of extreme rays of the type cone of the (n-1)-dimensional permutahedron in R^n. That is, number of irreducible Minkowski summands (modulo translation and dilation) of the permutahedron. Here, a polytope P is irreducible if in any decomposition of P as a Minkowski sum, the summands must be (potentially translated and dilated) copies of P.
%C A372839 The sequence is known to be doubly-exponential. To the best of my knowledge, only the four given terms are known.
