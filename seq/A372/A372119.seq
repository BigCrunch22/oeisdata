%N A372119 Numbers k such that the k-th composition in standard order is not biquanimous.
%C A372119 The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%C A372119 A finite multiset of numbers is defined to be biquanimous iff it can be partitioned into two multisets with equal sums. Biquanimous partitions are counted by A002219 and ranked by A357976.
