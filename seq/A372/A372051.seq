%N A372051 a(n) is the index of the Lucas number that is a ratio of the sum of the first A000217(n) Fibonacci numbers divided by the largest possible Fibonacci number.
%C A372051 The sum of the first n Fibonacci numbers is sequence A000071.
%C A372051 When we divide the sum by the largest possible Fibonacci number, we always get a Lucas number.
%C A372051 A000217() are the triangular numbers.
%e A372051 The sum of the first ten Fibonacci numbers is 143. The largest Fibonacci that divides this sum is 13, the seventh Fibonacci number. After the division we get 143/13 = 11, the fifth Lucas number. Thus, as 10 is the fourth triangular number, a(4) = 5.
