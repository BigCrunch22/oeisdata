%N A372249 The smallest number k which, when written in base n, has a factorization k = f1*f2*...*fr where the digits of {k, f1, f2, ..., fr} together contain the digits 0,1,...,(n-1) exactly once. Set a(n) = -1 if no such k exists.
%C A372249 The offset begins at 7 as in bases 2..6 no term exists.
%C A372249 Assumes all factors f_i > 1. If f_i = 1 is allowed, then a(7) = 104 = 1*4*26, a(10) = 4830 = 1*2*5*7*69, a(12) = 72240 = 1*4*6*7*430, a(15) = 4244940 = 1*2*3*7*9*10*1123, ... - _Chai Wah Wu_, Apr 24 2024
