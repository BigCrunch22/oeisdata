%N A372755 Terms of A319928 that are congruent to 4 modulo 8: Numbers k == 4 (mod 8) such that there is no other m such that (Z/mZ)* is isomorphic to (Z/kZ)*, where (Z/kZ)* is the multiplicative group of integers modulo k.
%C A372755 This is a subsequence of A296233. As a result, all members in this sequence should not satisfy any congruence mentioned there, so terms of A319928 that are congruent to 4 modulo 8 are rare. In particular, all terms are divisible by 252 = 4 * 3^2 * 7, 324 = 4 * 3^4 or 2052 = 4 * 3^3 * 19.

%e A372755 252 is a term because there is no other k such that (Z/kZ)* = (Z/252Z)* = C_2 X C_6 X C_6.
%e A372755 324 is a term because there is no other k such that (Z/kZ)* = (Z/324Z)* = C_2 X C_54.
%e A372755 2052 is a term because there is no other k such that (Z/kZ)* = (Z/2052Z)* = C_2 X C_18 X C_18.
