%C A372255 The maximum deck size to perform the n-card trick, when the audience gives the assistant n cards and points the card to hide. The assistant arranges the leftover n-1 cards in a circle, for the magician to guess the hidden card.

%e A372255 Consider a four-card trick, where the assistant gets four cards from a deck and is told which card to hide. Then, the assistant arranges the remaining three cards in a circle, and the magician needs to guess the hidden card. Up to rotations, there are two ways to arrange three cards in a circle. Thus, the assistant can only signal one of two numbers. That means the maximum deck size is 5, implying that a(4) = 5.
