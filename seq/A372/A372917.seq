%N A372917 a(n) is the number of distinct rectangles with area n whose vertices lie on points of a unit square grid.
%C A372917 A rectangle in the square unit grid has the sides W = w*sqrt(r) and H = h*sqrt(r). The area is therefore n = w*h*r. Let r be a squarefree divisor of n that can be written as the sum of two squares x^2 + y^2. The number of distinct rectangles is then the sum of the number of ways for each value of r to decompose n/r into two factors w and h (with w >= h).

%F A372917 a(n) = ceiling(Product_{i=1..omega(n)}(k[i]*e[i] + 1)/2), with k[i] = 2 if p[i] mod 4 = 3 and k[i] = 1 else, where p[i]^e[i] is the prime factorization of n.
%e A372917 See also the linked illustrations of the terms a(4) = 3, a(8) = 4, a(15) = 3.
%e A372917 n = 4 has the three divisors 1, 2, 4. Since 4 is not squarefree, r can have the values 1 or 2. For r = 1 = 1^2 + 0^2 there are two rectangles (2,2), (4,1). For r = 2 = 1^2 + 1^2 and n/r = 4/2 = 2 = w*h there is the rectangle (2*sqrt(2), 1*sqrt(2)). That's a total of a(4) = 3 distinct rectangles.
%e A372917 n = 8 has the four divisors 1, 2, 4, 8. Since 4 and 8 are not squarefree, r can have the values 1 or 2. For r = 1 = 1^2 + 0^2 there are two rectangles (4,2), (8,1). For r = 2 = 1^2 + 1^2 and n/r = 8/2 = 4 = w*h there are the rectangles (4*sqrt(2), 1*sqrt(2)) and (2*sqrt(2), 2*sqrt(2)). That's a total of a(8) = 4 distinct rectangles.
%e A372917 n = 15 has the four divisors 1, 3, 5, 15. They are all squarefree, but 3 and 15 cannot be written as a sum of two squares, r can only have the values 1 or 5. For r = 1 = 1^2 + 0^2 there are two rectangles (5,3), (15,1). For r = 5 = 2^2 + 1^2 and n/r = 15/5 = 3 = w*h there is the rectangles (3*sqrt(5), 1*sqrt(5)). That's a total of a(15) = 3 distinct rectangles.
