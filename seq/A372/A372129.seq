%N A372129 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct nonnegative integers such that for any n >= 0, the binary expansions of a(n), a(2*n+1) and a(2*n+2) have distinct 1's.
%C A372129 This sequence is a permutation of the nonnegative integers with inverse A372131:
%C A372129 - for any k >= 0, the first term >= 2^k is precisely 2^k,
%C A372129 - all powers of 2 appear in the sequence, in increasing order,
%C A372129 - for any v >= 0, every power of 2 that doesn't appear in the binary expansion of v provides an opportunity to select v later, and eventually v will appear in the sequence.
