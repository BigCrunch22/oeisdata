%N A372557 Numbers k such that the least number of Jacobsthal numbers that add up to k, A372555(k), is less than the number needed with the greedy algorithm, A265745(k).

%e A372557 63 = 21+21+21 has A372555(63)=3 for its optimal, non-greedy solution, and A265745(63) = 5 for its greedy solution 63 = 43+11+5+3+1, therefore 63 is included in this sequence. (From _Yuriko Suwa_'s Jul 11 2021 comment in A265745.)
%e A372557 84 = 21+21+21+21 has A372555(84)=4 for its optimal, non-greedy solution, and A265745(84) = 6 for its greedy solution 84 = 43+21+11+5+3+1, therefore 84 is included in this sequence.
%e A372557 169 = 85+21+21+21+21 has A372555(169)=5 for its optimal, non-greedy solution, and A265745(169) = 7 for its greedy solution 169 = 85+43+21+11+5+3+1, therefore 169 is included in this sequence.
