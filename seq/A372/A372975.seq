%N A372975 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number such that a(n) shares a factor with a(n-1) while omega(a(n)) does not equals omega(a(n-1)).
%C A372975 The sequence shows similar behavior to the EKG sequence A064413; for the terms studied the primes appear in the natural order, and when a prime p is a term, the proceeding and following terms are 2p and 3p respectively.
%C A372975 For larger n a graph of the sequence also displays very similar behavior to A064413, although for the first ~2500 terms the main concentration of terms are along two lines which eventually join - see the attached image of the first 5000 terms.
%C A372975 The fixed points begin 1, 2, 22, 26, 36, 38, 1991, 2023, 2159, 2189, 2627; it is likely no more exist. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A372975 a(3) = 6 as a(2) = 2 and omega(2) = A001221(2) = 1, and 6 shares a factor with 2 while omega(6) = A001221(6) = 2 which does not equal 1.
