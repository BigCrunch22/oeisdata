%N A372975 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest unused positive number such that a(n) shares a factor with a(n-1) while omega(a(n)) does not equal omega(a(n-1)).
%C A372975 The sequence shows similar behavior to the EKG sequence A064413; for the terms studied the primes appear in the natural order, and when a prime p is a term, the proceeding and following terms are 2p and 3p respectively.
%C A372975 For larger n a graph of the sequence also displays very similar behavior to A064413, although for the first ~2500 terms the main concentration of terms are along two lines which eventually join - see the attached image of the first 5000 terms.
%C A372975 The fixed points begin 1, 2, 22, 26, 36, 38, 1991, 2023, 2159, 2189, 2627; it is likely no more exist. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A372975 From _Michael De Vlieger_, May 28 2024: (Start)
%C A372975 Four general trajectories become apparent in log log scatterplot:
%C A372975 1. Beta, the trajectory of primes a(j) = p.
%C A372975 2. Alpha, the trajectory of numbers a(j+1) = 3*p.
%C A372975 3. Delta, the trajectory of perfect prime powers and numbers k with omega(k) = 3.
%C A372975 4. Gamma, the trajectory of all other (composite) numbers.
%C A372975 Delta begins with a(21) = 30 and merges with gamma around n = 2958. The merger alters the "slope" of all trajectories as a result. Thereafter, a number k with omega(k) = 2 is comparable in size with one that has omega(k) = 3. This does not seem to happen for omega(k) = 4, etc. (See a(2102) = 2310).
%C A372975 Perfect prime powers may technically constitute a separate, more scattered trajectory superposed upon delta. Still, the merger with gamma seems to occur around the same point as with delta.
%C A372975 Exception to first comment: 12 follows 3, since omega(9) = omega(3). The number 12 lies outside trajectory alpha, since 12 = 4*3. (End)
