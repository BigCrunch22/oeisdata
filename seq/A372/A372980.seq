%N A372980 Irregular table read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of k-gons, k>=3, among all distinct circles that can be constructed from the 4 vertices and the equally spaced 4*n points placed on the sides of a square, using only a compass.
%C A372980 A circle is constructed for every pair of the 4 + 4*n points, the first point defines the circle's center while the second the radius distance.
%C A372980 Unlike A372617, a similar sequence but with vertices on an equilateral triangle, for the terms studied no graph has 2-edged regions.
%C A372980 See A372977 and A372978 for images of the circles.
%F A372980 Sum of row n = A372978(n).
