%N A372152 Number of k in the range 2^n <= k < 2^(n+1) whose shortest addition chain does not have length n, n+1 or n+2.
%C A372152 The length of the shortest addition chain for k is A003313(k).
%C A372152 Dividing natural numbers into sections 2^n <= k < 2^(n+1), more than half of the 2^n numbers available in a section have the shortest addition chains given by
%C A372152  n (for k=2^n),
%C A372152  n+1 (for k=2^n+2^m, m in [0..n-1], A048645), or
%C A372152  n+2 (for some k in A072823).
%C A372152 The sequence gives the numbers of k within each section (N_oth) that have the shortest addition chains other than n, n+1, and n+2.
%C A372152 In particular for 4 <= n <= 6, N_oth = 2^n - n^2 + 2 and for n >= 7, N_oth = 2^n - n^2 + 1.
%Y A372152 Cf. A003313, A048645, A072823, A014701, A024012.
