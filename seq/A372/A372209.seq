%e A372209 3 is in the sequence since m = 3*5*7 = 105 is such that 3 is less than the cube root of 105, but both 5 and 7 exceed it.
%e A372209 5 is not in the sequence because m = 5*7*11 = 385 is such that both 5 and 7 are less than the cube root.
%e A372209 7 is in the sequence since m = 7*11*13 = 1001 is such that 7 < 1001^(1/3), but both 11 and 13 are larger than 1001^(1/3), etc.
