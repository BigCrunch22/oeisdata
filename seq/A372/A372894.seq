%N A372894 A positive integer 2^k*m, where m is odd and k >= 0, belongs to this sequence iff the Jacobi symbol (F_n/m) = -1 for only a finite number of Fermat numbers F_n = A000215(n).
%C A372894 Can be seen as the opposite of A129802.
%C A372894 Let m be an odd number and ord(2,m) = 2^r*d be the multiplicative order of 2 modulo m, where d is odd, then 2^2^n + 1 is congruent to one of 2^2^r + 1, 2^2^(r+1) + 1, ..., 2^2^(r+ord(2,d)-1) + 1 modulo m, so it suffices to check these ord(2,d) numbers.
%C A372894 Note that if m > 1, then m does not divide 2^2^n + 1 for n >= r, otherwise we would have 2^(2^n*d) = (2^ord(2,m))^2^(n-r) == 1 (mod m) and 2^(2^n*d) = (2^2^n)^d == (-1)^d == -1 (mod m). As a result, m is a term if and only if the Jacobi symbol ((2^2^n + 1)/m) is equal to 1 for m = r, r+1, ..., r+ord(2,d)-1.
%C A372894 By definition, a squarefree number that is a product of elite primes (A102742) or anti-elite primes (A128852) is a term if and only if its number of elite factors is even. But a squarefree term can have factors that are neither elite nor anti-elite, the smallest being 341 = 11*31.
%C A372894 Contains divisors of Fermat numbers >= 17 (A307843 \ {3,5}) since they are products of elite primes.

%e A372894 For n >= 1, we have 2^2^n + 1 == 65, 5, 17, 257 (mod 341) respectively for n == 0, 1, 2, 3 (mod 4). As we have (65/341) = (5/341) = (17/341) = (257/341) = 1, 341 is a term.
