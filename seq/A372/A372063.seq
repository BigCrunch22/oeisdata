%N A372063 a(n) = A280864(n) - A280866(n).
%C A372063 A280864 and A280866 are closely related. There is a proof that A280866 is a permutation of the positive integers, but for A280864 this is only a conjecture. The present sequence compares them term-by-term; A372064 compares their inverses; and A372065 compares where the primes appear.
