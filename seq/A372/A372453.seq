%N A372453 a(n) = A372443(n) - A086893(1+A372447(n)).
%C A372453 These are the differences obtained when the term of A086893 that has the same binary length as A372443(n) is subtracted from the latter. Here A372443(n) gives the n-th iterate of 27 with Reduced Collatz-function R, where R(n) = A000265(3*n+1).
%C A372453 Note that for all n >= 1, R(A086893(2n-1)) = 1, and R(A086893(2n)) = 5 (with R(5) = 1), so the first zero here, a(39) = 0 indicates that the iteration will soon have reached the terminal 1, and indeed, A372443(41) = 1.

%e A372453 The term of A086893 that has same binary length as A372443(0) = 27 is 21 [as 21 = 10101_2 in binary, and 27 = 11011_2 in binary], therefore a(0) = 27-21 = 6.
%e A372453 The term of A086893 that has same binary length as A372443(1) = 41 is 53, therefore a(1) = 41-53 = -12.
