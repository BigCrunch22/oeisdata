%N A372196 a(1) = 1. For n > 1, let m be the number of times that the value a(n-1) has appeared (including its appearance at a(n-1)); if m > 1 then a(n) = m, otherwise a(n) = a(a(n-1)).
%C A372196 The sequence refers to itself. If k = a(n-1) is a novel term, then a(n) equals the term whose index is k; otherwise a(n) is the number of times k has appeared in a(1)..a(n-1).
%C A372196 All positive integers appear in the sequence.
%C A372196 For any n, there exist numbers m > n such that a(m) = a(n), and there exist numbers m > n such that a(m) > a(n).
%C A372196 The graph of the largest number a(n) in the interval n = 1..j grows approximately as j^0.66.
%H A372196 Thomas Scheuerle, <a href="/A372196/a372196.png">Scatter plot of a(1 to 2000)</a>. Yellow: a(n) = a(a(n-1)), blue: a(n) indicates how often the value of a(n-1) appeared previously.
%e A372196 a(1) = 1 by definition.
%e A372196 For n = 2, a(1) = 1 has appeared only 1 time, so a(2) = a(a(1)) = a(1) = 1.
%e A372196 For n = 3, a(2) = 1 has appeared 2 times, so a(3) = 2.
%e A372196 For n = 4, a(3) = 2 has appeared only 1 time, so a(4) = a(a(3)) = a(2) = 1.
%e A372196 For n = 5, a(4) = 1 has appeared 3 times, so a(5) = 3.
%e A372196 For n = 6, a(5) = 3 has appeared only 1 time, so a(6) = a(a(5)) = a(3) = 2.
%e A372196 In the table below, m is the number of times that the value a(n-1) has appeared among the terms a(1)..a(n-1).
