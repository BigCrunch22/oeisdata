%N A372041 Least prime p such that the sum of squares of the 2n + 1 consecutive primes starting with p is prime, or -1 if no such p exists.
%C A372041 a(n) = 2 never occurs, since the sum starting at 2 is always even and >= 4, so not prime.
%C A372041 a(n) = 3 iff n is in A370633 (and equivalently iff 2*n+1 is in A071149).
%C A372041 For n == 1 (mod 3), so 2*n+1 is a multiple of 3, a(n) = 3 or -1, since all primes >= 5 are congruent to 1 (mod 6) so the sum starting at 5 or more is a multiple of 3 and so not prime.
%e A372041 a(6) = 5 because 5 is the smallest of 2*6+1 = 13 consecutive primes whose sum of squares = 5^2 + 7^2 + 11^2 + 13^2 + 17^2 + 19^2 + 23^2 + 29^2 + 31^2 + 37^2 + 41^2 + 43^2 + 47^2 = 10453 is prime.
%e A372041 a(7) = -1 because 7 == 1 (mod 3) so its only possibility is that the sum starts at 3, but 3^2 + ... + 53^2 = 13271 is not prime.
