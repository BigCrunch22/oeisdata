%N A372798 Smallest prime p such that the multiplicative order of 8 modulo p is n, or 0 if no such prime exists.
%C A372798 First prime p such that the expansion of 1/p has period (p-1)/n in base 8. Also the first prime p such that {k/p : 1 <= k <= p-1} has n different cycles when written out in base 8.

%e A372798 In the following examples let () denote the reptend. The prime numbers themselves and the fractions are written out in decimal.
%e A372798 The base-8 expansion of 1/3 is 0.(25), so the reptend has length 2 = (3-1)/1. Also, the base-8 expansions of 1/3 = 0.(25) and 2/3 = 0.(52) have only one cycle 25. 3 is the smallest such prime, so a(1) = 3.
%e A372798 The base-8 expansion of 1/17 is 0.(03607417), so the reptend has length 8 = (17-1)/2. Also, the base-8 expansions of 1/17, 2/17, ..., 16/17 have two cycles 03607417 and 13226455. 17 is the smallest such prime, so a(2) = 17.
%e A372798 The base-8 expansion of 1/13 is 0.(0473), so the reptend has length 4 = (13-1)/3. Also, the base-8 expansions of 1/13, 2/13, ..., 12/13 have three cycles 0473, 1166 and 2354. 13 is the smallest such prime, so a(3) = 13.
