%N A372547 Palindromic Zumkeller numbers in base 10.
%C A372547 Intersection of A002113 and A083207.
%C A372547 1x1, where x stands for zero or more zeros, is never divisible by 2 and 3. Since 2*3*1x1 is always a Zumkeller number, it follows that there are infinitely many terms.
%C A372547 Based on the conjecture that there are infinitely many repunit primes, one may conjecture there are infinitely many repdigit terms, since 2*3*y (where y is a repunit prime) is a repdigit palindromic Zumkeller number.
%C A372547 Note that A098775 is not a subsequence: not every abundant number is a Zumkeller number. E.g., 22122 is in A098775 but is not here. - _Amiram Eldar_, May 05 2024
