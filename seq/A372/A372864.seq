%N A372864 Numbers k such that A372720(k) = 0.
%C A372864 Let tau = A000005, let omega = A001221, let f = A008479, and let g = A372720.
%C A372864 For squarefree k, A372720(k) >= 0, since f(k) = 1 while tau(k) = 2^omega(k).
%C A372864 For prime power p^m, A372720(p^m) = 1, since f(p^m) = m while tau(k) = m+1.
%C A372864 Therefore, apart from a(1) = 1, this sequence is a proper subset of A126706.
%C A372864 In the sequence R = {k = m*s : rad(m) | s, s > 1 in A120944}, there is a smallest term k such that g(k) <= 0 and a largest term k such that g(k) is positive. For instance, in A033845 where s = 6, only {6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 54, 72, 96, 108, 144, 192, 216, 288, 432, 576, 864} are such that g(k) > 0.
%C A372864 Apart from terms in this sequence, all the rest of the terms k in R are such that g(k) is negative.
%C A372864 There are no 3-smooth numbers k > 1 in this sequence, however there are 3 terms {500, 6400, 8000} in A033846 (with s = rad(k) = 10). For s = 2*3*23, there are 6 terms {19044, 25392, 38088, 70656, 536544, 953856}.
%C A372864 Conjecture: proper subset of A361098, hence of A360765 and A360768. This is to say that k = a(n) is such that A003557(k) >= A119288(k), i.e., k/rad(k) >= second smallest prime factor of k, and A003557(k) > A053669(k), where A053669(k) is the smallest prime q that does not divide k.
