%N A372083 Largest prime that occurs as an order of a rational point of an elliptic curve over a number field of degree n.
%C A372083 Rational point is understood as F-rational point for F the number field of degree n over which some relevant elliptic curve E is defined.
%C A372083 By a result of Pierre Parent building on work of Merel Loïc, Barry Mazur, Andrew Ogg and others the n-th term is effectively bounded by 65*(3^n-1)*(2n)^6. Derickx et al. (p. 21ff) make the slightly better bound (3^(n/2)+1)^2 from Oesterlé (1994) publicly available.
%C A372083 Denoting the set of all primes at most m by Primes(m) it holds that the set of all primes realized as order of a rational point of an elliptic curve for a degree n number field is Primes(a(n)) for 1<=n<=5 and n=7 and Primes(19) union {37} for n=6.
%C A372083 Derickx et al. (p. 8) comment on the difficulties of finding the next numbers in that sequence.

%e A372083 Points of finite order are collected in the torsion subgroup T=E(F)_{tors} of the F-rational points of an elliptic curve E. For n<=4 the prime a(n) is realized by a cyclic group C_{a(n)} of order a(n) according to the survey article of Sutherland, explicitly a(1)=7 by T=C_7, a(2)=13 by T=C_13, a(3)=13 by T=C_13, a(4)=17 by T=C_17.
%Y A372083 Cf. A372206 for the analog sequence of maximal primes that occur infinitely often. Note that this sequence is a natural upper bound for A372206.
