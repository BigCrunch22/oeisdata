%F A372718 a(n) = A000217(A047457(n))/2 = A372070(n)/2.
%e A372718 10 is a triangular number that has a remainder of 2 when divided by 4. Therefore, its half, 5, is in this sequence. Moreover, the sum of the first 5*2 Fibonacci numbers is 143 (not counting zero). This sum is a product of 13, which is the (5+2 = 7)-th term of the Fibonacci sequence times 11, which is the fifth Lucas number.
