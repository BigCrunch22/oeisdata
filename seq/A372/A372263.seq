%N A372263 Least odd prime factor of the n-th sum of two consecutive primes, A001043(n) = prime(n) + prime(n+1), or 2 if there is no odd prime factor.
%C A372263 Since the sum of any two primes > 2 is even, we rather consider odd prime factors.
%C A372263 Can it be proved or disproved that there are primes that occur only finitely many times (or never) in this sequence? If so, which is the smallest such prime?
%F A372263 a(n) = max(A078701(A001043(n)), 2) = A020639(max(A000265(A001043(n)), 2)), where A000265(m) > 2 unless m is in A000079.
%e A372263 Sums of two consecutive primes are given as s(n) = A001043(n). The least odd prime factor (or 2 if there's no odd prime factor) of these terms is a(n):
