%N A372263 Least odd prime factor of the n-th sum of two consecutive primes, A001043(n) = prime(n) + prime(n+1), or 2 if there is no odd prime factor.
%C A372263 Since the sum of any two primes > 2 is even, we rather consider odd prime factors.
%C A372263 Can it be proved or disproved that there are primes that occur only finitely many times (or never) in this sequence? If so, which is the smallest such prime?
%C A372263 From _Robert Israel_, Dec 29 2024: (Start)
%C A372263 Dickson's conjecture implies that every odd prime occurs infinitely many times in the sequence.
%C A372263 a(n) = 2 if and only if n = A000720(2^k) where k is in A226178. (End)
