%N A328792 Numbers that are not the difference between any triangular number and the largest square that does not exceed it.
%e A328792 For any triangular number t, let f(t) = t - floor(sqrt(t))^2.
%e A328792 0 is not a term: for each term t in A001110, f(t) = 0.
%e A328792 1 is not a term: for each term t > 1 in A164055, f(t) = 1.
%e A328792 2 is not a term: for each term t in A214838, f(t) = 2.
%e A328792 3 is not a term: for each term t > 3 in A328791, f(t) = 3.
%e A328792 4 is a term, however: there exists no triangular number t such that f(t) = 4.
%Y A328792 The complement of A230044.
