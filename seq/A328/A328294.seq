%N A328294 Set a(1)=1 and a(2)=2. For n > 2, if a(n) had already appeared in the sequence, then a(n+1) = number of steps since its most recent appearance, as in Van Eck's sequence A181391. If a(n) had not appeared before, search instead for a(n)-1, then a(n)-2, etc., until you find a number that has appeared before.
%C A328294 In other words, let a(1)=1, a(2)=2, and for any n >= 2, let v be the greatest value <= a(n) among the first n-1 terms; a(n+1) is the least d > 0 such that a(n-d) = v.

%e A328294 We start with a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 2. 2 has not appeared before, so we search for the greatest valid integer less than 2, which in this case is 1. 1 last occurred at a(1), which is 1 term before, so a(3) = 1.
%e A328294 1 occurred 2 terms before, so a(4) = 2.
%e A328294 2 appeared at term a(2), which is 2 terms before, so a(5) = 2.
%e A328294 2 appeared most recently at term a(5), which is 1 term earlier, so a(6) = 1.
%e A328294 And so on.
