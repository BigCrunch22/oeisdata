%N A328328 Unitary admirable numbers: numbers k such that there is a proper unitary divisor d of k such that usigma(k) - 2d = 2k, where usigma is the sum of unitary divisors function (A034448).
%C A328328 Differs from A302574(n) at n >= 30.
%C A328328 Equivalently, numbers that equal to the sum of their proper unitary divisors, with one of them taken with a minus sign.
%C A328328 The unitary version of A111592.
%C A328328 The squarefree terms are also admirable numbers (A111592). The nonsquarefree terms are 150, 294, 420, 630, 660, 726, 750, 780, 840, 990, ...
%C A328328 The unitary abundant numbers (A034683) that are not unitary admirable numbers are: 210, 330, 390, 462, 510, 546, 570, 690, 714, 770, 798, 858, 870, 910, 924, 930, 966, ...
