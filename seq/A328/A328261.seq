%N A328261 Number of labeled prime graphs on n nodes, i.e., graphs with no nontrivial modules when calculating the modular decomposition.
%C A328261 A module in a (simple, undirected) graph is a subset S of vertices that are "externally indistinguishable" in the following sense: for all v_1, v_2 in S and v outside of S, v either has an edge to both v1 or v2, or it has an edge to neither of them. a(n) is the number of graphs where the only such modules S are the empty set, the singleton vertices, and the entire set of vertices.
%C A328261 The proportion of all graphs which are prime (a(n) / 2^(n choose 2)) appears to tend to 1 as n approaches infinity.

%e A328261 a(3) = 0 because there are no prime graphs on 3 vertices. a(4) = 12 because the only prime graph on 4 vertices is a line (path graph P_4), and there are 12 possible labelings of the path graph.
