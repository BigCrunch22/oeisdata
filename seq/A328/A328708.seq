%N A328708 Number of non-primitive Pythagorean triples with leg n.
%C A328708 Pythagorean triple including primitive ones and non-primitive ones. For a certain n, it may be a leg in either primitive Pythagorean triple, or non-primitive Pythagorean triple, or both.
%C A328708 This sequence is the count of n as leg in non-primitive Pythagorean triple.

%e A328708 n=3 as leg in only one primitive Pythagorean triple, (3,4,5); so a(3)=0.
%e A328708 n=6 as leg in only one non-primitive Pythagorean triple, (6,8,10); so a(6)=1.
%e A328708 n=8 as leg in one primitive Pythagorean triple (8,15,17) and in one non-primitive Pythagorean triple (6,8,10); so a(8)=1.
