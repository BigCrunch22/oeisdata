%N A328588 Numbers n for which A257993(A276086(A276086(n))) is larger than A257993(n), where A276086 converts the primorial base expansion of n into its prime product form, and A257993 returns the index of the least prime not present in its argument.
%C A328588 Numbers n for which A328578(n) > A257993(n).
%C A328588 A047235 (numbers that are congruent to {2, 4} mod 6, thus even numbers that are not multiples of 3, with A257993(n) = 1) is a subsequence, because in primorial base (A049345) such numbers end with digits "10" or "20". A276086 will convert such a number to a number of the form p_k^e_k * ... * 7^b * 5^a * 3^{1,2} * 2^0 (an odd multiple of three, thus of the form 6k+3) which in primorial base will end with digits "11", thus on the second iteration A276086 will convert that to a number of the form p_k^e_k * ... * 7^b * 5^a * 3^1 * 2^1, with the least missing prime having an index (A257993) at least 3, which is larger than the original 1. Thus all terms of A047235 are included in this sequence.
