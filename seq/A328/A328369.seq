%N A328369 Numbers without repeated parts in their partitions into consecutive parts.
%C A328369 All primes are terms. - _Ivan N. Ianakiev_, Nov 05 2019
%C A328369 All powers of 2 are terms. - _Omar E. Pol_, Nov 19 2019
%e A328369 The partitions of 9 into consecutive parts are [9], [5, 4], [4, 3, 2]. The 4 is a repeated part, so 9 is not in the sequence.
%e A328369 The partitions of 10 into consecutive parts are [10], [4, 3, 2, 1]. There are no repeated parts, so 10 is in the sequence.
