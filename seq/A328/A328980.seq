%N A328980 Erroneous version of A328910: Number of solutions to Erdős's Last Equation in n variables.
%C A328980 The equation is x_1*x_2*...*x_n = n*(x_1+...+x_n) (n >= 2).
%C A328980 These are the terms are given as f(n) in a table on p. 803 in the cited paper. However, the sets C_L(n) of solutions with L+1 components > 1 can't be nonempty for L = n, as listed there for n = 2 and n = 3. The author (pers. comm.) confirms that a(2) = 2, a(3) = 6 and a(8) = 19. Sequence A328910 gives the correct terms. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 07 2019
%C A328980 Included in accordance with OEIS policy of including published but erroneous sequences to serve as pointers to the correct values.
