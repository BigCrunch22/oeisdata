%N A328971 Numerator of the fraction (hypotenuse - difference of legs) / (sum of legs - hypotenuse) of the n-th primitive Pythagorean triangle.
%C A328971 a(n) / A328972(n) should contain all reduced fractions between 1 and sqrt(2) + 1 without duplicates.
%C A328971 a(n) is built from the difference between the length of the hypotenuse (A020882) and the difference between the two legs (A120682) of the n-th primitive Pythagorean triangle.
%C A328971 A328972(n) (denominators) is built from the difference between the sum of the length of the legs (A120681) and the hypotenuse of the n-th primitive Pythagorean triangle.
%C A328971 Then both numbers are divided by their GCD to get the reduced fraction.
%C A328971 All primitive Pythagorean triangles are sorted first on hypotenuse, then on long leg.

%e A328971 For n=2 we need the 2nd primitive Pythagorean triangle:
%e A328971 5,12,13
%e A328971 ^  ^    We calculate the difference between the two small numbers: 12-5=7.
%e A328971       ^ And to get our numerator we subtract 7 from the hypotenuse length: 13-7=6.
%e A328971 ^  ^    Then we calculate the sum of the two small numbers: 5+12=17.
%e A328971       ^ We subtract 13 from this sum to get the denominator: 17-13=4.
%e A328971 This gives us the fraction 6/4, and in reduced form 3/2.
%Y A328971 Denominators: A328972.
