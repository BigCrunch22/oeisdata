%N A328825 Negative discriminants with form class group isomorphic to C_3 (negated).
%C A328825 Also negative discriminants with form class number 3.
%C A328825 Conjecture: this sequence is finite and this is the full list.
%C A328825 The fundamental terms are listed in A006203, and that is a full sequence.
%C A328825 From _Jianing Song_, May 17 2021: (Start)
%C A328825 Equivalently, negative discriminants of orders whose class group is isomorphic to C_3 (negated).
%C A328825 The known even terms are all congruent to 12 modulo 16. Among the known even terms, k/4 is either here or in A133675. What's the reason for that?
%C A328825 Among the known terms, k is in A023679 if and only if k is in this sequence and k/4 is not. Is there a connection between these two sequences? (End)
