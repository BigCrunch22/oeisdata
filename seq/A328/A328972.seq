%N A328972 Denominator of the fraction (hypotenuse - difference of legs) / (sum of legs - hypotenuse) of the n-th primitive Pythagorean triangle.
%C A328972 A328971(n) / a(n) should contain all reduced fractions between 1 and sqrt(2) +  1 without duplicates.
%C A328972 A328971(n) (numerators) is built from the difference between the length of the hypotenuse (A020882) and the difference between the two legs (A120682) of the n-th primitive Pythagorean triangle.
%C A328972 a(n) is built from the difference between the sum of the length of the legs (A120681) and the hypotenuse of the n-th primitive Pythagorean triangle.
%C A328972 Then both numbers are divided by their GCD to get the reduced fraction.
%C A328972 All primitive Pythagorean triangles are sorted first on hypotenuse, then on long leg.

%e A328972 For n=13 we need the 13th primitive Pythagorean triangle:
%e A328972 36,77,85
%e A328972 ^  ^     We calculate the difference between the two small numbers: 77-36=41.
%e A328972       ^  To get our numerator we subtract 41 from the hypotenuse length: 85-41=44.
%e A328972 ^  ^     Then we calculate the sum of the two small numbers: 36+77=113.
%e A328972       ^  We subtract 85 from this sum to get the denominator: 113-85=28.
%e A328972 This gives us the fraction 44/28 and in reduced form 11/7.
