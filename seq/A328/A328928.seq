%N A328928 Squares visited by a knight moving on a taxicab geometry numbered board where the knight moves to the smallest numbered unvisited square; the minimum distance from the origin is used if the square numbers are equal; the smallest spiral number ordering is used if the distances are equal.
%C A328928 This sequence uses the taxicab geometry distance from the 0-squared origin to enumerate each square on the board. At each step the knight goes to an unvisited square with the smallest square number. If the knight has a choice of two or more squares with the same number it then chooses the square which is the closest to the 0-squared origin. If two or more squares are found which also have the same distance to the origin, then the square which was first drawn in a square spiral numbering is chosen, i.e., the smallest spiral numbered square as in A316667.
%C A328928 The sequence is finite. After 1092366 steps a square with the number 728 (standard spiral number = 1165673) is visited, after which all neighboring squares have been visited.
