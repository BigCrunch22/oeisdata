%N A328413 Numbers k such that (Z/mZ)* = C_2 X C_(2k) has solutions m, where (Z/mZ)* is the multiplicative group of integers modulo m.
%C A328413 For n > 1, it is easy to see A114871(n)/2 is a term of this sequence. The smallest term here not of the form A114871(k)/2 is 24: 48 is not of the form (p-1)*p^k for any prime p, but (Z/mZ)* = C_2 X C_48 has solutions m = 119, 153, 238, 306.
%e A328413 (Z/mZ)* = C_2 X C_2 has solutions m = 8, 12; (Z/mZ)* = C_2 X C_4 has solutions m = 15, 16, 20, 30; (Z/mZ)* = C_2 X C_6 has solutions m = 21, 28, 36, 42; (Z/mZ)* = C_2 X C_8 has solutions m = 32; (Z/mZ)* = C_2 X C_10 has solutions m = 33, 44, 66; (Z/mZ)* = C_2 X C_12 has solutions m = 35, 39, 45, 52, 70, 78, 90. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are all terms.
