%N A328974 Trajectory of 1496 under repeated application of the map defined in A053392.
%C A328974 1496 is the smallest number whose trajectory under A053392 increases without limit.
%C A328974 More terms than usual are shown in order to display the onset of exponential growth.
%C A328974 Proof that this grows without limit, from _Hans Havermann_, Nov 01 2019: (Start)
%C A328974 One way to prove that the trajectory of a number under repeated application of the map defined in A053392 increases without limit is to show that there exists a term containing a non-final substring of three adjacent 9's.
%C A328974 If such a substring in term n is followed by a 0, it will grow to a non-final substring of three adjacent 9's followed by a 1 in term n+2: *9990* --> *18189* --> *99917*
%C A328974 If such a substring in term n is followed by a digit d that is neither 0 nor 9, it will grow to a non-final substring of four adjacent 9's in term n+2: *999d* --> *18181(d-1)* --> *9999d*
%C A328974 If such a substring in term n is followed by another 9, then it is a substring of k 9's for k >= 4, which will grow to a substring of (2k-3) 9's in term n+2: *[9]^d* --> *[18]^(d-1)* --> *[9]^(2d-3)*
%C A328974 Putting those together, such a substring in term n will grow to four adjacent 9's by term n+4; to five adjacent 9's by term n+6; to seven adjacent 9's by term n+8; ... to 2^k+3 adjacent 9's (see A062709) by term n+4+2k, regardless of what happens in the rest of the number.
%C A328974 In the present sequence a(41) contains two non-final substrings of three adjacent 9's. QED (End)
