%N A328077 Complement of A192110.
%C A328077 Note that, because A192110 assumes i <= 40, it is incorrect to say that the present sequence consists of "the positive integers that cannot be expressed as 2^m-3^n where m and n are integers".
%C A328077 This sequence is included because one way to remove the assumption i <= 40 from A192110 (and the fifty other unproved sequences of the same type) would be to show that the complements are correct, using the method used to prove the correctness of A173671.
