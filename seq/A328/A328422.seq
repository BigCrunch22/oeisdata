%N A328422 Number of paths from 2 to n via maps of the form x -> x + x^j, where j is a nonnegative integer.
%C A328422 This sequence is essentially the same as the number of paths from 1 to n. However, starting from 2 removes the ambiguity of how many maps there are from 1 to 2.
%C A328422 a(2n+1) = a(2n) for all n because x + x^j is odd if and only if x is even and j = 0.

%F A328422 a(2) = 1, a(n) = Sum_{k=1..A309978(n)} a(A328446(n,k)) for n > 2.
%e A328422 For n = 8 the a(8) = 6 paths are:
