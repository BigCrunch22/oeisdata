%N A328897 Odd numbers k > 1 such that A005179(k-1) > A005179(k) < A005179(k+1).
%C A328897 As only square numbers have an odd number of divisors, for odd k, A005179(k) is usually larger than either A005179(k-1) or A005179(k+1) (or both). This sequence lists the exceptions. There are 71 terms below 10^3, 963 terms below 10^4, 11179 terms below 10^5. It seems that the density of this sequence over all the odd numbers is > 0.2.
%C A328897 Is there any odd k such that A005179(k) is smaller than A005179(k-3), A005179(k-1), A005179(k+1) and A005179(k+3)? There is no such k < 10^5.

%e A328897 27 is a term because the smallest number with 27 divisors is 900, which is smaller than both A005179(26) = 12288 and A005179(28) = 960, so 27 is a term.
%e A328897 45 is a term because the smallest number with 45 divisors is 3600, which is smaller than both A005179(44) = 15360 and A005179(46) = 12582912, so 45 is a term.
