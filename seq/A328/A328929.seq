%N A328929 Squares visited by a knight moving on a square-ringed numbered board where the knight moves to the smallest numbered unvisited square; the minimum distance from the origin is used if the square numbers are equal; the smallest spiral number ordering is used if the distances are equal.
%C A328929 This sequence uses the number of the square ring of squares surrounding the 0-numbered origin to enumerate each square on the board. At each step the knight goes to an unvisited square with the smallest square number. If the knight has a choice of two or more squares with the same number it then chooses the square which is the closest to the 0-squared origin. If two or more squares are found which also have the same distance to the origin, then the square which was first drawn in a square spiral numbering is chosen, i.e., the smallest spiral numbered square as in A316667.
%C A328929 The sequence is finite. After 25108 steps a square with the number 73 (standard spiral number = 21041) is visited, after which all neighboring squares have been visited.

Blue dots show the eight occupied squares surrounding the final square; the final square is on the boundary at about the 4:30 clock position.
