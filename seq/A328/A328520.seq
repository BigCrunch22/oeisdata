%N A328520 GCD of terms in A002182 that have n prime factors counted with multiplicity.
%C A328520 If for every term t > 1 in A002182 there exists a term in A002182 of the form t/p for some prime p|t (Cf. A328523) then (1): a(n+1) is a multiple of a(n) for n >= 1 and (2): this sequence can be used to find terms to A199337 and A330737.
%C A328520 Proof of (1): Let Generation(n) be the terms in A002182 with n prime factors counted with multiplicity. Then a(n) = GCD(Generation(n)). As each term in Generation(n) is of the form a(n) * t for some t and each term in Generation(n + 1) is p * g for some g in Generation(n), a(n + 1) is a multiple of a(n).
%C A328520 Proof of (2): As a(n + 1) is a multiple of a(n) we have that if m | a(n), we also have m | a(n + k), k >= 0 hence the largest number not divisible by m can have at most n - 1 prime factors counted with multiplicity.
%C A328520 Given Generation(n) we can find all candidates for Generation(n + 1) and from there on find terms to A002182, A199337 and A330737.
%e A328520 The terms in A002182 with n = 4 prime divisors counted with multiplicity are 24, 36 and 60. Their GCD is 12 hence a(4) = 12.
%e A328520 Furthermore, If for every term t > 1 in A002182 there exists a term in A002182 of the form t/p for some prime p|t then we have that each term with more than 4 prime divisors counted with multiplicity is a multiple of at least one of 24, 36 or 60 hence is divisible by 12.
