%N A328950 Numerators for the "Minimum-Redundancy Code" card problem.
%C A328950 Given a deck of cards consisting of one 1, two 2's, three 3's, ..., n n's, what's the best average number of yes-or-no questions needed to ask to determine a randomly drawn card?  The answer is the above sequence divided by the number of cards (A000217).
%C A328950 The problem can be solved using Huffman codes.
%C A328950 This problem was popularized in Martin Gardner's Scientific American "Mathematical Games" column, and was included in his book "My Best Mathematical and Logic Puzzles".

%e A328950 For n=2, there are 3 cards, so a(2)/3 = 3/3 = 1 question is needed on average.
%e A328950 For n=3, there are 6 cards, so a(3)/6 = 9/6 = 1.5 questions are needed on average.
