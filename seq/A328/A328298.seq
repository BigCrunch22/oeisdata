%N A328298 The smaller prime in the decomposition of 2n (>=6) into a sum of two odd primes obtained from increasing the smaller prime of such a decomposition of 2n-2.
%C A328298 This sequence is different from A002374 from the 23rd term on.
%e A328298 For the 3rd even number 6, 6=3+3;
%e A328298 For the 4th number 8, increasing the first prime in 6=3+3 by 2, we get 8=5+3, 5 and 3 are both primes, choose the smaller one, the second term of this sequence is 3, which makes 8=3+5;
%e A328298 ...
%e A328298 For the 23rd even number 46, increasing the first prime in 44=13+31 by 2, we get 46=15+31.  15 is not prime, keep increasing: 46=17+29.  Both 17 and 29 are primes, so the 23rd term of this sequence is 17, as of 46=17+29;
%e A328298 ...
%e A328298 For 28th even number 56, increasing the first prime in 54=23+31 by 2, we get 56=25+31.  25 is not prime, keep increasing, 56 = 27+29 = 29+27 = 31+25 = 33+23 = 35+21 = 37+19.  Both 37 and 19 are primes, and 19 is smaller.  So the 28th term of this sequence is 19, as of 56=19+37.
