%e A328304 4 = 2^2 is cubefree but not squarefree, and its arithmetic derivative A003415(4) = 4 is not squarefree, thus 4 is included in this sequence.
%e A328304 225 = 3^2 * 5^2 is cubefree but not squarefree, and its arithmetic derivative A003415(225) = 240 = 2^4 * 3 * 5 is not squarefree, thus 225 is included in this sequence.
