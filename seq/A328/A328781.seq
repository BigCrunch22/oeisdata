%N A328781 Nonnegative integers k such that k and k^2 contain the same number of zero digits in their decimal expansion.
%C A328781 Inspired by A328780.
%C A328781 This sequence is not a duplicate of A052040. The first 72 terms until 96 are exactly the same but a(73) = 104 belongs to this sequence because 104^2 = 10816, but 104 doesn't belong to A052040 because there is one zero digit in the decimal expansion of 104^2.
%C A328781 The nonnegative integers that do not belong to this sequence are divided into three sequences:
%C A328781 1) A104315 = A052040 \ {this sequence}: Numbers k such that k contains at least one zero, but k^2 contains no zero (e.g., 106 with 106^2 = 11236).
%C A328781 2) A134844 = Numbers k such that k contains no zero but k^2 contains at least one zero (e.g., 32 with 32^2 = 1024).
%C A328781 3) A328783 = Numbers k such that k and k^2 contain at least one zero but not the same number of zeros (e.g., 101 with 101^2 = 10201).
%C A328781 Another sequence is A328782 = {this sequence} \ A052040 which lists the positive integers that have the same positive number of zeros in their decimal expansions as in their squares. The first two examples > 0 are 104 with 104^2 = 10816 and 105 with 105^2 = 11025.

%e A328781 12 and 144 = 12^2 have no digit zero in their decimal representation, so 12 is a term.
%e A328781 203 and 41209 = 203^2 both have one digit zero in their decimal representation, so 203 is also a term.
