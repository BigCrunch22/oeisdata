%N A328448 Smallest number whose divisors > 1 have a longest run of length n, and 0 if none exists.
%e A328448 The runs of divisors of 504 (greater than 1) are {{2,3,4},{6,7,8,9},{12},{14},{18},{21},{24},{28},{36},{42},{56},{63},{72},{84},{126},{168},{252},{504}}, the longest of which has length 4, and 504 is the smallest number with this property, so a(4) = 504.
%Y A328448 The version that looks at all divisors (including 1) is A328449.
%Y A328448 The longest run of divisors of n greater than 1 has length A328457.
%Y A328448 Numbers whose divisors > 1 have no non-singleton runs are A088725.
%Y A328448 The number of successive pairs of divisors of n is A129308(n).
%Y A328448 The Heinz number of the multiset of run-lengths of divisors of n is A328166(n).
