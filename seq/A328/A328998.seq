%N A328998 Primes that never appear as sums of terms in successive triples in A329333.
%C A328998 Sort A328997, remove duplicates, then list the missing primes.
%C A328998 Since we know that the first 20000 terms of A329333 are distinct, in order to show that a prime p is missing from the sums of pairs of terms of A329333, we only need to check until the terms of A329333 exceed p.
%e A328998 A329333 begins 0, 1, 2, 7, 3, 6, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 9, 12, 14, 15, 13, 18, 17, 19, 20, ...
%e A328998 so we see the primes 2, 3, 5, 13, 7, 11, 13, 13, ...  But we do not see 17, and once we have seen all the numbers below 17 in A329333, we know 17 will never appear as a sum of two terms.
