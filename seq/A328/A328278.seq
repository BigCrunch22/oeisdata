%N A328278 a(1) = 4. For n > 1, a(n) is the smallest composite number not yet in the sequence that has a divisor in common with a(n-1) other than the largest proper divisor of a(n-1).
%C A328278 A more explicit (but longer) Name is: a(1) = 4. For n > 1, a(n) is the composite determined as follows:  exclude the largest proper divisor of a(n-1), and of the remaining divisors > 1 of a(n-1) select one such that a(n) is the smallest composite number not yet in the sequence that has this divisor in common with a(n-1).
%C A328278 By definition of the sequence, the divisors of a(n-1) used to determine a(n) are either primes or powers of primes.
%e A328278 a(2) = 8 since after excluding 2, which is the largest proper divisor of a(1) = 4, the only remaining divisor > 1 of 4 is 4, and a(2) = 8 is the smallest composite not yet in the sequence that shares this divisor with a(1) = 4.
%e A328278 a(6) = 9 since after excluding 6, which is the largest proper divisor of a(5) = 12, among the remaining divisors > 1 of 12 are 2 and 3; if 2 is selected, a(6) = 14, and if 3 is selected, a(6) = 9, so 3 is selected and a(6) = 9.
%e A328278 a(7) = 18 since after excluding 3, which the largest proper divisor of a(6) = 9, the only remaining divisor > 1 of 9 is 9, and a(7) = 18 is the smallest composite not yet in the sequence that shares this divisor with a(6) = 9.
%e A328278 Note that after excluding the largest proper divisor of a(n-1), not always the smallest divisor > 1 of a(n-1) is selected to determine a(n), as a(6) shows.
