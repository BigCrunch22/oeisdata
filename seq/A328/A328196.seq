%N A328196 First differences of A328190.
%C A328196 Conjecture from _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 05 2019: (Start)
%C A328196 a(4t) = 5t+1(+1 if binary expansion of t ends in odd number of 0's) for t >= 1,
%C A328196 a(4t+1) = -(5t-2(+1 if binary expansion of t ends in odd number of 0's)) for t >= 1,
%C A328196 a(4t+2) = 5t+4 for t >= 0,
%C A328196 a(4t+3) = -(5t+2) for t >= 0.
%C A328196 These formulas explain all the known terms.
%C A328196 a(2t) is closely related to A298468. The expressions for a(4t) and a(4t+1) can also be written in terms of A328979.
%C A328196 The conjecture would establish that the terms lie on two straight lines, of slopes +-5/4.
%C A328196 There is a similar conjecture for A328190. (End)
