%N A328616 Number of digits in primorial base expansion of n that are maximal possible in their positions.

%F A328616 For all n >= 1, a(A057588(n)) = n.
%e A328616 In primorial base (see A049345), the maximum digit value that can occur in the k-th position from the right (with k=1 standing for the rightmost, i.e., the least significant digit position) is A000040(k)-1, and it is for the terms of A057588 (primorial numbers minus one) where all significant digits are maximal allowed for their positions, e.g. 209 is written as "6421" because 209 = 6*30 + 4*6 + 2*2 + 1*1, thus a(209) = 4.
%e A328616 87 is written as "2411" because 87 = 2*A002110(3) + 4*A002110(2) + 1*A002110(1) + 1*A002110(0) = 2*30 + 4*6 + 1*2 + 1*1. Only the digit positions 1 and 3 are occupied with maximum digits allowed in those positions (that are 1 and 4, being one less than the corresponding primes, 2 and 5), thus a(87) = 2.
