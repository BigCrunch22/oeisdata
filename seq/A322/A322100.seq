%N A322100 Number of minimal transitive permutation groups of degree n.
%C A322100 A transitive group is minimal provided it has no proper transitive subgroups.

%e A322100 There are two transitive groups of degree 3, A_3 and S_3, so A002106(3)=2. However, a(3)=1, because A_3 is minimal, but S_3 has proper transitive subgroups A_3 and S_2.
%Y A322100 Cf. A002106.
