%N A322689 Three-column table read by rows: Primitive distinct triples that have the same value of phi, sigma, and tau.
%C A322689 The terms are consecutive triples, ordered so that (A) a(3i-2) < a(3i-1) < a(3i), and (B) a(3i-2) < a(3j-2) for i < j.  This sequence has primitive terms only.  If k is relatively prime to all of the terms in a primitive triple, then multiplying the terms in that triple by k gives another solution - see A322679.

%e A322689 phi(63048) = phi(67122) = phi(70818) = 20160, sigma(63048) = sigma(67122) = sigma(70818) = 164160, tau(63048) = tau(67122) = tau(70818) = 32, so 63048, 67122, and 70818 are in the sequence.
