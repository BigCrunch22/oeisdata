%N A322125 Minimum number of shaded cells in an n X n Hitori solution grid.
%C A322125 Cells are shaded in an n*n grid, such that
%C A322125   - Unshaded cells are orthogonally connected.
%C A322125   - Shaded cells cannot touch orthogonally.
%C A322125   - Shading any unshaded cells will break one (or both) of the rules above.
%C A322125 In the original Hitori puzzle, the last rule is not required.
%C A322125 Subsequent terms a(8), a(9), a(10) are at most 15, 19, 24.
%C A322125 a(n) is at most n^2/5 + o(n^2). This bound can be obtained by shading (x,y) where x+2y is divisible by 5 followed by adjustments on the edges.
%F A322125 a(n) <= A321684(n). - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Jan 14 2019
%e A322125 Case n=4: A solution with the minimum number of shaded cells is:
%e A322125    X . X .
%e A322125    . . . .
%e A322125    X . . X
%e A322125    . . . .
%e A322125 In the above, no additional cell can be shaded without either placing it adjacent to another shaded cell or causing the unshaded cells to become disconnected.
