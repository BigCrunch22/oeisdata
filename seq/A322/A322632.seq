%N A322632 Decimal expansion of the real solution to 23*x^5 - 41*x^4 + 10*x^3 - 6*x^2 - x - 1 = 0. Constant occurring in the asymptotic behavior of the number of lattice paths of slope 2/5, observed by D. Knuth.
%C A322632 In his 2014 lecture in Paris "Problems That Philippe (Flajolet) Would Have Loved" D. Knuth discussed as Problem 4 "Lattice Paths of Slope 2/5" and reported as an empirical observation that A[5*t-1,2*t-1]/B[5*t-1,2*t-1] = a - b/t + O(t^-2), with constants a~=1.63026 and b~=0.159. For the meaning of A and B see A322631. The exact values of a (this sequence) and b (A322633) were found in 2016 by Banderier and Wallner.
