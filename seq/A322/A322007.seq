%N A322007 a(n) = number of primes of the form p = 2n - q, where q is a prime or semiprime.
%C A322007 Related to Chen's theorem (Chen 1966, 1973) which states that every sufficiently large even number is the sum of a prime and another prime or semiprime. Yamada (2015) has proved that this holds for all even numbers larger than exp(exp(36)).
%C A322007 In terms of this sequence, Chen's theorem with Yamada's bound is equivalent to say that a(n) > 0 for all n > 1.7 * 10^1872344071119348 (exponent ~ 1.8*10^15).
%C A322007 A235645 lists the number of decompositions of 2n into a prime p and a prime or semiprime q; this is less than a(n) because p + q and q + p is the same decomposition (if q is a prime), but this sequence will count two distinct primes 2n - q and 2n - p (if q <> p).
%C A322007 Sequence A322006 lists the same for even and odd numbers n, not only for even numbers 2n.

%F A322007 a(n) = A322006(2n).
%e A322007 a(4) = 2 since for n = 4, 2n = 8 = 2 + 6 = 3 + 5 = 5 + 3, i.e., primes 2, 3 and 5 are of the form specified in the definition (since 6 = 2*3 is a semiprime and 5 and 3 are primes).
