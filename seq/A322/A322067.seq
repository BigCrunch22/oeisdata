%N A322067 Size of the free distributive lattice on the meet semilattice of partitions.
%e A322067 n=1: There is one partition of {1}, and the free distributive lattice on this (the unique) one-element meet-semilattice has a(1)=2 elements.
%e A322067 n=2: There are two partitions of {1,2}, and the free distributive lattice on this (the unique) two-element meet-semilattice has a(2)=3 elements.
%e A322067 n=3: There are five partitions of {1,2,3}, and the free distributive lattice on the meet semilattice {123, 12, 23, 13, top) has a(3)=10 elements.
%e A322067 n=4: There are 15 partitions of {1,2,3,4}, and the free distributive lattice on this meet-semilattice has
