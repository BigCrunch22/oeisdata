%N A322447 Numbers k where Sum_{d | k} 1/rad(d) increases to a record.
%C A322447 Let rad(n) be the radical of n, which equals the product of all prime factors of n (A007947). Let g(n) = 1/rad(n) and let f(n) = Sum_{d | n} g(d). This is a multiplicative function whose value on a prime power is f(p^k) = 1 + k/p. Hence f is a weighted divisor-counting function that weights divisors d higher when they have few and small prime divisors themselves. This sequence lists the values where f(n) increases to a record, analogously to highly composite numbers (A002182) or superabundant numbers (A004394). The numbers in this sequence are much smoother than those in the other two sequences, since the definition of f(n) strongly disfavors a lack of smoothness in n.

%e A322447 The divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12, so f(12) = 1 + (1/2) + (1/3) + (1/2) + (1/6) + (1/6) = 8/3, which exceeds f(n) for n = 1,...,11. Alternately, since f is multiplicative, f(12) = f(4)*f(3) = (1+2/2)*(1+1/3).
%e A322447 f(207360) = f(2^9)*f(3^4)*f(5) = (11/2)*(7/3)*(6/5) = 15.4, which exceeds f(n) for n < 207360. (Note that this is the first value of the sequence that is divisible by 5; earlier values are all 3-smooth.)
