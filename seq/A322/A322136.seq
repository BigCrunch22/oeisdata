%N A322136 Numbers whose number of prime factors counted with multiplicity exceeds half their sum of prime indices by at least 1.
%C A322136 The Heinz number of an integer partition (y_1, ..., y_k) is prime(y_1) * ... * prime(y_k). The sequence lists all Heinz numbers of integer partitions where the number of parts is at least 1 plus half the sum of parts.
%C A322136 Also Heinz numbers of integer partitions that are the vertex-degrees of some hypertree. We allow no singletons in a hypertree, so 2 is not included.
%e A322136 The sequence of partitions with Heinz numbers in the sequence begins: (11), (111), (211), (1111), (2111), (11111), (2211), (3111), (21111), (111111), (22111), (31111), (211111), (22211), (41111), (32111), (1111111).
