%N A322466 Lexicographically first sequence of distinct terms such that the a(n)th digit after a(n) shares a(n)'s parity.
%C A322466 This sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A322466 The sequence starts with 1,3,4,2,5,6,8,9,7,10,20,12,...
%e A322466 a(1) = 1 forces the next digit to be odd;
%e A322466 Thus a(2) = 3 as this 3 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction; this 3 forces the 3rd digit after 3 to be odd;
%e A322466 Could a(3) be equal to 2 (instead of 4, here)? No, because this would lead to a contradiction as we've just seen that the 3rd digit after 3 must be odd;
%e A322466 Thus a(3) = 4; this 4 forces the 4th digit after 4 to be even;
%e A322466 a(4) = 2 as this 2 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction; this 2 forces the 2nd digit after 2 to be even;
%e A322466 a(5) = 5 as the first digit of a(5) must be odd and 5 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction; this 5 forces the 5th digit after 5 to be odd;
%e A322466 a(6) = 6 as the first digit of a(6) must be even and 6 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction; this 6 forces the 6th digit after 6 to be even;
%e A322466 a(7) = 8 as the first digit of a(7) must be even and 8 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction; this 8 forces the 8th digit after 8 to be even;
%e A322466 Could a(8) be equal to 7 (instead of 9, here)? No, because this would lead to a contradiction as we've just seen that the 8th digit after 8 must be even;
%e A322466 Thus a(8) = 9 as this 9 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction; this 9 forces the 9th digit after 9 to be odd;
%e A322466 a(9) = 7 as this 7 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction; this 7 forces the 7th digit after 7 to be odd;
%e A322466 a(10) = 10 as the smallest available integer starting with an even digit and not leading to a contradiction is 10; this 10 forces the 10th digit after 10 to be even;
%e A322466 a(11) = 20 as the smallest available integer starting with an even digit and not leading to a contradiction is 20; this 20 forces the 10th digit after 20 to be even;
%e A322466 a(12) = 12 as the smallest available integer ending with an even digit and not leading to a contradiction is 12; this 12 forces the 12th digit after 12 to be even;
