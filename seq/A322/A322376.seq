%N A322376 Positive integers k that are the sum of divisors of some positive integer but there exists no divisor d where 1 < d, k/d of k such that d and k/d have this property.
%C A322376 Also number k such that k is in A002191 but there is no divisor d where 1 < d, k/d of k such that both d and k/d are in A002191. A002191 is closed under multiplication with terms in this sequence as primitive terms.
%e A322376 4 is in A002191 as sigma(3) = 4 but no divisor of 4 as described above exists. The only candidate is 2 but 2 isn't in A002191.
