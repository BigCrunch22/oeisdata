%N A322633 Decimal expansion of the real solution to 11571875*x^5 - 5363750*x^4 + 628250*x^3 - 97580*x^2 + 5180*x - 142 = 0, multiplied by 3/7. Constant occurring in the asymptotic behavior of the number of lattice paths of slope 2/5, observed by D. Knuth.
%C A322633 In his 2014 lecture in Paris "Problems That Philippe (Flajolet) Would Have Loved" D. Knuth discussed as Problem 4 "Lattice Paths of Slope 2/5" and reported as an empirical observation that A[5*t-1,2*t-1]/B[5*t-1,2*t-1] = a - b/t + O(t^-2), with constants a~=1.63026 and b~=0.159. For the meaning of A and B see A322631. The exact values of a (A322632) and b (this sequence) were found in 2016 by Banderier and Wallner.
