%N A322467 Lexicographically first sequence of distinct terms such that a(n) is duplicated a(n) digits to the right.
%C A322467 This sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A322467 The sequence starts with 1,10,2,3,20,30,5,6,4,105,...
%e A322467 a(1) = 1 forces the next digit to be 1;
%e A322467 a(2) = 10 as 10 is the smallest available integer starting with 1 and not leading to a contradiction; this 10 will be duplicated 10 digits to the right;
%e A322467 a(3) = 2 as 2 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction; this 2 will be duplicated 2 digits to the right;
%e A322467 a(4) = 3 as 3 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction; this 3 will be duplicated 3 digits to the right;
%e A322467 a(5)= 20 as 20 is the smallest available integer starting with 2 and not leading to a contradiction; this 20 will be duplicated 20 digits to the right;
%e A322467 a(6) = 30 as 30 is the smallest available integer starting with 3 and not leading to a contradiction; this 30 will be duplicated 30 digits to the right;
%e A322467 Could a(7) be equal to 4? No, because this 4 cannot be duplicated 4 digits to the right as there is already a 0 there (this 0 comes from the duplicated 10);
%e A322467 Thus a(7) = 5 as 5 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction; this 5 will be duplicated 5 digits to the right;
%e A322467 Could a(8) be equal to 4? No, because this 4 cannot be duplicated 4 digits to the right as there is already a 5 there (this 5 comes from the duplicated 5);
%e A322467 Thus a(8) = 6 as 6 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction; this 6 will be duplicated 6 digits to the right;
%e A322467 a(9) = 4 as 4 is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction; this 4 will be duplicated 4 digits to the right;
%e A322467 a(10) = 105 as 105 is the smallest available integer starting with 10, followed by 5, and not leading to a contradiction; this 105 will be duplicated 105 digits to the right.
