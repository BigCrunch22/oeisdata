%N A322001 Digits of n interpreted in factorial base: a(Sum d_k*10^k) = Sum d_k*k!
%C A322001 More terms than usual are given to distinguish the sequence from A081594, A028897 and A244158, which agree up to a(99). The last two correspond to k! replaced by 2^k resp. Catalan(k).
%C A322001 This is a left inverse to A007623 (factorial base representation of n): A322001(A007623(n)) = n for all n >= 0. One could imagine variants which have a(n) = 0 or a(n) = -1 if n is not a term of A007623. Restricted to the range of A007623, it is also a right inverse to A007623, at least up to the 10 digit terms, beyond which A007623 becomes non-injective.
