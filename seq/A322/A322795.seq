%N A322795 Number of integers k, 0 <= k <= n, such that the Damerau-Levenshtein distance between the binary representations of n and k is strictly less than the Levenshtein distance.
%C A322795 a(n) = 0 if and only if n appears in A099627 or n = 0.
%C A322795 a(n) = A079071(n) for n <= 21, but a(22) = 3 > 2 = A079071(22).

%e A322795 For n = 6, the Damerau-Levenshtein distance and the Levenshtein distance between the binary representations of n and k are equal for all k <= n except k = 5. The Levenshtein distance between 101 and 110 (5 and 6 in binary) is 2, whereas the Damerau-Levenshtein distance is 1, so a(6) = 1.
