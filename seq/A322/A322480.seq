%N A322480 Irregular triangular array read by rows: T(n,k), n>=1, is the number of ordered factorizations corresponding to each unordered factorization, indexed by k.
%C A322480 The method of indexing the unordered factorizations of n in this array is as follows: take all unordered factorizations of n and write them with their factors in nonincreasing order (e.g., 2*4*5*3 becomes 5*4*3*2), and order these reverse-lexicographically (e.g., for 12: 12, 6*2, 4*3, 3*2*2), then assign the index k to the k-th factorization in this ordering.
%C A322480 For a sequence f with Dirichlet inverse f^(-1), f^(-1)(n) is the sum over all multisets M of integers > 1 with product n, of the product of the terms f(m) with indices m in M (counted with multiplicity) multiplied by T(n,k)*(-1)^c/f(1)^(c+1) where c = |M| and T(n,k) corresponds to M.
%C A322480 The multiset of entries in the n-th row is determined by the prime signature of n.
%C A322480 For the p^j-th row with p a prime, the entries give the number of compositions of j corresponding to each partition of j, indexed by k in an analogous manner, given by the j-th row of A048996.

%e A322480 The 12th row is 1,2,2,3, because 12 can be factored as 12, 6*2, 3*4 or 3*2*2 with respective sets of ordered factorizations {12}, {6*2, 2*6}, {4*3, 3*4} and {3*2*2, 2*3*2, 2*2*3}, with respective cardinalities 1, 2, 2 and 3.
