%N A322121 Composite numbers m such that b^(m-1) == 1 (mod (b^2-1)*m) has a solution b.
%C A322121 The smallest solutions b are 7, 18, 8, 13, 3, 3, 57, 11, ...
%C A322121 These numbers m are odd and indivisible by 3.
%C A322121 They contain all prime powers p^k for p > 3 and k > 1.
%C A322121 It seems that, for a fixed integer k > 0, these are composite numbers m such that c^(m-1) == 1 (mod (c^2-1)m^k) for some base c.
%C A322121 Conjecture: If m is a composite number such that b^(m-1) == 1 (mod (b^2-1)m) for some base b, then m is a strong pseudoprime to some base a in the range 2 <= a <= m-2. Thus, these numbers m are probably a proper subset of A181782.
