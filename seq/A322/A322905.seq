%N A322905 Sequence consists of all pairs of numbers x and y such that x is the reverse of y, and there exist numbers i and j such that x = i-j and y=i*j; the list of the numbers x and y is then sorted into ascending order and duplicates are removed.
%C A322905 The first term is trivial since 0-0=0*0=0. The pattern of 147 followed by blocks of 5247 followed by 5244 (and its reverse) continues indefinitely. This is also true for the pattern of 161247 followed by blocks of 5247 followed by 384 (and its reverse).

%F A322905 For some positive integer k, if n=4k, a(n)=-3+147*10^(4n)+53*(10^(4n)-1)/101; if n=4k+1, a(n)=441*10^(4n)+159*(10^(4n)-1)/101; if n=4k+2, a(n)=384+161247*10^(4n-1)+53*(10^(4n-1)-10^3)/101; if n=4k+3, a(n)=1161+483741*10^(4n-1)+159*(10^(4n-1)-10^3)/101. Note that the n-th term corresponds to that of the sequence, so the formulas are valid for n>3.
%e A322905 For instance, 147*3=441 and 147-3=144 are terms; 161247387*3=483742161 and 161247387-3=161247384 are terms too.
