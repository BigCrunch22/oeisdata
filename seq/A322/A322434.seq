%N A322434 Numbers k that are the numerator of a harmonic number such that k is divisible by the square of a prime >= 5.
%C A322434 From _Bernard Schott_, Dec 09 2018: (Start)
%C A322434 In the data, there are two families of numerators.
%C A322434 1) Numerators of harmonic numbers H_{p-1} which are divisible by p^2 for p >= 5, by Wolstenholme's theorem; these numerators are in A076637.
%C A322434 2) Numerators of harmonic numbers which are also divisible by squares of primes, but not as a result of Wolstenholme's theorem. E.g., the numbers 363, numerator of H_7, and 9227046511387, numerator of H_{29}, are respectively divisible by 11^2 and 43^2. Up through H_{60}, only the two numerators of H_7 and H_{29} belong to this second family.
%C A322434 (End)
%C A322434 The third term in the second family is the numerator of H_{297) ~ 1.153... * 10^129 which is divisible by 1153^2, and the fourth numerator of H_k has k > 335. - _Amiram Eldar_, Dec 09 2018
%C A322434 Numbers n <= 50000 such that 11^2 divides the numerator of the n-th harmonic number: 7, 10 (by Wolstenholme's theorem), 848, 9328, 9338, 10583, 10591, 102718, 102721, 102728, 116413, 116423. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Dec 09 2018

%e A322434 49 is a term because the numerator of the harmonic number H_6 = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 = 49/20 is divisible by the square of 7 (by Wolstenholme's Theorem).
%e A322434 363 is a term because the numerator of the harmonic number H_7 = 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6 + 1/7 = 363/140 is divisible by the square of 11.
