%N A322751 Number of directed graphs of 2*n vertices each having an in-degree and out-degree of 1 such that the graph specifies a pairwise connected gift exchange.
%C A322751 The sequence is the number of unique arrangements of directed graphs connecting 2*n vertices, where vertices occur in pairs, and meeting the following requirements:
%C A322751 1. Each vertex has an out-degree and in-degree of 1.
%C A322751 2. No edge connects vertices that are paired.
%C A322751 3. Starting with any pair, following the edges of paired vertices connects all vertices.
%C A322751 The requirements were chosen to yield a nice gift exchange between a set of couples. Acknowledgement to the additional members of the initial, inspirational gift exchange group: Cat, Brad, Kim, Ada, Graham, Nolan, and Leah.
%C A322751 The fraction of graphs meeting the requirements is approximately 0.12. Starting with n=2, the fractions are (0.166666667, 0.111111111, 0.116666667, 0.12042328, 0.122959756, 0.124807468). Is there a way to compute the percentage of graphs satisfying the condition in the limit as n approaches infinity?

%e A322751 For n = 1, there is one pair; a(1) = 0 since requirements 1 and 2 can't be satisfied.
%e A322751 For n = 2, there are two pairs; a(2) = 4 graphs given by these edge destinations:
