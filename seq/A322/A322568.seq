%N A322568 Integers k such that the least prime factor of 2^k - 1 is not in A122094.
%C A322568 Clearly, the terms are odd and composite (A071904).
%C A322568 The first term which is itself of form 2^j - 1 is 34359738367 = 2^35 - 1. The least prime factor of 2^34359738367 - 1 is 136463, and the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 136463 is 2201 = 31*71. In A309130, it is asked if a member of A322568 can be of form 2^p - 1 with p prime.
%e A322568 169 is included because the least prime factor of 2^169-1 is 4057, and the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 4057 is 169 which is not prime. The divisor 4057 is less than the "algebraic" divisor 2^13-1 = 8192 (Mersenne prime).
%e A322568 4199 (= 13*17*19) is included because the least prime factor of 2^4199-1 is 647, and the multiplicative order of 2 modulo 647 is 323 (= 17*19) which is not prime. The divisor 647 is less than the smallest "algebraic" divisor which is 2^13-1 = 8192 (Mersenne prime).
%e A322568 289 is NOT included; its least prime factor is 2^17 - 1.
%e A322568 1073 (= 29*37) is NOT included; its least prime factor is 223, but 223 is a divisor of one of the "algebraic" factors, namely 223 is a divisor of composite Mersenne number 2^37 - 1.
