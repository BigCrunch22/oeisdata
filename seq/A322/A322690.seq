%N A322690 Four-column table read by rows: Primitive distinct quadruples that have the same value of phi, sigma, and tau.
%C A322690 The terms are consecutive quadruples, ordered so that (A) a(4i-3) < a(4i-2) < a(4i-1) < a(4i) for i > 0, and (B) a(4i+1) < a(4i+5) for i >= 0.  This sequence has primitive terms only.  If k is relatively prime to all of the terms in a primitive quadruple, then multiplying the terms in that quadruple by k gives another solution - see A322680.

%e A322690 1167320, 1197912, 1275318, and 1345542 have the same value of phi (362880), sigma (3283200), and tau (64), so these four numbers are in the sequence.
