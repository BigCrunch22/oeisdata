%N A322692 Six-column table read by rows: Primitive distinct sextuples that have the same value of phi, sigma, and tau.
%C A322692 The terms are consecutive sextuples, ordered so that (A) a(6i-5) < a(6i-4) < ... < a(6i) for i > 0, and (B) a(6i+1) < a(6i+7) for i >= 0.  This sequence has primitive solutions only.  If k is relatively prime to all of the terms in a primitive sextuple, then multiplying the terms in that sextuple by k gives another solution - see A322682.
