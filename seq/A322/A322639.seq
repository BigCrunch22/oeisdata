%N A322639 Number of solutions to |dft(a)^2 + dft(b)^2 + dft(c)^2 + dft(d)^2| = 4n, where a,b,c,d are +1,-1 sequences of length n and dft(x) denotes the discrete Fourier transform of x.
%C A322639 Each solution (a,b,c,d) corresponds to a Hadamard matrix of quaternion type H = [[A, B, C, D], [-B, A, -D, C], [-C, D, A, -B], [-D, -C, B, A]], where A, B, C and D are circulant matrices formed by a, b, c and d, respectively.
%C A322639 16 is a divisor of a(n), for all n. If (a,b,c,d) is a solution, then each of the 16 tuples ((+-)a, (+-)b, (+-)c, (+-)d) is also a solution.
%C A322639 a(n) >= A321338(n). Every solution (a,b,c,d) that is counted by A321338(n) is also counted by a(n).
