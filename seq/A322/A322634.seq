%N A322634 Sum of attendance numbers of all histories of length 5*n in the Bizley-Duchon's club model, divided by 5.
%C A322634 The Bizley-Duchon's club model is equivalent to the lattice paths from (0,0) to (3*n,2*n) described in A293946. The attendance history of the club consists of persons entering in pairs and leaving in groups of three. The club closes when no persons are remaining. a(k)/A293946(k) is proportional to the mean area under the "filling level curve" of the club.
%C A322634 Banderier et al. show that the mean area is asymptotic to K*n^(3/2), with K=(1/2)*(15*Pi)^(1/2).
