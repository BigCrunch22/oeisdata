%N A322572 Start with a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2. Thereafter, if a(n) is prime, a(n+1) = a(n) + 1. If a(n) is composite, look for its greatest factor other than itself (k, say) earlier in the sequence. If k is found, a(n+1) = a(n) + the number of steps back to the most recent appearance of k. If k is not found, a(n+1) = a(n) - k.
%C A322572 It is unknown whether every natural number eventually appears in the sequence, but some have notably late entry points. For instance, a(n) = 28 for the first time (possibly only time) at n = 582. 280 first appears at n = 16175. 508 and 624 are the only values less than 1000 that do not appear in the first 50000 terms. After n = 4, the first time a(n) = n is at term 766. Thereafter, a(n) = n at 1952, 4682, 6367, 6368, and not again within the first 50000 terms.
