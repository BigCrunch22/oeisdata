%N A322322 Stuffable numbers (see the Comments section for definition).
%C A322322 For given n > 9, consider integers k whose number of digits equals the sum of digits of n minus its last digit. If (d[i])_{i=1..N} are the digits of n, let S(n,k) be the result of inserting d[i] digits of k after the i-th digit of n, i = 1, ..., N-1. If S(n,k) is divisible by k, then n is called a stuffable number. Let s(n) be the set of all such k, for given n. If s(n) has m elements, then n is called m-stuffable. If n is in s(n), n is called self-stuffable. See A322323 for the list of all self-stuffable numbers.
%C A322322 More generally, any n = 10^r + s with 0 <= s <= 9 is in the sequence, since it can be "stuffed" with k = 1, i.e., S(n,1) = 11*10^r + s is divisible by 1.
%C A322322 From _David A. Corneth_, Jan 19 2019: (Start)
%C A322322 The following is a heuristic for finding terms. Let f be a value such that f * "stuffable number" = "stuffed number." For the example 2018, f = 15663. If a number is stuffable, we can find lower and upper bounds on f. For each f in that interval we test if some stuff could produce that f.
%C A322322 We then start with stuff of the form 10^k and update the "stuff" and "stuffable" until we know f can't produce a stuffable.
%C A322322 For 2018 we know floor(2990198 / 999) = 2993 <= f <= 21002 = ceiling(2100108/100).
%C A322322 The iterations with stuff and stuffed respectively look as follows, for f = 3108:
%C A322322 100  2100108
%C A322322 676  2670168
%C A322322 860  2860108
%C A322322 921  2920118
%C A322322 940  2940108
%C A322322 2018: 2940168 =  946 * 3108
%C A322322 The heuristic as is needs modifications to become an algorithm. (End)

%e A322322 We explain what a "stuffable number" is with an example. Take 2018 and "open" it like this: 2018 becomes 2..01.8 (two spaces after 2, no space after the 0, one space after 1, nothing after 8 -- and, in general, k spaces after each digit k, except for the last one).
%e A322322 One then "pushes" an integer into the empty spaces; here, for instance, we push 136 and 2..01.8 becomes 2130168.
%e A322322 Let's call 136 the stuff, and 2130168 the stuffed number. If the stuffed number is divisible by the stuff, we will call the starting integer a "stuffable number".
%e A322322 This is the case for 2018, as 2130168 divided by 136 gives 15663.
%e A322322 Remark: no stuff can begin with a leading zero.
%e A322322 Simpler examples are given by the first terms of this sequence:
%e A322322 10 is in the sequence as 10 will be "opened" as 1.0 and the dot can be filled by the integer 1 (as 1 divides 110).
%e A322322 11 through 19 are in the sequence for the same reason. (See also the second comment.)
%e A322322 Some stuffable numbers admit more than one stuff: for instance, 20 becomes 2..0 and the 6 following stuffed numbers are divisible by their respective stuffs:
%e A322322 2100 divided by 10 is 210
%e A322322 2160 divided by 16 is 135
%e A322322 2200 divided by 20 is 110
%e A322322 2250 divided by 25 is 90
%e A322322 2400 divided by 40 is 60
%e A322322 2500 divided by 50 is 50
%e A322322 2800 divided by 80 is 35
%e A322322 So, 20 can be filled with any of the seven 2-digit numbers {10, 16, 20, 25, 40, 50, 80}. We could say that 20 is a 7-stuffable number, as 7 stuffs are possible for 20.
%e A322322 21 is in the sequence as 21 will be opened as 2..1 and the dots can be filled by the integer 23, as 23 divides 2231 with the result 97.
%e A322322 22 is in the sequence as 22 will be opened as 2..2 and the dotes can be filled by the integer 11, as 11 divides 2112 with the result 192.
%e A322322 23 is not in the sequence as 23 will be opened as 2..3 and no integer k from 10 to 99 will divide 2k3;
