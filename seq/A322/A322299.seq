%N A322299 Number of distinct automorphism group sizes for binary self-dual codes of length 2n.
%C A322299 Codes are vector spaces with a metric defined on them.  Specifically, the metric is the hamming distance between two vectors.  Vectors of a code are called codewords.
%C A322299 A code is usually represented by a generating matrix.  The row space of the generating matrix is the code itself.
%C A322299 Self-dual codes are codes such all codewords are pairwise orthogonal to each other.
%C A322299 Two codes are called permutation equivalent if one code can be obtained by permuting the coordinates (columns) of the other code.
%C A322299 The automorphism group of a code is the set of permutations of the coordinates (columns) that result in the same identical code.

%e A322299 There are a(16) = 388 distinct sizes for the automorphism groups of the binary self-dual codes of length 16.  In general, two automorphism  groups with the same size are not necessarily isomorphic.
