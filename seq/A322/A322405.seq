%N A322405 Number of compositions of n into parts 1, 8, 9.
%C A322405 Suppose A is a subset of {1..n} having the following property: if A includes an integer k, then A includes none of the integers k+2, k+3, k+4, k+5, k+6 or k+7. The number of subsets having this property is a(n+7).
%C A322405 The terms of this sequence also give us the answer to the following coloring problem: suppose that, given an n-section board, if we paint the k-th section, we can't paint the (k+2)-th, (k+3)-th, (k+4)-th, (k+5)-th, (k+6)-th or (k+7)-th section. In how many different ways can we paint this n-section board (where painting none of the sections is considered one of the ways)? Similarly the answer is a(n+7).
%H A322405 <a href="/index/Rec#order_09">Index entries for linear recurrences with constant coefficients</a>, signature (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1).
%F A322405 a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-8) + a(n-9) for n > 8.
%F A322405 G.f.: 1/(1 - x - x^8 - x^9).

%e A322405 For n=3 so {1,2,3}, the answer is a(3+7) = a(10) = 6. Here are the subsets: {},{1},{2},{3},{1,2},{2,3}.
%e A322405 For n=4, the number of ways of painting a 4-section board is a(4+7)=a(11)=8; here are the 8 situations: {},{1},{2},{3},{4},{1,2},{2,3},{3,4}.
