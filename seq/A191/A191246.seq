%N A191246 Length of prefix cyclically shifted with permutations in cool-lex ordering.
%C A191246 Start with the identical permutation [0,1,2,...,n-1] and obtain the next permutation by cyclically shifting the prefix of length a(n) (n>=1) by one position to the right, see example. For every n the ordering is cyclic: the first permutation is a cyclic shift of the last when taking the prefix to be the full length n (instead of n+1 as the sequence gives).

%e A191246 Permutations of 4 elements, via cyclic prefix shifts.
%e A191246 The first permutation is the one used in the original algorithm, followed by the length of the prefix shifted, the second is the permutation starting with identity:
