%N A191399 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of dispersed Dyck paths of semilength n having k peak plateaux.
%C A191399 A dispersed Dyck paths of semilength n is a Motzkin path of length n with no (1,0)-steps at positive heights. A peak plateau is a run of consecutive peaks that is preceded by an upstep and followed by a down step; a peak consists of an upstep followed by a downstep.
%C A191399 Row n has 1+floor(n/4) entries.
%C A191399 Sum of entries in row n is binomial(n, floor(n/2)) = A001405(n).
%C A191399 T(n,0) = A000045(n+1) (Fibonacci numbers).
%C A191399 Sum_{k>=0} k*T(n,k) = A191319(n-2).
%F A191399 G.f.: G=G(t,z) satisfies (t*z^4-z^4-2*z^3+z^2+2*z-1)*G*(1+z*G)+1-z^2=0.
%e A191399 T(8,2)=1 because we have (UUDD)(UUDD), where U=(1,1) and D=(1,-1) (the peak plateaux are shown between parentheses).
