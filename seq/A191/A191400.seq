%N A191400 Number of nonroot vertices of degree 2 in the rooted tree having Matula-Goebel number n.
%C A191400 The Matula-Goebel number of a rooted tree can be defined in the following recursive manner: to the one-vertex tree there corresponds the number 1; to a tree T with root degree 1 there corresponds the t-th prime number, where t is the Matula-Goebel number of the tree obtained from T by deleting the edge emanating from the root; to a tree T with root degree m>=2 there corresponds the product of the Matula-Goebel numbers of the m branches of T.

%F A191400 Let g(n)=G(n,x) be the generating polynomial of the nonroot nodes of degree 2 of the rooted tree having Matula-Goebel number n, with respect to level. Then g(1)=g(2)=0; if n = p(t) (=the t-th prime) and t is prime, then g(n)=x+x*g(t); if n=p(t) (=the t-th prime) and t is not prime, then g(n)=x*g(t); if n=rs (r,s>=2), then g(n)=g(r)+g(s). Clearly, a(n)=G(n,1).
%e A191400 a(5)=2 because the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number 5 is the path tree on 4 vertices. a(7)=0 because the rooted tree with Matula-Goebel number 7 is the rooted tree Y, with no vertices of degree 2.
