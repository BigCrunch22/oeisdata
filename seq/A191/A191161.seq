%N A191161 Hypersigma(n), definition 2: sum of the divisors of n plus the recursive sum of the divisors of the proper divisors.
%C A191161 In wanting to ensure the definition was not arbitrary, I initially thought that 1s had to stop the recursion. But as T. D. Noe showed me, this doesn't have to be the case: the 1s can be included in the recursion.
