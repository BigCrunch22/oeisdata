%N A191487 The row sums of the Sierpinski-Stern triangle A191372.
%C A191487 The row sums a(n) of the Sierpinski-Stern triangle A191372 equal this sequence.
%C A191487 The differences diff1(n) = a(2*n+3) - a(2*n+1) and diff2(n) = (a(2*n+2) - a(2*n))/3, give rise to patterns that lead to Gould’s sequence A001316, see the examples.
%C A191487 The diff1(n) sequence as a triangle leads to Gould’s sequence in a peculiar way, see A191488. The leading terms of the diff1(n) rows are given by A001550(p+1), p>=1; for p=0 the leading term is 7. The rows sums of diff1(n) as a triangle equal A025192(p+2), p>=1; for p = 0 the row sum is 7. The row sums of diff1(n) as a triangle minus the first term equal 2*A053152(p+1).
%C A191487 The diff2(n) sequence as a triangle leads to Gould’s sequence A001316 in a simple way; just delete the first term and reverse the order of the rest of the terms; more terms require a higher row number. The leading terms of the diff2(n) rows are given by A085281(p), p>=0. The row sums of diff2(n) as a triangle equal A025192(p) and the row sums minus the first term equal A001047(p-1), p>=1; for p=0 the row sum minus the first term is 0.
%F A191487 a(2*n) = 3*a(n)
%F A191487 diff(n) = a(n+1) - a(n), diff1(n) = a(2*n+3) - a(2*n+1), diff2(n) = (a(2*n+2) - a(2*n))/3
%F A191487 a(2^n+1) - a(2^n) = A085281(n+1) = A007689(n) for n>=0
%F A191487 a(2^(n+1)+1) - a(2^(n+1)-1) = A001550(n+1) for n>=1.
