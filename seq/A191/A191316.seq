%N A191316 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of dispersed Dyck paths of length n having k UDU's, where U = (1,1) and D = (1,-1).
%C A191316 A dispersed Dyck paths of length n is a Motzkin path of length n with no (1,0) steps at positive heights.
%C A191316 Row n>=2 has floor(n/2) entries (n>=2).
%C A191316 Sum of entries in row n is binomial(n, floor(n/2)) = A001405(n).
%C A191316 Sum_{k>=0} k*T(n,k) = A107373(n-1).
%C A191316 Addendum Jun 18 2011: (Start)
%C A191316 T(n,k) is also the number of length n left factors of Dyck paths having k DUD's.
%C A191316 T(n,k) is also the number of dispersed Dyck paths of length n having k DUD's. Example: T(7,2)=2 because we have  HU(DU[D)UD] and U(DU[D)UD]H, where H = (1,0) (the DUD's are shown between parentheses). (End)
%F A191316 G.f.: G=G(t,z) is given by z*(1-2*z+z^2-z^3-t*z^2+t*z^3)*G^2 +(1-2*z)*(1+z^2-t*z^2)*G -(1+z^2-t*z^2)=0.
%F A191316 This can also be written as G = C/(1-z*C), where C=C(t,z) is given by z^2*C^2 - (1 + z^2 - t*z^2)*C + 1 + z^2 - t*z^2 = 0. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Jun 18 2011
%F A191316 T(n,0) = A191317(n).
%e A191316 T(7,2)=2 because we have H(UD[U)DU]D and (UD[U)DU]DH, where U=(1,1), D=(1,-1), H=(1,0) (the UDU's are shown between parentheses).
%e A191316 T(7,2)=2 because we have U(DU[D)UD]U and UU(DU[D)UD], where U=(1,1) and D=(1,-1) (the DUD's are shown between parentheses).
