%N A191345 Numbers n with property that n and 2n are sums of two distinct positive cubes.
%C A191345 Both n and 2n may be represented as a sum of two distinct positive cubes in at least one way, e.g., 19656=18^3+24^3, 2*19656=39312=2^3+34^3=15^3+33^3.
%C A191345 Which means, both n and 2n are terms in A024670 (numbers that are sums of 2 distinct positive cubes). E.g., n=728=A024670(27) and 2n=1456=A024670(48).
%C A191345 6742008 is the first n such that n and 2*n are both taxi-cab numbers (A001235). The next one is 53936064. In this sequence, there are infinitely many members such that n and 2*n are both taxi-cab numbers. - _Altug Alkan_, May 10 2016
