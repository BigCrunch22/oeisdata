%N A191598 a(1)=1. Then, if the first n terms contain all the numbers 1 to n,  a(n+1)=2*a(n), otherwise a(n+1) is the smallest number not already in the sequence.
%e A191598 There are no gaps with just one term, so we double to get a(2)=2. Still no gaps, so we double again to get a(3)=4. Now 3 has not appeared yet, so a(4)=3. The sequence is compact again, so we double to get a(5)=6.
