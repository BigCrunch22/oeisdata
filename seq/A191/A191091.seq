%N A191091 Least number of squares required when writing n as a sum of squares with the smallest square as large as possible.
%C A191091 The smallest value in the sum is A191090. All sums have at most 6 terms for n <= 1000. Is this the largest possible value? For n up to 1000, only 39, 55, 143, 543, and 564 need 6 terms.
