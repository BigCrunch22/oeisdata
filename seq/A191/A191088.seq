%N A191088 Least number k such that the first n primes have Kronecker symbol (p|k) = -1.
%C A191088 This implies, but is not equivalent to, that the first n primes are quadratic non-residues mod k. [Corrected by _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 18 2016]
%C A191088 The first 13 terms are prime. Sequence A191089 is similar, but forces k to be prime.
%C A191088 In case k is restricted to be a prime, the condition (p|k) = -1 becomes equivalent to saying that p is a quadratic non-residue (mod k). - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 18 2016
%e A191088 a(1) = 3 is the least number k such that prime(1) = 2 is not a square mod k (since for k=1 and k=2, p=2 would be zero, thus a square, mod k).
%e A191088 a(2) = 4 is the least number k such that prime(1) = 2 and prime(2) = 3 are not squares mod k (the only squares mod 4 are 0 = 0^1 = 2^2 and 1 = 1^2 = 3^3 (mod 4); while for k=2, p=2 would be zero, thus a square, and for k=3 this would be the case for p=3).
