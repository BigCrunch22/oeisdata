%N A191616 a(1) = 1; a(n) is the largest number m such that m-A085392(m) = a(n-1).
%C A191616 Lexicographically largest sequence such that a(n) - a(n-1) is the largest noncomposite divisor <a(n) of a(n).
%C A191616 Sequence is finite with 10 terms.
%C A191616 (The reason is that m-A085392(m) =  0, 1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 6, 6, 6, 5, 10, 9, 12, 7,.. starts to grow with a lower bound of m/2, and a(10)=32 is not in its list of values.)
