%N A191269 Fixed point of the morphism 0 -> 001, 1 -> 02, 2 -> 01.
%C A191269 See A191250.
%C A191269 Proof of Kimberling's conjecture on the positions of 0 in this sequence: consider the letter to letter projection pi given by pi(0) = 0, pi(1) = 1, pi(2) = 1. Then pi sigma = tau pi, where tau is the morphism on {0,1} given by tau(0) = 001, tau(1) = 01. It follows that pi(a) = x, where x = A188432 is the fixed point of tau. Note that the positions of zero in a = A191269 are equal to the positions of zero in x. Since x is the infinite Fibonacci word with a zero in front, it follows that these positions are given by A026351. - _Michel Dekking_, Aug 24 2019
