%N A191611 Places n where A085392(n+1)-A085392(n) = 1.
%C A191611 Likely the union of the Mersenne primes A000668 and the {8}. [Presence of Mersenne primes M is obvious because A085392(M+1)=2 and A085392(M)=1.
%C A191611 Absence of other primes p is also clear because A085392(p)=1 and A085392(p+1) >=3 because it contains at least one odd prime factor if not of the Mersenne type.
%C A191611 For composite candidates c, we search adjacent c+1 and c with largest noncomposite divisors 2 and 1 or 3 and 2. The first branch enforces c=2 which is immediately discarded. The second branch searches for a power of 3 adjacent to a power of 2, and the solution to this exponential diophantine equation 3^x-2^y=1 is believed to lead only to the 8 (see the Weger review in the link).]

%e A191611 Number 8 is in sequence because the difference between A085392(9)=3 and A085392(8)=2 is 1.
%e A191611 31 is in sequence because the difference between A085392(32)=2 and A085392(31)=1 is 1.
