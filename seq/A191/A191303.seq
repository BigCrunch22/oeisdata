%N A191303 An infinite sequence of 4-digit half-palindromes.
%C A191303 For the definition of k-digit half-palindromes, see A191279. Although there exist infinitely many polynomials taking only 3-digit half-palindrome values (see comment to A191279), only two polynomials are known with all values 4-digit half-palindromes. They are the polynomials P(n) which were discovered in SeqFan Discussion list from Mar 14 2011 and its double.
%C A191303 The sequence lists values of P(n). All these are odd. For a given k>=5, up to now it is unknown if there are polynomials taking only k-digit half-palindrome values and it is unknown whether there exist infinitely many such numbers.
%C A191303 Conjecture. For every k>=2, there exists a polynomial of degree k taking only k-digit half-palindrome values.
