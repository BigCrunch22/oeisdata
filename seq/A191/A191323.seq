%N A191323 Increasing sequence generated by these rules: a(1)=1, and if x is in a then [3x/2]+1 and 3x+1 are in a, where [ ]=floor.
%C A191323 This sequence represents a class of sequences generated by rules of the form "a(1)=1, and if x is in a then floor(hx+i) and floor(jx+k) are in a, where h and j are rational numbers and i and k are positive integers."  In the following examples, the floor function is denoted by [ ].
%C A191323 A191323:  [3x/2]+1, 3x+1
