%N A191106 Increasing sequence generated by these rules: a(1)=1, and if x is in a then 3x-2 and 3x are in a.

%C A191106 For a=A191106, we have closure properties: the integers in (2+a)/3 comprise a; the integers in a/3 comprise a.
%C A191106 For k >= 1, m = a(i), 1 <= i <= 2^k seems to be m such that m/(3^k+1) is in the Cantor set (except that m = 0 and m = 3^k+1 do not appear). For k >= 2,  m = (a(i)-1)/2, 1 <= i <= 2^k seems to be m such that m/((3^k-1)/2) is in the Cantor set. - _Peter Munn_, Jul 06 2019
%C A191106 Every even number is the sum of two (possibly equal) terms. More specifically: terms a(1) through a(2^n) = 3^n sum to even numbers 2 times 1 through 3^n. Every even number is infinitely often the difference of two terms. Since the sequence is equal to 2*A005836(n) + 1, these properties follow immediately from similar properties of A005836 for every number. - _Aad Thoen_, Feb 17 2022
%C A191106 if A_n=(a(1),a(2),...,a(2^n)), then A_(n+1)=(A_n,A_n+2*3^n), similar to A003278. - _Arie Bos_, Jul 26 2022
