%N A191533 Magic constants of pandiagonal magic squares of order 4 composed of distinct primes.
%C A191533 A pandiagonal square of order 4 consists of 8 pairs of complementary numbers with the sum in each pair equal to S/2 (where S is the magic constant). For example, the array {7, 113, 11, 109, 13, 107, 17, 103, 19, 101, 23, 97, 31, 89, 37, 83, 41, 79, 47, 73, 53, 67, 59, 61} consists of 12 complementary prime pairs with the sum 7 + 113 = 11 + 109 = ... = 59 + 61 = 120 = S/2.
%C A191533 Pandiagonal squares of order 4 are also the most-perfect squares.
%C A191533 There is a one-to-one correspondence between pandiagonal and associative magic squares of order 4. Any pandiagonal square can be turned into an associative square by rearrangements of its rows and columns, and vice versa.
%C A191533 For example, pandiagonal square:
%C A191533       [ 13  83  31 113
%C A191533         97  47  79  17
%C A191533         89   7 107  37
%C A191533         41 103  23  73 ]
%C A191533     the corresponding associative square:
%C A191533       [ 13  83 113  31
%C A191533         97  47  17  79
%C A191533         41 103  73  23
%C A191533         89   7  37 107]
%C A191533 Magic constants of pandiagonal magic squares of order 4 are always multiples of 4. It looks as though most sufficiently large multiples of 4 are magic constants of some pandiagonal magic squares of order 4. For multiples of 4 between 3000 and 10000, only 3028, 3208, 3436, 3664, 4436, 4504, and 5116 are not the magic constant of any pandiagonal magic squares of order 4. - _Zhao Hui Du_, Jan 09 2024
