%N A359296 Absolute discriminants of imaginary quadratic fields with elementary bicyclic 7-class group and capitulation type the identity permutation.
%C A359296 An algebraic number field with this capitulation type has a 7-class field tower of precise length 2 with Galois group isomorphic to the Schur sigma-group SmallGroup(16807,7). It is a solution to the problem posed by Olga Taussky-Todd in 1970.
