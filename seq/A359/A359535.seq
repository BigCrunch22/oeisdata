%N A359535 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers such that a(a(n)) and a(a(n+1)) share a common factor when n >= 2.
%C A359535 The common factor rule does not apply at n=1 so the sequence starts with a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 2.

%e A359535 a(3) cannot be 3 since then a(a(2))=2 and a(a(3))=3 would have no common factor, but a(3) = 4 is allowed (and puts a constraint on the subsequent a(4) value).
%e A359535 a(6) is 8 because so far we have (1,2,4,6,3). We see that the 6th term must share a factor with the 4th and 3rd terms, which are 6 and 4, respectively. The smallest number not already used that satisfies this property is 8.
