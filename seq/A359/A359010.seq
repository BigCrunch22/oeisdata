%N A359010 Variant of the inventory sequence: Record the number of terms whose value occurs once thus far in the sequence, then the number of terms whose value occurs twice thus far, and so on; a row ends when a 0 that would repeat infinitely is reached.
%C A359010 Note that we are counting terms with repetition. For example, to find a(5)=4, we are looking for the number of terms that appear twice. 0 and 1 each occur twice, which is 2+2=4 (not 1+1=2). This means that each column contains only multiples of the number of occurences it is counting.
