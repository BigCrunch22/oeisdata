%N A359526 Number of unbiased (balanced) free polyiamonds with 2n cells.
%C A359526 Define the bias of a polyiamond to be the difference between the number of black triangles and the number of white triangles when chessboard coloring is applied to the polyiamond. Unbiased polyiamonds are those having an equal number of black and white triangles. The sequence is defined for 2n rather than n as odd-sized polyiamonds are obviously biased.
