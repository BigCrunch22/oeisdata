%N A359972 Number of 4-shaft weaving patterns, threaded 1,2,3,4, with n rows, up to symmetries.
%C A359972 This is the number of n X 4 arrays with entries in {0,1} such that
%C A359972 (a) every row and every column contains at least one 0
%C A359972 (b) every row and every column contains at least one 1
%C A359972 where two arrays that can be transformed into each other by
%C A359972 any composition of the four operations below are considered equivalent.
%C A359972 (1) rotate all the rows by some fixed amount
%C A359972 (2) rotate all the columns by some fixed amount
%C A359972 (3) reverse the order of all rows
%C A359972 (4) reverse the order of all columns.
%C A359972 The motivation is that two arrays A and B are considered equivalent if tiling the plane with translated copies of A (resp., B) results in essentially the same pattern.
%e A359972 For n = 2 the 3 patterns are [[0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,0]], [[0,0,1,1],[1,1,0,0]], and [[0,1,0,1],[1,0,1,0]].
