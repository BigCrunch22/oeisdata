%N A359816 Parity of A359815, where A359815 is the Dirichlet inverse of A359770, which is the characteristic function for numbers k such that k and bigomega(k) are of different parity.
%C A359816 Note that here a(n) = 1 does not imply that A359770(n) = 1 also. The difference A359770(n) - a(n) can be -1, 0, or +1. This in contrast to sequences like A359764, A359774 and A359781.
