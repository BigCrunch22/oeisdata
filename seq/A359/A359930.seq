%N A359930 The number of practical numbers strictly between A005153(n) and A005153(n)^(1+1/n).
%C A359930 This sequence is based on Sun's conjecture that A005153(n)^(1/n) is a strictly decreasing sequence for n >= 3. This conjecture states for practical numbers what Firoozbakht's conjecture says for prime numbers, and implies that a(n) > 0 for n >= 3. It is valid at least for n <= 9991. The corresponding sequence for primes is A182134.

%e A359930 The tenth practical number, A005153(10), is 24. 24^(1+1/10) is approximately 32.98. There are 3 practical numbers between 24 and 32.98, namely 28, 30, and 32. Thus a(10) = 3.
