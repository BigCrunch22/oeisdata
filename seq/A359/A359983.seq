%N A359983 Numbers with exactly two nonzero decimal digits and not ending with 0.
%C A359983 Bugeaud proves that the largest prime factor in a(n) increases without bound; in particular, for any e > 0 and all large n, the largest prime factor in a(n) is (1-e) * log log a(n) * log log log a(n) / log log log log a(n). So the largest prime factor in a(n) is more than k log n log log n/log log log n for any k < 1/3 and large enough n.
%C A359983 It appears that a(49) = 64 is the largest power of 2 in the sequence, a(78) = 96 is the largest 3-smooth number in this sequence, a(113) = 405 is the largest 5-smooth number in this sequence, a(170) = 1008 is the largest 7- and 11-smooth number in this sequence, a(243) = 9009 is the largest 13-smooth number in this sequence, a(259) = 20007 is the largest 19-smooth number in this sequence, etc.
