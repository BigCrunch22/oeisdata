%N A359546 a(n) = 1 if there is no factor of the form p^p in n, but for some k-th arithmetic derivative (k >= 1) of n such a factor exists; otherwise 0.
%C A359546 Question: What can be said about the distribution of 0's and 1's in this sequence? Compare also to A328308, A341996 and A359543.

%F A359546 a(n) = [A256750(n) < 0], where [ ] is the Iverson bracket.
%e A359546 a(15) = 1, because although 15 itself is not in A100716, its arithmetic derivative 15' = 8 is there.
%e A359546 a(26) = 1, as although neither 26 nor 26' = 15 are in A100716, the second derivative of 26, 26'' = 15' = 8 is there.
