%N A359028 Integers m such that A006218(m+1)/(m+1) > A006218(m)/m.
%C A359028 Equivalently: Indices m such that f(m + 1) > f(m) where f(m) = Sum_{k=1..m} d(k) / m, where d(k) is the number of divisors of k (A000005).
%C A359028 This sequence comes from a problem proposed by South Africa during the 47th International Mathematical Olympiad, in 2006 at Ljubljana, Slovenia, but not used for the competition (see link).
%C A359028 In fact, the problem asked for a proof that, for the sequence {f(m)} defined by f(m) = (1/m) * ([m/1] + [m/2] + ... + [m/m]), where [x] denotes the integer part of x,
%C A359028 (a) f(m + 1) > f(m) occurs infinitely often (these are the terms m of this sequence),
%C A359028 (b) f(m + 1) < f(m) occurs infinitely often (see A359029).
%C A359028 Differs from A047255 when a(24) = 34 while A047255(24) = 35.
%C A359028 Some results:
%C A359028 1. For every m, f(m) = (1/m) * ([m/1] + [m/2] + ... + [m/m]) proposed in the problem is the arithmetic mean of d(1), d(2), ..., d(m) = A006218(m)/m.
%C A359028 2. f(m + 1) > f(m) is equivalent to d(m + 1) > f(m).
%C A359028 3. Each m = c - 1, where c is a highly composite number (A002182) is a term.
%C A359028 Proof: in this case, d(m+1) = d(c) > max{d(1), ..., d(m)}; as f(m) = (d(1)+...+d(m)) / m < m*d(c)/m = d(c), it follows that d(m+1) = d(c) > f(m).
%C A359028 4. As there are infinitely many highly composite numbers, that also proves that f(m + 1) > f(m) occurs infinitely often, answer to IMO problem (a).
%C A359028 5. There exist other terms not of the form A002182 - 1: 2, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, ...
%C A359028 Note that f(m) = f(m+1) is possible iff f(m) = tau(m+1), so f(m) must be an integer (A050226) but this is not sufficient. The only known term such that f(m) = f(m+1) is at m=4, with f(4) = 2 and f(5) = tau(5) = 2.

%e A359028 f(7) = (d(1)+d(2)+d(3)+d(4)+d(5)+d(6)+d(7)) / 7 = (1+2+2+3+2+4+2) / 7 = 16/7 < f(6) = (d(1)+d(2)+d(3)+d(4)+d(5)+d(6)) / 6 = (1+2+2+3+2+4) / 6 = 14/6 = 7/3, so 6 is a term.
