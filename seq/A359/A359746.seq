%N A359746 Numbers k such that k, k+1 and k+2 have the same ordered prime signature.
%C A359746 First differs from its subsequence A039833 at n = 17, and from its subsequence A075039 at n = 53.
%C A359746 The ordered prime signature of a number n is the list of exponents of the distinct prime factors in the prime factorization of n, in the order of the prime factors (A124010).
%C A359746 Can 4 consecutive integers have the same ordered prime signature? There are no such quadruples below 10^9.
%C A359746 The answer to the question above is no. Two out of every four consecutive numbers are even and their powers of 2 are different. - _Ivan N. Ianakiev_, Jan 13 2023

%e A359746 33 is a term since 33 = 3^1 * 11^1, 34 = 2^1 * 17^1, and 35 = 5^1 * 7^1 have the same ordered prime signature, (1, 1).
%e A359746 4923 is a term since 4923 = 3^2 * 547^1, 4924 = 2^2 * 1231^1, and 4925 = 5^2 * 197^1 have the same ordered prime signature, (2, 1).
%e A359746 603 is a term of A052214 but not a term of this sequence, since 603 = 3^2 * 67^1, 604 = 2^2 * 151^1, and 605 = 5^1 * 11^2 have different ordered prime signatures, (2, 1) or (1, 2).
