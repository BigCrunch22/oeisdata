%N A359409 Integers d such that the largest possible arithmetic progression (AP) of primes with common difference d has exactly four elements.
%C A359409 These 4 elements are not necessarily consecutive primes.
%C A359409 A342309(d) gives the first element of the smallest AP with 4 elements whose common difference is a(n) = d.
%C A359409 All the terms are multiples of 6 (A008588) but are not multiples of 5 and also must not belong to A206039; indeed, terms d' in A206039 correspond to the largest possible arithmetic progression (AP) of primes that have exactly five elements with this common difference d'.

%F A359409 m is a term iff A123556(m) = 4.
%e A359409 d = 18 is a term because the largest possible APs of primes with common difference d = 18 have all 4 elements; the first such APs start with 5, 43, 53, ... The smallest one is (5, 23, 41, 59) then 77 is composite.
%e A359409 d = 24 is another term because the largest possible APs of primes with common difference d = 24 have all 4 elements; the first such APs start with 59, 79, 349, ... The smallest one is (59, 83, 107, 131) then 155 is composite.
