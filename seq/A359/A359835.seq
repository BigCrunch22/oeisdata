%N A359835 a(n) = 0 if A353418(n) = 0, otherwise 1. Here A353418 is Dirichlet inverse of the characteristic function for numbers k at which points A156552(k) is a multiple of 3.
%C A359835 In contrast to A359836, which seems to satisfy A359836(n) <= A353269(n), here a(n) - A353269(n) may obtain any of the values -1, 0 or +1.
