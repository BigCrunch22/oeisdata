%N A359402 Numbers whose binary expansion and reversed binary expansion have the same sum of positions of 1's, where positions in a sequence are read starting with 1 from the left.
%C A359402 Also numbers whose binary expansion and reversed binary expansion have the same sum of partial sums.
%C A359402 Also numbers whose average position of a 1 in their binary expansion is (c+1)/2, where c is the number of digits.
%C A359402 Conjecture: Also numbers whose binary expansion has as least squares fit a line of zero slope, counted by A222955.
%F A359402 A230877(a(n)) = A029931(a(n)).
%e A359402 The binary expansion of 70 is (1,0,0,0,1,1,0), with positions of 1's {1,5,6}, while the reverse positions are {2,3,7}. Both sum to 12, so 70 is in the sequence.
