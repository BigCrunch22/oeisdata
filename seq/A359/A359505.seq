%N A359505 a(1)=2, a(2)=3, and for n >= 3, a(n) is calculated by considering in ascending order all products P of (distinct) terms from {a(1..n-1)} until finding one where P-1 has a prime factor not in {a(1..n-1)}, in which case a(n) is the smallest such prime factor.
%C A359505 A new prime is always found since at worst P can be the product of all primes {a(1..n-1)} and then P-1 certainly has a prime factor not among a(1..n-1).
%C A359505 Taking products P in ascending order generally results in smaller quantities to consider than always taking the product of all primes as done in A084598.
%C A359505 Conjecture: P-1 has at most one prime factor not already in the sequence, so the requirement of taking "the smallest such" is unnecessary (verified up to n=10000).

%e A359505 For n=3, the primes so far are 2 and 3 but products P=2 or P=3 have P-1 = 1 or 2 which have no new prime factor. Product P = 2*3 = 6 has P-1 = 5 which is a new prime so a(3) = 5.
%e A359505 For n=4, the smallest product P with a new prime in P-1 is P = 3*5 = 15 for which P-1 = 14 and a(4) = 7 is its smallest new prime factor.
