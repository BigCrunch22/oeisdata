%N A359773 Dirichlet inverse of A356163, where A356163 is the characteristic function of the numbers with an even sum of prime factors (counted with multiplicity).
%C A359773 a(225) = 2 is the first term with absolute value larger than 1.
%C A359773 As A356163 is not multiplicative, neither is this sequence.
%C A359773 For all numbers n with an odd number of odd prime factors (with mult.), a(n) = 0. Proof: Numbers with an odd number of odd prime factors is sequence A335657 (equal to numbers whose odd part is in A067019). In the convolution formula, when n is any term of A335657, either the divisor (n/d) or d (but not both) is also a term of A335657. As A356163 is zero for all A335657, it is easy to show by induction that also a(n) is zero for all such numbers.
%C A359773 Therefore, nonzero values (including any odd values, see A359775) occur only on a subset of A036349, and A359774(n) <= A356163(n).
