%N A359336 Irregular triangle read by rows: the n-th row lists the values 0..2^n-1 representing all subsets of a set of n elements. When its elements are linearly ordered, the subsets are sorted first by their size and then lexicographically.
%C A359336 The n-th row of the table is denoted by row(n) and contains a permutation of the integers from the interval [0, 2^n-1] which defines an ordering of all binary vectors of length n. Let the elements of the set B_n = {b_n, b_(n-1), ..., b_2, b_1} be linearly ordered: b_n < b_(n-1) < ... < b_2 < b_1. When we consider the binary vectors defined by row(n) as characteristic vectors, they define all subsets of B_n, sorted first by their cardinalities and then lexicographically. The sequence in row(n) is partitioned into n+1 subsequences of integers whose binary vectors have the same (Hamming) weight.
%C A359336 Equivalently, the sequence in row(n) defines all (n,k) combinations over a linearly ordered set in lexicographic order, for k = 0, 1, ..., n.
%C A359336 Like A294648 and A351939, A359336 represents one of the numerous weight orderings of the vectors of the n-dimensional Boolean cube (or the subsets of a set of n-elements sorted by their size) - see A051459.
%C A359336 Following the formula for row(n), we get:
%C A359336 T(n,0) = 0;
%C A359336 T(n, 2^n-1) = 2^n-1;
%C A359336 T(n,n) = 1, for n >= 1.
%C A359336 T(n,k) = 2^(n-k) for 1 <= k <= n.
%C A359336 Thus the regular triangle T(n,k), for n = 1, 2, 3, ... and for 1 <= k <= n consists of powers of 2 (A000079): in ascending order by columns and in descending order by rows.

%F A359336 For n = 1, 2, 3, ..., row(n) is a concatenation of the subsequences r(n, 0), r(n, 1), ..., r(n, n) defined by the recurrence:
%F A359336 r(n, 0) = (0),
%F A359336 r(n, n) = (2^n - 1),
%F A359336 r(n, k) = (r(n-1, k-1) + 2^(n-1)) concatenate r(n-1, k), for 0 < k < n.
%F A359336 In the above, r(n-1, k-1) + 2^(n-1) means the 2^(n-1) is added to each member of the subsequence r(n-1, k-1).
%e A359336 In the following table, the members of row(3) are given in column dec., the corresponding characteristic vectors are in column bin., and the corresponding subsets of B_3 are listed under B_3.
