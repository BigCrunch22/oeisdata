%N A359333 a(1) = 0, and for any n > 1, a(n) is chosen among 0 and 1 so as to minimize the length of the longest sequence of distinct integers in arithmetic progression in the interval 1..n and containing n where the sequence is constant; in case of a tie, maximize the least common difference in those longest arithmetic progressions.
%C A359333 This sequence has connections with A038219; in both sequences we try to avoid certain patterns when computing successive terms.

%e A359333 For n = 1:
%e A359333 - a(1) = 0 by definition.
%e A359333 For n = 2:
%e A359333 - the value 0 would imply an arithmetic progression of length 2,
%e A359333 - the value 1 would imply an arithmetic progression of length 1,
%e A359333 - so a(2) = 1.
%e A359333 For n = 3:
%e A359333 - the value 0 would imply an arithmetic progression of length 2 and common difference 2,
%e A359333 - the value 1 would imply an arithmetic progression of length 2 and common difference 1,
%e A359333 - so a(3) = 0.
