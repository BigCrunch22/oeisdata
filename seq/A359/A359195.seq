%N A359195 Positive integers k with a smaller fraction of powers (mod k) than any smaller positive integers.
%C A359195 It seems that a(n) <= 2*a(n-1) for n > 3.
%C A359195 Conjecture: terms are products of primorials (A025487). A proof would greatly speed the search for more terms. On this conjecture, the next terms are 352800, 529200, 1058400, 2116800, 4233600, 6350400, 10584000, 19051200, 21168000, 31752000, 63504000, ....
%e A359195 2 is not a square or a cube mod 4, while 0, 1, and 3 are all cubes mod 4. 1/4 is a record, so 4 is in the sequence.
%e A359195 None of 2, 4, 6, 10, 12, 14 are cubes mod 16 and of those only 4 is a square and none are 5th powers, for a 5/16 fraction, which is a record, so 16 is in the sequence.
%Y A359195 A085635 is the analogous sequence for squares.
%Y A359195 Cf. A025487, A337868.
