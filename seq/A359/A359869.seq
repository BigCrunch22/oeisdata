%N A359869 Numbers whose product of distinct prime factors is less than the sum of its prime factors (with repetition).
%C A359869 Numbers n where A007947(n) < A001414(n).
%e A359869 12 = 2^2*3 is a term since its product of distinct prime factors 2 * 3 = 6 is less than its sum of prime factors with multiplicity 2 + 2 + 3 = 7.
%e A359869 45 = 3^2*5 is not a term since its product of distinct prime factors 3 * 5 = 15 is greater than its sum of prime factors with multiplicity 3 + 3 + 5 = 11.
%e A359869 All prime numbers fail as terms since the product of distinct prime factors is equal to sum of prime factors.
