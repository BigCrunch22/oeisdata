%N A359686 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the minimum number of connected endofunctions that are spanning subgraphs of a semi-regular loopless digraph on n vertices each with out-degree k.
%C A359686 An endofunction represented as a digraph is one in which every vertex has out-degree 1. Loopless means that there are no fixed points in the function. The digraph of a connected endofunction is unicyclic (contains exactly one cycle).
%C A359686 In the case k = 1, the graphs considered have vertices with out-degree 1 and the entire graph is the only spanning subgraph that is an endofunction. Hence T(n,1) = 0. (n > 3 because when n = 2, 3 it still will be unicyclic.)
%C A359686 In the case k = n-1, the graphs considered are the complete digraphs and every connected endofunction on the vertex set is a subgraph. Hence T(n, n-1) = A000435(n), which gives the total number of connected endofunctions without fixed points.
%F A359686 T(n,1) = 0 for n > 3, otherwise 1.
%F A359686 T(n,n-1) = A000435(n).
%F A359686 T(n,k) = 0 for 2*k + 2 < n.
