%N A359753 a(n) is the number of subsets of the divisors of k which sum to k+1 where k is a number all of whose prime divisors are consecutive primes starting at 2.
%C A359753 This sequence might be used to split the positive integers into families of numbers that may or may not be a candidate for A359197(n).
%F A359753 a(n) = A359196(A055932(n)).
%e A359753 a(6) = 3 as A055932(6) = 12 and there are 12 subsets of the divisors of 12 which sum to 12+1 = 13 namely {1, 2, 4, 6}, {1, 12} and {3, 4, 6}.
