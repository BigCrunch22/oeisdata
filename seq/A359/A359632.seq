%N A359632 Sequence of gaps between deletions of multiples of 7 in step 4 of the sieve of Eratosthenes.
%C A359632 This sequence is a repeating cycle 12, 7, 4, 7, 4, 7, 12, 3 of length A005867(4) = 8 = (prime(1)-1)*(prime(2)-1)*(prime(3)-1).
%C A359632 The mean of the cycle is prime(4) = 7.
%C A359632 The cycle is constructed from the sieve of Eratosthenes as follows.
%C A359632 In the first 2 steps of the sieve, the gaps between the deleted numbers are constant: gaps of 2 in step 1 when we delete multiples of 2, and gaps of 3 in step 2 when we delete multiples of 3.
%C A359632 In step 3, when we delete all multiples of 5, the gaps are alternately 7 and 3 (i.e., cycle [7,3]).
%C A359632 For this sequence, we look at the interesting cycle from step 4 (multiples of 7).
%C A359632 Excluding the final 3, the cycle has reflective symmetry: 12, 7, 4, 7, 4, 7, 12. This is true for every subsequent step of the sieve too.
%C A359632 The central element is 7 (BUT not all steps have their active prime number as the central element).
%C A359632 a(1) is A054272(4).
%C A359632 a(8) = 3, the first appearance of the last element of the cycle, corresponds to deletion of 217 = A002110(4)+7.

%e A359632 The first two multiples of 7 are 7 itself and 49 and they are distance 12 apart in the list so that a(1) = 12.
%e A359632 For n = 2, a(n) = 7, because the third multiple of 7 that is not a multiple of 2, 3 or 5 is 77 = 7 * 11, which is located 7 numbers after 49 = 7*7 in the list of numbers without the multiples of 2, 3 and 5.
