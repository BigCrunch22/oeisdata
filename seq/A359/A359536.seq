%N A359536 a(n) is the size of the largest subset of {0,1,...,n} such that the sum of two (not necessarily distinct) elements is never a power of 2.
%C A359536 a(n) is the independence number of the graph with vertices all members of {0,1,...,n} that are not powers of 2, and edges (i,j) when i+j is a power of 2.
%C A359536 The greedy algorithm for constructing a set A with these properties (starting with 0 and then adding an integer to A iff it is not a power of 2 and does not sum to a power of 2 with a smaller integer already in A, i.e., {0,3,6,7,11,12,14,...}) is maximal in that |A intersect [0,n]| = a(n). It follows that t is in A iff a(t-1) < a(t). There are no 4 consecutive integers in A and no 4 consecutive integers not in A. - _Sarosh Adenwalla_, Feb 16 2023

%F A359536 From _Sarosh Adenwalla_, Feb 16 2023: (Start)
%F A359536 (n + 1 - floor(log_2(n)))/2 <= a(n) <= A110654(n) for n >= 1. The upper bound is achieved iff n > 0 can be written as the difference of two powers of 2 and the lower bound is achieved iff n = floor(2^s/3) for s >= 2.
%F A359536 Letting r = 2^(floor(log_2(n))+1) - n then a(n) = (n-r)/2 + a(r-1). a(n) can be calculated by repeatedly applying this at most floor(log_2(n)) times.
%F A359536 For every integer c >= -1, there are infinitely many n such that a(n) = (n-c)/2.
%F A359536 For 0 <= c < 2^(k-1), a(2^k+c) = 2^(k-1) - 1 + a(c) and for 0 < c <= 2^(k-1), a(2^k-c) = 2^(k-1) - c + a(c-1). (End)
