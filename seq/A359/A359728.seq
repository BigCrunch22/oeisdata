%N A359728 a(1) = 1; a(n) is the smallest positive number not among the first k terms where k is the number of times a(n-1) has occurred.
%C A359728 A new number is always followed by a 2.

%e A359728 a(4) is 3 because the previous term (2) appears two times; we therefore look at the first 2 terms (1,2). 3 is the smallest number not among them, so a(4) is 3.
%e A359728 a(21) is 5: We see that a(20)=4 appears 9 times; the smallest number not among the first 9 terms (1,2,2,3,2,3,3,3,4) is 5.
