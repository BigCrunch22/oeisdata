%N A359261 a(n) is the least term of A359260 whose number of divisors is n.
%C A359261 a(n) is the least number m whose number of divisors is A000005(m) = n such that the arithmetic mean of the first k divisors of m is an integer for all k in 1..n.
%C A359261 a(17) = 4084081^16 = 5.991...*10^105 is too large to include in the data section.
%C A359261 a(n) exists for all n >= 1. For n > 1, consider a prime p of the form m*lcm(1,2,...n-1) + 1, with m >= 1. Such a prime exists by Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions. Then, p^(n-1) has n divisors, and p^k == 1 (mod lcm(1..n-1)) for k = 0..(n-1). Therefore, Sum_{k=0..n-1} p^k == k (mod lcm(1,2,...n-1)), or equivalently, Sum_{k=0..n-1} p^k is divisible by k for k = 0..(n-1). Thus, p^(n-1) is in A359260.
%e A359261 a(3) = 49 since 49 is the least number with 3 divisors in A359260. Its divisors are {1, 7, 49}, 1/1 = 1, (1+7)/2 = 4, and (1+7+49)/3 = 19 are all integers.
