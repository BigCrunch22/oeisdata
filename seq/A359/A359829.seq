%N A359829 Primitive elements of A235992: numbers k with an even arithmetic derivative that cannot be represented as a product of two smaller such numbers.
%F A359829 {k | A358680(k)=1 and 0=Sum_{d|k, 1<d<k} A358680(d)*A358680(k/d)}.
%e A359829 For 12, A003415(12) = 12' = 16, an even number, but on the other hand, for its factors 2 and 6, neither has even derivative as 2' = 1, 6' = 5, while for its factors 3 and 4 only the other factor has even derivative, as 3' = 1, 4' = 4, so 12 has no nontrivial pair of factors such that both of them would have even arithmetic derivative, and therefore 12 is included in this sequence.
