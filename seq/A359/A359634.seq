%N A359634 a(0)=1 and thereafter a(n) is the length of the longest contiguous group of terms in the sequence thus far that add up to n; if no such group exists, set a(n)=0.
%C A359634 If a zero appears, it is not counted as a term in a contiguous grouping. For example, if (10, 30, 0, 60) is our longest group to sum to 100, this counts as 3 terms, not 4. However, in 50 million terms (computed by _Kevin Ryde_), a zero has not appeared. Why is this?
%C A359634 How does the lower envelope of this sequence behave?

%e A359634 a(6) is 4 because in the sequence thus far (1,1,2,2,3,3), the longest run of consecutive terms that sums to 6 is (1,1,2,2), which is 4 terms.
