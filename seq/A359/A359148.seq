%N A359148 1, together with numbers k such that A173426(k) is prime.
%C A359148 Many of the comments following the "Most Wanted Prime" video assumed that A173426(1) was 11, and so "Numbers k such that A173426(k) is prime" should begin 1, 10, 2446, ... This is incorrect, A173426(1) = 1 and is not prime.
%C A359148 However, if the 1 is omitted the sequence is too short to include in the OEIS, so the present sequence will serve as a place-holder until we find the next term.
%C A359148 Its inclusion could also be justified by the OEIS policy of including published but erroneous sequences to serve as pointers to the correct versions.
%C A359148 _Serge Batalov_ comments (see A173426) that a(4) >= 60000.
