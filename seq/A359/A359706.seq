%N A359706 Number of free (2-sided) ouroboros polyominoes with k=2n cells.
%C A359706 A "snake" polyomino is a polyomino in which exactly two cells have exactly one (Von Neumann) neighbor apiece, and the rest have two neighbors apiece. Arthur O'Dwyer coined the term "ouroboros polyomino" for a polyomino in which every cell has exactly two neighbors: that is, an ouroboros polyomino is like a "snake" in which the head cell neighbors the tail cell.
%C A359706 A324407 etc. use the term "polyomino ring" in place of "ouroboros polyomino."
%C A359706 A checkerboard coloring shows that every ouroboros must have an even number of cells.
%C A359706 This sequence counts ouroboroi which do not designate a specific head or tail cell; thus the unique 8-cell ouroboros is

%C A359706 One could imagine counting "headed" ouroboroi, in which the head and tail are distinguished. There are two distinct ways to create a free 8-cell "headed" ouroboros:

%C A359706 This sequence first differs from A359707 (the count of 1-sided ouroboroi) at k=14. The four chiral 14-cell ouroboroi, each of which is counted once by A359706 and twice by A359707, are

%Y A359706 A002013 counts free (2-sided) snake polyominoes with k=n cells. A359706 added to A002013 gives the number of free polyominoes in which each cell has at most 2 (Von Neumann) neighbors.
%Y A359706 A359707 counts free (2-sided) ouroboros polyominoes with k=2n cells. A359706 subtracted from A359707 gives the count of chiral pairs.
