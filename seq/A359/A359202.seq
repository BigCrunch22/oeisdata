%N A359202 Number of (bidimensional) faces of regular m-polytopes for m >= 3.
%C A359202 In 3 dimensions there are five (convex) regular polytopes and they have 4, 6, 8, 12, or 20 (bidimensional) faces (A053016).
%C A359202 In 4 dimensions there are six regular 4-polytopes and they have 10, 24, 32, 96, 720, or 1200 faces (A063925).
%C A359202 In m >= 5 dimensions, there are only 3 regular polytopes (i.e., the m-simplex, the m-cube, and the m-crosspolytope) so that we can sort their number of bidimensional faces in ascending order and define the present sequence.
