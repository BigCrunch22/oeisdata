%N A359663 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest positive number which has not appeared that shares a factor with the sum of the first n terms of the Champernowne string starting from 1.
%C A359663 For the Champernowne string starting from 1 see A033307. In the first 100000 terms there are 45 fixed points: 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, ..., 252, 264, 319. It is plausible no more exist. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
%H A359663 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A359663/a359663.png">Image of the first 100000 terms</a>. The green line is a(n) = n.
%e A359663 a(3) = 2 as the sum of the first 3 terms of the Champernowne string is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and 2 is the smallest unused number that shares a factor with 6.
%e A359663 a(10) = 10 as the sum of the first 10 terms of the Champernowne string is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 1 = 46, and 10 is the smallest unused number that shares a factor with 46.
