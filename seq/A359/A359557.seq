%N A359557 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number which has not appeared such that all the distinct prime factors of a(n-2) + a(n-1) are factors of a(n).
%C A359557 All terms other than 3 and 5 are even. As a(114) = 510 and a(115) = 570 both contain 2 and 5 as prime factors, all subsequent terms are multiples of 10. Likewise after 1994 terms all terms contain 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 as factors, so all subsequent terms are multiples of 2*3*5*7*11 = 2310.
%C A359557 The terms grow rapidly in size, e.g., a(2459) = 28318290. The smallest number not to appear is 7.
%C A359557 a(n) = k*m such that k = A007947(a(n-2)+a(n-1)) and m >= 1 produces the smallest k*m != a(j), j < n. - _Michael De Vlieger_, Jan 07 2023
