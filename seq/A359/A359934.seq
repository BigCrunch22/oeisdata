%N A359934 Number of edges among all distinct circles that can be constructed from an n x n square grid of points using only a compass.
%C A359934 A circle is constructed for every pair of the n x n points, the first point defines the circle's center while the second the radius distance. The number of distinct circles constructed from the n x n points is A359931(n).
%C A359934 No formula for a(n) is known.
%C A359934 See A359932 and A359933 for images of the circles.
%F A359934 a(n) = A359932(n) + A359933(n) - 1 by Euler's formula.
