%N A359831 Nonprimitive elements of A235992: numbers k such that their arithmetic derivative (A003415) is even, and also for some divisor d|k, 1<d<k, both d and k/d have even derivative.
%e A359831 16 = 4*4 is present because both 16 and 4 have even arithmetic derivative (both are in A235992).
%e A359831 160 is present as 160' = A003415(160) = 336, which is an even number, and 160 = 8*20, with 8' = 12 and 20' = 24 both even. Note that there is also another pair of divisors that make 160 nonprimitive, as 160 = 12*15, and also 12' = 16 and 15' = 8 are both even. (Same is true for 4*40).
%e A359831 189 is present as 189' = 216, and 189 = 9*21, with 9' = 6 and 21' = 10.
