%N A359662 Number of (3-dimensional) cells of regular m-polytopes for m >= 3.
%C A359662 In 3 dimensions there are five (convex) regular polytopes and each of them (trivially) consists of a single cell.
%C A359662 In 4 dimensions there are six regular 4-polytopes and they have 5, 8, 16, 24, 120, 600 3-dimensional cells (A063924).
%C A359662 In m >= 5 dimensions, there are only 3 regular polytopes (i.e., the m-simplex, the m-cube, and the m-crosspolytope) so that we can sort their number of (3-dimensional) cells in ascending order and define the present sequence.
