%N A359408 Integers d such that the longest possible arithmetic progression (AP) of primes with common difference d has only two elements.
%C A359408 As '2 is prime' and also '2 is one less than prime 3' (see A173919), there exist two subsequences with k = 2 elements in these APs of primes (see examples).
%C A359408 1. If d is an odd term, then d is in A040976 \ {0} with d = prime(m) - 2, for some m >= 2, and, for each such d, there exists only one longest possible AP of primes, and this AP is always: (2, prime(m)) = (2, d+2), so starts with 2. This subsequence corresponds to the first case: '2 is prime'.
%C A359408 2. If d is an even term, then d is in A360735 and the longest corresponding APs of primes are of the form (q, q+d) with q odd primes. This subsequence corresponds to the second case '2 is one less than prime 3'.
%C A359408 A342309(d) gives the first element of the smallest AP with 2 elements whose common difference is a(n) = d.
%C A359408 The two elements of these APs are not necessarily consecutive primes.

%F A359408 m is a term iff A123556(m) = 2.
%e A359408 d = 1 is a term because the only longest AP of primes with common difference 1 is (2, 3) that has 2 elements because 4 is composite.
%e A359408 d = 3 is a term because the only longest AP of primes with common difference 3 is (2, 5) that has 2 elements because 8 is composite.
%e A359408 d = 5 is a term because the only longest AP of primes with common difference 5 is (2, 7) that has 2 elements because 12 is composite.
%e A359408 d = 16 is a term because the first longest APs of primes with common difference 16 are (3, 19), (7,23), (13, 29), ... that all have 2 elements; the first one that starts with A342309(16) = 3 is (3, 19).
%e A359408 d = 22 is a term because the first longest APs of primes with common difference 22 are (7, 29), (19, 41), (31, 53), ... that all have 2 elements; the first one that starts with A342309(22) = 7 is (7, 29).
