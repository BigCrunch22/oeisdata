%N A359510 Numbers that can't be written as a palindromic product, i.e., such that the concatenation of all digits of the factors yields a palindrome.
%C A359510 Any number of factors 1 is allowed anywhere in the product.
%C A359510 The sequence contains all primes which are not palindromic when stripped of digits '1' on either side (for example 23, 29, 37, but not 13, 17, 19, 31 which can be written as 13*1, 17*1, 19*1, 1*31, etc., where the concatenation of all digits, "131", "171", ... is palindromic).

%e A359510 Any palindrome is trivially a palindromic product and therefore not in the sequence. Also not in the sequence are 10 = 10*1, 12 = 12*1, ..., 20 = 2*5*2, 21 = 1*21. Therefore the first term is a(1) = 23.
