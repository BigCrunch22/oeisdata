%N A359114 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest positive number which has not appeared that shares a factor with the sum of the first n bits of the binary Champernowne string starting from 1.
%C A359114 For the binary Champernowne string starting from 1 see A030302. In the first 100000 terms the fixed points are 1, 2, 12, 24, 25; it is likely no more exist. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
%H A359114 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A359114/a359114.png">Image of the first 100000 terms</a>. The green line is a(n) = n.
%e A359114 a(3) = 4 as the sum of the first 3 bits of the binary Champernowne string is 1 + 1 + 0 = 2, and 4 is the smallest unused number that shares a factor with 2.
%e A359114 a(10) = 9 as the sum of the first 10 bits of the binary Champernowne string is 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 6, and 9 is the smallest unused number that shares a factor with 6.
