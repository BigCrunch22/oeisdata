%N A359218 Let S(n) be the sequence obtained through the mapping of x->A359194(x) starting with n and stopping when 0 is reached, -1 if 0 is never reached. a(n) = m if appears in S(k), k < n, otherwise -1.
%C A359218 By convention, a(0) = 0 since n = 0.
%C A359218 Regarding A359215(n), this is the value m that had appeared in S(k), k < n.
