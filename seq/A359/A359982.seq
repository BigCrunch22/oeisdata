%N A359982 Numbers whose digits are distinct nonprimes and are not a permutation of a smaller such number.
%C A359982 The sequence consists of numbers constructed from the combination of the six nonprime digits 0,1,4,6,8,9 without duplication of the digits. Hence there are 2^6 - 1 = 63 terms.
%e A359982 10 is in the sequence as both 1 and 0 are nonprime, all digits are distinct, and no permutation of those digits yields a smaller number (with no leading 0's).
%e A359982 14 is in the sequence as both 1 and 4 are nonprime, all digits are distinct, and no permutation of those digits yields a smaller number.
%e A359982 41 is not in the sequence as 14 is a permutation of its digits and is a smaller number.
%e A359982 189 is in the sequence, so its permutations 198, 819, 891, 918 and 981, all of which are larger, are not.
%e A359982 104689 is in the sequence as all digits are nonprime and distinct, and no permutation of those digits yields a smaller number (with no leading 0's).
