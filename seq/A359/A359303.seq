%N A359303 Bitwise encoding of the state of a 1D cellular automaton after n steps from ...111000... where adjacent cells swap 01 <-> 10 when within triples 110 or 011.
%C A359303 This automaton is a toy model for diffusion. It is inspired by the "Unstable Diffusion" problem encountered on day 23 of the "Advent of Code 2022" challenge and it serves as a 1D counterpart to the 2D cellular automaton featured there.
%C A359303 The state is a bi-infinite string of 1's and 0's of the form ...1111 middle 0000...
%C A359303 The state is encoded in an integer by discarding the left infinite 1's and one 0 which follows, then interpret the rest left-to-right as binary least- to most-significant bit.
%C A359303 The state steps by locating all cells which will swap, and applying those swaps simultaneously.
%C A359303 In pattern 110, the 10 cells swap to become 01, and conversely in pattern 011 the 01 cells swap to become 10.
%C A359303 Patterns can overlap so that, for example, 0110 is an 011 and a 110 and the two swaps step to 1001.
%C A359303 Swaps conflict in a pattern 11011 since they try to swap the 0 both to the left and to the right. When this happens, neither of these conflicting swaps are applied.
%C A359303 At least one swap always occurs since the rightmost 11 pair is followed by 0 and this 110 has no further 11 after which would conflict.
%C A359303 The total number of 1's and 0's is preserved in each state (when taking some large enough part of the bi-infinite state).
