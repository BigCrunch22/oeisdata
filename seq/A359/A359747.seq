%N A359747 Numbers k such that k*(k+1) has in its canonical prime factorization mutually distinct exponents.
%C A359747 Equivalently, numbers k such that A002378(k) = k*(k+1) is a term of A130091.
%C A359747 Equivalently, numbers k such that the multisets of exponents in the prime factorizations of k and k+1 are disjoint and each have distinct elements.
%C A359747 Either k or k+1 is a powerful number (A001694). Except for k=8, are there terms k such that both k and k+1 are powerful (i.e., terms that are also in A060355)? None of the terms A060355(n) for n = 2..39 is in this sequence.
