%N A359668 Triangle read by rows. Each term of the triangle is positive and distinct. In row k are the next k least numbers such that the sum of any one number from each of the first k rows is a prime number.
%C A359668 Except for the prime sum of the single number 2 in the first row, each sum is equal to a twin prime.
%C A359668 For row k, the k! sums produce as many distinct primes, or, for row k >= 2, k!/2 distinct twin prime pairs.
%C A359668 Defining this same triangle from another angle, e.g., by discovering and describing a regularity in its structure, and/or proving its infinitude, is equivalent to proving the twin prime conjecture. An independent proof of the latter may not prove the infiniteness of this sequence, however.

%e A359668 a(5) = 12 because in row three, after a(4), a(5) is the second of the three least values in the row: both a(1) + a(2) + a(5) = 2 + 3 + 12 = 17 and a(1) + a(3) + a(5) = 2 + 5 + 12 = 19 are primes.
