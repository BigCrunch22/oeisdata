%N A359215 Number of terms in S(n) that did not appear in previous trajectories, where S(n) is the trajectory of the mappings of x->A359194(x) starting with n and stopping when 0 is reached, -1 if 0 is never reached.
%C A359215 "Branch length" of n->A359194(n).
%C A359215 a(0) = 0 since n = 0.
%C A359215 Let m be the first term in S(n) that has appeared in S(k), k < n. A359218(n) = m.
%C A359215 Analogous to A222118 which instead regards the Collatz function A006318.
