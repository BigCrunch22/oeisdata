%N A359263 Number of compositions of n into three parts, using only natural numbers not in A007283.
%C A359263 Strictly increasing, and hence the complement of A007283 gives a counterexample to a conjecture of Dombi (see Links) saying that a set with infinite complement cannot have its sequence of 3-compositions strictly increasing in cardinality.
%C A359263 The sequence is 2-regular, and has a linear representation of size 311.

%e A359263 For n=3 the 7 compositions are (1,1,1) and the six permutations of (0,1,2).
