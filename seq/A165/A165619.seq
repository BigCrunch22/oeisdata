%N A165619 a(n) = number of nonexistent values of cos(2*Pi/k) mod n, taken over k = 1..n-1.
%C A165619 See A164823 for explanatory comment and the definition of "cos(x) mod j".
%C A165619 It appears that a(n) = 0 for all n >= 1 other than n = 4 and n = any prime >= 5. Also, a(n) is even for all primes of the form 4m+3, with m >= 1, since, referring to the triangle in A165609, if c mod n is nonexistent then so is -c mod n.
