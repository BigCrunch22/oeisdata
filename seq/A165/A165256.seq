%N A165256 Numbers whose number of distinct prime factors equals the number of digits in the number.
%C A165256 Is this sequence finite? If the answer is yes, is there any estimate for the number of terms of this sequence? - _Parthasarathy Nambi_, Nov 16 2009
%C A165256 This sequence is finite since there are only finitely many primes less than 10. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Feb 04 2013
%C A165256 Specifically, all terms have <= 10 digits since primorial(k) = A002110(k) has > k digits for k > 10. - _Michael S. Branicky_, Apr 13 2023

%e A165256 The number of distinct prime factors of 4 is 1, which is the same as the number of digits in 4, so 4 is in the sequence.
%e A165256 The number of distinct prime factors of 21 is 2, which is the same as the number of digits in 21, so 21 is in the sequence.
%e A165256 However, 25 is NOT in the sequence because the number of distinct prime factors of 25 is 1, which does not match the number of digits in 25.
