%N A165227 Iteratively parse Pi until 9 of 10 digits have been found, with the remaining "lost" digit = the next term in the sequence.
%C A165227 a(176)=0, and it has the distinction of being the first "best case" scenario in which 9 out of 9 digits are distinct. Occurs at position 3312: "763594218". a(10562)=7, and it has the distinction of being the most elusive case in the first million digits of Pi, eluding 81 digits beginning at position 204249: "206589689495098835545433034480634690683626426926225260480503822296566585644546381".
%e A165227 a(1) = 0 because every digit except 0 occurs in the initial 14 digits of Pi: 31415926535897.
%e A165227 a(2) = 1 because every digit except 1 occurs in the next 19 digits of Pi: 9323846264338327950.
%e A165227 a(3) = 0 because every digit except 0 occurs in the next 16 digits of Pi: 2884197169399375.
%e A165227 a(4) = 6 because every digit except 6 occurs in the next 16 digits of Pi: 1058209749445923.
%e A165227 a(5) = 5 because every digit except 5 occurs in the next 22 digits of Pi: 0781640628620899862803.
