%N A165419 Each a(n) is chosen so that n = sum a(k), for all n >= 0, where k is over the distinct nonnegative values of the substrings in binary n.
%C A165419 We could have instead taken k over the distinct positive values of the substrings in binary n, and get the same sequence, since a(0)=0.
%C A165419 The distinct nonnegative values of the substrings of binary n is row n of table A119709. The distinct positive values of the substrings of binary n is row n of table A165416.
%e A165419 9 in binary is 1001. The distinct nonnegative integers that occur as substrings in binary 9 are 0, 1, 2 (10 in binary), 4 (100 in binary), and 9 (1001 in binary). And 9 = a(0) + a(1) + a(2) + a(4) + a(9) = 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 5.
