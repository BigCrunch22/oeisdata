%N A165714 Let the prime factorization of m be m = product p(m,k)^b(m,k), where p(m,j)<p(m,j+1) for all j, the p's are the distinct primes dividing m, and each b is a positive integer. Then a(n) = product_k {p(A165713(n), k)^b(n,k)}.
%C A165714 A165713(n) = the smallest integer > n that is divisible by exactly the same number of distinct primes as n is.
%e A165714 12 = 2^2 * 3^1, which is divisible by 2 distinct primes. The next larger integer divisible by exactly 2 distinct primes is 14 = 2^1 * 7^1. Taking the primes from the factorization of 14 and the exponents from the factorization of 12, we have a(12) = 2^2 * 7^1 = 28.
