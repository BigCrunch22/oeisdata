%N A165275 Table read by antidiagonals: T(n, k) is the k-th number with n-1 odd-power summands in its base 2 representation.
%C A165275 For n>=0, row n is the ordered sequence of positive integers m such that the number of odd powers of 2 in the base 2 representation of m is n.
%C A165275 Every positive integer occurs exactly once in the array, so that as a sequence it is a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A165275 For even powers, see A165274. For the number of even powers of 2 in the base 2 representation of n, see A139351; for odd, see A139352.
%C A165275 Essentially, (Row 0)=A000695, (Column 1)=A020988, also possibly (Column 2)=A007583.
%C A165275 It appears that, for n>=3, a(t(n)) = 4*a(t(n-1))+2, where t(n) is the n-th triangular number t(n)=n(n+1)/2 (A000217). [_John W. Layman_, Sep 15 2009]
