%N A165686 Dimension of the space of Siegel cusp forms of genus 2 and weight 2k which are not Saito-Kurokawa lifts of forms of genus 1.
%C A165686 Also the dimension of the largest Hecke-closed subspace of forms in S_k(Gamma_2) which satisfy the Ramanujan-Petersson conjecture. These forms are also characterized by the property that their (Andrianov) spinor zeta function does not have any pole.

%F A165686 For k > 1 we have a(k) = A165684(k) - A008615(2k-5).

%e A165686 a(20)=1 because there is exactly one Siegel modular form of genus 2 and weight 20 which is not a lift of some form of genus 1.
