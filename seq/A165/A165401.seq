%N A165401 Antidiagonally reading the array, formed via: first, writing the primes in the first row (row_1), and forming all successive rows' elements using the previous rows' elements as: row_2(j) = row_1(j)*row_1(j+1) - row_1(j) - row_1(j+1), and so on. The first 'column' of the array, 2 1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ... is converted to its absolute value.
%C A165401 The actual array that leads to the list given above is:
%C A165401 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 ...
%C A165401 1 7 23 59 119 191 287 395 ...
%C A165401 1 131 1275 6843 22419 54339 112683 241915 ...
%C A165401 1 165619 8716707 ...
%C A165401 1 1443643414307 ...
%C A165401 It can be observed that:
%C A165401 1) Obviously, all primes will appear in the list at least once, as the first row of the generating array is composed of all the primes.
%C A165401 2) There exist primes that appear more than once (e.g., 23, 59, 131, 191...).
%C A165401 3) When we have two successive primes in a row, prime(i) & prime(i+1) -as in all of the first row, and occasionally in other rows- the element just below these two is, obviously, Euler_tot( prime(i) * prime (i+1) ) - 1.
%Y A165401 Cf. A000040: The list of prime numbers is the first row of the array, that is converted to the list. Cf. A037165: This list, "Prime(n)*prime(n+1)-prime(n)-prime(n+1)" is the second row of the array, that is converted to the list.
