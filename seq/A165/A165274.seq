%N A165274 Table read by antidiagonals: T(n, k) is the k-th number with n-1 even-power summands in its base 2 representation.
%C A165274 For n>=0, row n is the ordered sequence of positive integers m such that the number of even powers of 2 in the base 2 representation of m is n.
%C A165274 Every positive integer occurs exactly once in the array, so that as a sequence it is a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A165274 For odd powers, see A165275.
%C A165274 For the number of even powers of 2 in the base 2 representation of n, see A139351; for odd, see A139352.
%C A165274 Essentially, (Row 0)=A062880, (Row 1)=A158705, (Column 1)=A002450, also possibly (Column 2)=A163832.
