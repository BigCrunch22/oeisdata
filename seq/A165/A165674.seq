%N A165674 Triangle generated by the asymptotic expansions of the E(x,m=2,n).
%C A165674 The higher order exponential integrals E(x,m,n) are defined in A163931. The asymptotic expansion of the E(x,m=2,n) ~ (exp(-x)/x^2)*(1 - (1+2*n)/x + (2+6*n+3*n^2)/x^2 - (6+22*n+18*n^2+ 4*n^3)/x^3 + ... ) is discussed in A028421. The formula for the asymptotic expansion leads for n = 1, 2, 3, .., to the left hand columns of the triangle given above.
%C A165674 The recurrence relations of the right hand columns of this triangle lead to Pascal's triangle A007318, their a(n) formulas lead to Wiggen's triangle A028421 and their o.g.f.s lead to Wood's polynomials A126671; cf. A080663, A165676, A165677, A165678 and A165679.
%C A165674 The row sums of this triangle lead to A093344. Surprisingly the e.g.f. of the row sums Egf(x) = (exp(1)*Ei(1,1-x) - exp(1)*Ei(1,1))/(1-x) leads to the exponential integrals in view of the fact that E(x,m=1,n=1) = Ei(n=1,x). We point out that exp(1)*Ei(1,1) = A073003.
%C A165674 The Maple programs generate the coefficients of the triangle given above. The first one makes use of a relation between the triangle coefficients, see the formulas, and the second one makes use of the asymptotic expansions of the E(x,m=2,n).
%C A165674 Amarnath Murthy discovered triangle A093905 which is the reversal of our triangle.
