%N A165514 The complement of the trapezoidal numbers.
%C A165514 Trapezoidal numbers (A165513) are polite numbers (A138591) that have a runsum representation which excludes one, and hence that can be depicted graphically by a trapezoid. This sequence is their complement, and Jones and Lord have shown that it is constructed from the powers of 2 (A000079), the perfect numbers (A000396) and those integers of the form 2^(k-1)*(2^k+1) where k is necessarily a power of 2 and 2^k + 1 is a Fermat prime (A019434).
%C A165514 Starting with 4, composite numbers (A002808) not a difference of non-neighboring triangular numbers (A000217). For T(x) - T(y), x - y > 1, where T are the triangular numbers, all other composite numbers can be represented as a triangular number difference. - _Ed Pegg Jr_, Feb 23 2016
