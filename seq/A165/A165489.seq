%N A165489 Eigensequence of triangle A084938.
%C A165489 Triangle A084938 * [1, 1, 1, 2, 6, 23, 105, 550,...] shifts left to [1, 1, 2, 6, 23, 105, 550,...].
%C A165489 Eigentriangle A165490 = A084938 * its eigensequence, A165489 as a diagonalized infinite lower triangular matrix.
%F A165489 The sequence can be obtained by shifting down triangle A084938 one row, then inserting a "1" as the first term, obtaining a new triangle Q. Then take the Lim_{n->inf.} Q^n, obtaining a shifted left column vector = A165489 prefaced with a 1. Delete the first 1, obtaining [1, 1, 2, 6, 23, 105, 550, 3236,...].
