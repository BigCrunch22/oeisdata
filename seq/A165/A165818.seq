%N A165818 Largest integer coprime to n whose binary representation is a substring of the binary representation of n.
%e A165818 14 in binary is 1110. The integers that, when written in binary, occur as substrings in 1110 are 0, 1, 2 (10 in binary), 3 (11 in binary), 6 (110 in binary), 7 (111 in binary), and 14 (1110 in binary). Of these, 3 is the largest that is coprime to 14. So a(14) = 3.
