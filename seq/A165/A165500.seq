%N A165500 Maximum length of arithmetic progression starting at n such that each term k has tau(k) = tau(n).
%C A165500 Implicitly, we require the difference d of the arithmetic progression to be positive.
%C A165500 a(n) <= n for all n.
%e A165500 For n=4, tau(n)=3 so each term of the arithmetic progression must be the square of a prime. The difference d must be odd for n+d to qualify, in which case n+2d is even and does not qualify; so a(4)=2 is an upper bound.
%Y A165500 Cf. A165498, A165501, A088430.
