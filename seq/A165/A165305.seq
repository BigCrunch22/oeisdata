%N A165305 a(n) is the smallest number not yet in the sequence such that the concatenation of all terms yields a periodic stream of digits 1, 2, 3, ..., 7 (repeat from 1).
%e A165305 For a(8), having already 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, the next number must be 12 because after 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 we shall continue with a 1.
%e A165305 But 1 is already in the sequence so we need to add a 2 -> 12. And so on.
