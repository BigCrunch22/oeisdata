%N A165805 Integers that start a trajectory x -> A008619(x) which contains only primes until terminating at 2 or 3.
%C A165805 Starting from n, the trajectory of repeated application of x -> x - ceiling(x/2), as represented by A008619, is monitored until it reaches 2 or 3. If the trajectory (ignoring the initial n) contains only primes, n is added to the sequence.
%C A165805 We are essentially requiring a chain of safe primes A005385 down to 2 or 3, in search of reverse Cunningham chains of the first type.
%C A165805 There are no more terms between 95 and 10000000. - _R. J. Mathar_, Sep 29 2009
%C A165805 No more terms between 95 and 1500000000 (i.e., 1.5*10^9). - _Owen Whitby_, Oct 16 2009
%C A165805 There are no terms larger than 95, which can be seen by following the chains up from 2 and 3. The only primes that go to 2 or 3 via the map x -> x - ceiling(x/2) are 5 and 7. The only prime that goes to 5 or 7 via that map is 11. The only prime that goes to 11 is 23, the only prime that goes to 23 is 47, and no prime number maps to 47 (since 95 is not prime). Thus the only numbers that can produce prime chains in this way are numbers x such that x-ceiling(x/2) is in {1,2,3,5,7,11,23,47}. - _Nathaniel Johnston_, Nov 22 2010
%e A165805 The trajectories of starting with numbers from 91 to 96 are
%e A165805   91 -> 45 -> 22 -> 11 -> 5 -> 2
%e A165805   92 -> 46 -> 23 -> 11 -> 5 -> 2
%e A165805   93 -> 46 -> 23 -> 11 -> 5 -> 2
%e A165805   94 -> 47 -> 23 -> 11 -> 5 -> 2
%e A165805   95 -> 47 -> 23 -> 11 -> 5 -> 2
%e A165805   96 -> 48 -> 24 -> 12 -> 6 -> 3
%e A165805 The trajectories starting at 91 to 93 and 96 contain composites 45, 46 or 48 and their initial numbers do not qualify for the sequence. The trajectories starting at 94 and 95 contain only primes (47, 23, 11, 5, 2) and their two initial integers 94 and 95 are added to the sequence.
