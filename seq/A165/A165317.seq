%N A165317 a(n) = the number of digits in the binary representation of n that each do not precede or follow a similarly valued digit.
%C A165317 A165316(n) + a(n) = the number of digits in the binary representation of n.
%C A165317 Also number of parts equal to 1 in the composition having index n. For the definition of the index of a composition see A298644. For example, a(18) = 3 since the binary form of 18 is (1)00(1)(0) which has 3 runs of length 1 (each placed between parentheses). The command c(n) from the Maple program yields the composition having index n. - _Emeric Deutsch_, Jan 29 2018

%e A165317 184 in binary is 10111001. There are exactly three binary digits (the first and last 1's, and the leftmost 0) that are each not adjacent to a similar digit. So a(184) = 3.
