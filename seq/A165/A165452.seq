%N A165452 Number of connected graphs of odd girth at least 7 with n vertices.
%C A165452 The odd girth of a graph is the length of a shortest cycle of odd length. Thus, these are the connected graphs that do not have a triangle or C_5 as induced subgraph. - _Falk Hüffner_, Jan 15 2016
%C A165452 The bipartite graphs (which have no odd cycles) are included.
