%N A165417 a(0) = a(1) = 1. For n >=2, a(n) = sum a(k), where k is over the distinct values of the substrings in binary n, and where 0 <= k < n.
%C A165417 The distinct nonnegative values of the substrings of binary n is row n of table A119709.
%C A165417 a(2^n) = 2^n, for all n.
%e A165417 9 in binary is 1001. The distinct nonnegative integers that occur as substrings in binary 9 are 0, 1, 2 (10 in binary), 4 (100 in binary), and 9 (1001 in binary). So a(9) = a(0)+a(1)+a(2)+a(4) = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8.
