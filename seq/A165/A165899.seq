%N A165899 Residue of n! after successive divisions by factors greater than n.
%e A165899 For n=8:
%e A165899 8!=40320 is divisible by 9 with a quotient of 4480;
%e A165899 4480 is divisible by 10 with a quotient of 448;
%e A165899 448 is not divisible by 11, 12 or 13, but is divisible by 14 with a quotient of 32;
%e A165899 32 is not divisible by 15, but is divisible by 16 with a quotient of 2;
%e A165899 2 is the final residue of the sequence since 16 > 2, therefore a(8)=2.
