%N A165217 Count of interior bounded regions in a regular 2n-sided polygon dissected by all diagonals parallel to sides.
%C A165217 The rule is: get a regular polygon with at least 6 sides and an even number of sides (hexagon, octagon, etc.) and pick a point, then pick the point directly clockwise it, draw a line then draw lines parallel to it going through the other points. Then do the same with all the other points. a(n) is the count of interior bounded regions.
