%N A165632 Sizes of tatami-free rooms.
%C A165632 Even numbers s such that some rectangle of size s=r*c (r,c positive integers) cannot be tiled with tatamis of size 1x2 such that not more than 3 tatamis meet at any point.
%C A165632 The number of different rectangles of size a(n) which have this property is given in A165633(n).
