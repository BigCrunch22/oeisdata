%N A165288 Possible values of the difference between a cube and the largest square not larger than the cube.
%C A165288 The values of A077116, sorted and duplicates removed.
%C A165288 Note that the values have been generated with a finite search radius and are not proved to be complete. [_R. J. Mathar_, Oct 09 2009]
%C A165288 Except for the leading 0, a subsequence of A229618 which is in turn (except for the initial 1) a subsequence of A106265.  The values {15, 18, 25, 44, 54, 61, 71, 72, 87, 106, 112, 118, 126, 127,...} are in  A229618 but not in the present sequence. Using results from A179386, it should be possible to prove that the sequence is complete up to a given point. - _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 26 2013
%e A165288 The gap 0 appears in 1^3-1^2 or 4^3-8^2 etc.
%e A165288 The gap 2 appears for example in 3^3-5^2.
%e A165288 The gap 4 appears for example in 2^3-2^2 or 5^3-11^2.
%e A165288 The gap 19 appears in 7^3-18^2, the gap 20 in 6^3-14^2.
