%N A165345 Number of ON cells after n generations of the 2D cellular automaton described in the comments.
%C A165345 The cells are the squares of the standard square grid. All cells are initially OFF and one cell is turned ON at generation 1. At subsequent generations a cell is ON if and only if (1) it was ON, or (2) exactly one of the four nearest side neighbors was ON, or (3) exactly three of the four nearest corner neighbors were ON, in the previous generation
%C A165345 The equivalent Mathematica automaton is obtained with neighborhood weights {{10,2,10},{2,1,2},{10,2,10}}, rule number 755364134566574, and initial configuration {{1}} (see code).
