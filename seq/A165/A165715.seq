%N A165715 Let the prime factorization of m be m = product p(m,k)^b(m,k), where p(m,j) < p(m, j+1) for all j, the p's are the distinct primes dividing m, and each b is a positive integer. Then a(n) = product {p(n,k)^b(A165713(n), k)}.
%C A165715 A165713(n) = the smallest integer > n that is divisible by exactly the same number of distinct primes as n is.
%e A165715 12 = 2^2 * 3^1, which is divisible by 2 distinct primes. The next larger integer divisible by exactly 2 distinct primes is 14 = 2^1 * 7^1. Taking the primes from the factorization of 12 and the exponents from the factorization of 14, we have a(12) = 2^1 * 3^1 = 6.
