%N A165315 a(1)=2. If s is the largest integer such that n = r^s, r = positive integer, then a(n) = the smallest integer > a(n-1) such that a(n) = t^s, t = positive integer.
%C A165315 The variable s need not necessarily be the largest integer such that a(n) = t^s, t = some positive integer. (For example, a(3) = 4 because 4 is a first power, like 3.)
%C A165315 If a(1) had equaled 1 instead, then the sequence would have been just the sequence of positive integers, obviously.

%e A165315 a(9) = 36 because 9 = 3^2, and because 36 is the smallest square > a(8) = 27.
