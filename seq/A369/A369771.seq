%N A369771 Number of the rightmost decimal digits of n^(n^n) that are the same as those of n^(n^(n^n)).
%C A369771 The common digits might include leading 0's (such as at n = 5) and they are included in the total.
%C A369771 Let c be a positive integer and assume that k is a positive integer that is not a multiple of 10. If n = k*10^c, then a(n) = c*(n^n) which is all the rightmost 0's of n^(n^n).

%F A369771 a(n) is such that n^(n^n) == n^(n^(n^n)) (mod 10^(a(n))) and n^(n^n) <> n^(n^(n^n)) (mod 10^(a(n)+1)).
%e A369771 a(-1) = 1 since (-1)^(-1) = -1 (which is a one-digit number);
%e A369771 a(0) = 0 since 0^0 = 1 so that 0^(0^0) = 0 and 0^(0^(0^0)) = 1 have no digits in common.
%e A369771 For n=5, a(n)=8 since 5^(5^5) == 908203125 (mod 10^9) while 5^(5^(5^5)) == 408203125 (mod 10^9).
