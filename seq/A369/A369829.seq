%N A369829 a(0) = 0; for n > 0, if n appears in the sequence  then a(n) = a(n-1) - sum of indexes where n appeared if that is nonnegative and not already in the sequence, otherwise a(n) = a(n-1) + sum of indexes. Otherwise a(n) = a(n-1) - n if nonnegative and not already in the sequence, otherwise a(n) = a(n-1) +  n.
%e A369829 a(3) = 5 as a(2) = 3 = n, thus the step size from a(2) is 2. As 1 has previously appeared a(3) = a(2) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5.
%e A369829 a(5) = 6 as a(3) = 5 = n, thus the step size from a(4) is 3. As 6 has not previously appeared a(5) = a(4) - 3 = 9 - 3 = 6.
%e A369829 a(29) = 2 as a(13) = 29 = n, and a(15) = 29, 13+15 is 28, thus the step size from a(2) is 28. As 2 has not previously appeared a(29) = a(29) - 28 = 30 - 28 = 2.
