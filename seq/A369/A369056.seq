%N A369056 Numbers k of the form 4m+3 for which there is no representation as a sum (p*q + p*r + q*r) with three odd primes p <= q <= r.
%C A369056 Numbers k in A004767 for which A369054(k) = 0.
%C A369056 Numbers k of the form 4m-1 such that they are not arithmetic derivative (A003415) of any term of A046316.
%C A369056 Question: Is it possible that this sequence might be finite (although very long)? See comments in A369055.
