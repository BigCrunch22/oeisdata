%N A369826 Number of the rightmost decimal digits of n^n that are the same as those of n^(n^n).
%C A369826 The common digits might include leading 0's (such as at n = 43) and those 0's are included in the count.
%C A369826 Common digits do not extend beyond the most significant digit of n^n, so that for instance a(5) = 4 stops at all digits of n^n = 3125.
%C A369826 a(-1) = 1 since (-1)^((-1)^(-1)) = (-1)^(-1) = -1 (which is a one-digit number);
%C A369826 a(0) = 0 since 0^0 = 1 and consequently 0^(0^0) = 0 and they have no digits in common.
%C A369826 a(n) = 0 if and only if n=0 or n == 2 or 18 (mod 20), see Links for details.
%C A369826 For n = k*10^c with c >= 1 and k != 0 (mod 10), a(n) = c*n which is the rightmost 0's of n^n.
%C A369826 From _Jianing Song_, Feb 13 2024: (Start)
%C A369826 For n >= 3, n^(n^n) - n^n is divisible by 32: let vp(N) denote the p-adic valuation of N and write n^(n^n) - n^n = n^n * (n^(n*(n^(n-1)-1)) - 1). For even n >= 4, we have v2(n^(n^n) - n^n) = v2(n^n) = n*v2(n) >= 5. For odd n, we have v2(n^(n^n) - n^n) = v2(n^(n*(n^(n-1)-1)) - 1) is 3*v2(n-1) + 2*v2(n+1) - 2 >= 5, with the equality holding if and only if v2(n-1) = 1 and v2(n+1) = 2, i.e., n == 3 (mod 8). As a result, for most n, the number of common digits is completely determined by the 5-adic valuation of n^(n^n) - n^n. For example, for n > 1, a(n) = 1 if and only if v5(n^4-1) = 1 and n == 3, 4, 7, 8, 12, 14 (mod 20), namely n being congruent to 3, 4, 8, 12, 14, 23, 27, 28, 34, 44, 47, 48, 52, 54, 63, 64, 67, 72, 83, 84, 87, 88, 92, 94 modulo 100.
%C A369826 Every number appears infinitely many times in this sequence: for a given m >= 1, let n be a solution to n == 0 (mod 2^max{m,2}) and n == -1 (mod 5^m), then n^(n^n) - n^n is divisible by 2^m. On the other hand, n*(n^(n-1)-1) is divisible by 4 but not by 5, so v5(n^(n^n) - n^n) = v5(n^(n*(n^(n-1)-1)) - 1) = v5(n^4-1) + v5(n*(n^(n-1)-1)) = v5(n^4-1) = m. (End)

%e A369826 For n=5, a(n)=4 since 5^5 = 3125 and 5^(5^5) == 203125 (mod 10^6).
