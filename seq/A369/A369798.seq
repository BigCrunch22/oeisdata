%N A369798 S is a "boomerang sequence": multiply each digit d of S by the number to which d belongs: the sequence S remains identical to itself if we follow each multiplication with a comma.
%C A369798 S is the lexicographycally earliest nontrivial sequence of nonnegative integers with this property (if we try for a(3) the integers 1, 10 or 11, we respectively get these trivial sequences):
%C A369798 S = 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...
%C A369798 S = 1, 10, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...
%C A369798 S = 1, 11, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...

%e A369798 a(1) = 0, which multiplied by 0 gives 0
%e A369798 a(2) = 1, which multiplied by 1 gives 1
%e A369798 a(3) = 12
%e A369798      1st digit is 1, which multiplied by 12 gives 12
%e A369798      2nd digit is 2, which multiplied by 12 gives 24
%e A369798 a(4) = 24
%e A369798      1st digit is 2, which multiplied by 24 gives 48
%e A369798      2nd digit is 4, which multiplied by 24 gives 96
%e A369798 a(5) = 48
%e A369798      1st digit is 4, which multiplied by 48 gives 192
%e A369798      2nd digit is 8, which multiplied by 48 gives 384
%e A369798 a(6) = 96
%e A369798      1st digit is 9, which multiplied by 96 gives 864
%e A369798      2nd digit is 6, which multiplied by 96 gives 576
%e A369798 Etc. We see that the above last column reproduces S.
