%N A369034 a(n) = 1 if A327860(n) is a multiple of 4, otherwise 0, where A327860 is the arithmetic derivative of the primorial base exp-function.
%C A369034 Asymptotic mean is most likely 1/8, but with a caveat similar to A358846 (consider how Chebyshev's bias, A038698, affects this and see comments in A235992, A327860, and especially in A360110. Note that A276086 never produces multiples of 4, so only way A327860(n) can be an even number is when A276086(n) is an odd number with an even number of prime factors with multiplicity (A046337), which set has the density 1/4. Assuming that for x = A276086(4*n), the arithmetic derivative x' is then evenly distributed between numbers of the form 4k and 4k+2, we get 1/4 * 1/2 = 1/8.
%C A369034 Compare to the empirical asymptotic means of A368994 and A369004, and also to A369653.
