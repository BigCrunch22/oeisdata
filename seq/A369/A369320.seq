%N A369320 Lexicographically earliest sequence such that each set of numbers enclosed by a pair of consecutive, equal terms, excluding the endpoints, is distinct.
%C A369320 The word 'set' means that every element is unique and order is irrelevant. {2,3}, for example, is equivalent to {3,2,2} and thus both could never appear in the sequence.
%C A369320 The pair of equal values a(n)=a(n+1) encloses the empty set {}, and thus after [a(1), a(2)] = [1, 1] no two equal values will occur one after the other.
%C A369320 A new value is always followed by 1.

%e A369320 a(2)=1, establishing the empty set, [1,1] -> {}.
%e A369320 a(4)=1, creating the set [1,2,1] -> {2}, which is distinct from any set enclosed by consecutive equal values that has appeared thus far.
%e A369320 a(8)=2. a(8) cannot be 1 since this would again create the empty set enclosed already by [a(1), a(2)] = [1, 1]. 2 creates the set [2,3,1,2] = {1,3} which is distinct from any other set thus far.
