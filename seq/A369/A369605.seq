%N A369605 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of inequivalent connected induced k-vertex subgraphs of the hypercube graph of dimension n >= 0, 1 <= k <= 2^n.
%C A369605 Two subgraphs are equivalent if there is an automorphism of the hypercube graph that takes one to the other.
%C A369605 Two isomorphic subgraphs may both be counted. For example, the path with 5 vertices is an induced subgraph of the 4-dimensional hypercube in two inequivalent ways: one that is contained in a 3-dimensional subcube and one that is not. This implies that T(4,5) > A369997(4,5). (In A369997, the subgraphs are counted up to isomorphism.)
%C A369605 Also, number of free k-celled polycubes in n dimensions, whose width in any coordinate direction is at most 2.
%C A369605 Also, number of k-celled polyominoes whose cells are subsets of the (n-1)-dimensional facets of the n-dimensional cross-polytope (or orthoplex). (See A049540.)
%C A369605 A039754 is the corresponding sequence for not necessarily connected subgraphs.
%F A369605 T(n,k) = A049540(k) for k <= n+1.
%F A369605 T(n,k) = A039754(n,k) for k > 2^n-n.

%e A369605 There are T(3,4) = 3 inequivalent connected induced 4-vertex subgraphs of the 3-cube: four vertices of a 2-dimensional face or three vertices of a face together with a vertex from the opposite face, adjacent to either of two inequivalent vertices from the first face.
