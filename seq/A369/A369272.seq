%N A369272 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not yet appeared that is a multiple of the smallest prime that does not divide n*a(n-1).
%C A369272 The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers, although it takes many terms for the primes to appear, e.g., a(63784) = 23.

%e A369272 a(7) = 4 as 2 is the smallest prime that does not divide a(6)*7 = 5*7 = 35, and 4 = 2*2 is the smallest multiple of 2 that has not yet appeared.
