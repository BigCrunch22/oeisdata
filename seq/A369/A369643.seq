%N A369643 a(n) = 1 if n' / gcd(n,n') is a multiple of 3, otherwise 0. Here n' stands for the arithmetic derivative of n, A003415.
%C A369643 a(n) = 1 if numerator of Sum(e/p: n=Product(p^e)) is of the form 3k, and 0 if it is not.
%C A369643 Question: Does this sequence have an asymptotic mean? Partial sums for range [1..10^n-1], for n=1..10 are: 2, 19, 208, 2196, 22346, 225544, 2267048, 22752664, 228098405, 2285194569.
