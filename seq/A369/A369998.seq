%N A369998 Number of connected induced subgraphs, up to isomorphism, of the hypercube graph of dimension n.
%C A369998 The null subgraph is not considered to be connected.
%C A369998 In A369606, two isomorphic subgraphs may both be counted, namely if there is no automorphism of the hypercube graph that takes one to the other. The first difference is a(4) = 194 < A369606(4) = 209. For example, the path with 5 vertices is an induced subgraph of the 4-dimensional hypercube in two inequivalent ways: one that is contained in a 3-dimensional subcube and one that is not.
%Y A369998 Row sums of A369997.
%Y A369998 Cf. A290758, A369606 (up to automorphisms of the hypercube), A369996 (not necessarily connected subgraphs).
