%N A369475 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence such that, from all indices n with the same a(n) value, the terms reached by a single jump are all distinct, where jumps are allowed from location i to i+-a(i).
%C A369475 Consider each index i as a location from which one can jump a(i) terms forwards or backwards. From all indices with the same a(n) value, every jump is to a distinct term.
%C A369475 Another way to define the sequence is to consider every possible ordered pair of values of the form (origin value, destination value)--every such ordered pair is distinct.

%e A369475 a(5)=4 because:
%e A369475 a(5) cannot be 1 because then we would have two jumps from a term with the same value 2, both landing on the value 1--ordered pair (2,1) twice:
%e A369475   1, 2, 2, 3, 1
%e A369475         2---->1
%e A369475   1<----2
%e A369475 a(5) cannot be 2 because we would have two jumps from the same a(n) value 2 to the same value 2--ordered pair (2,2) twice:
%e A369475   1, 2, 2, 3, 2
%e A369475         2---->2
%e A369475         2<----2
%e A369475 a(5) cannot be 3 because we would have two jumps from the same a(n) value 2 to the same a(n) value 3--ordered pair (2,3) twice:
%e A369475   1, 2, 2, 3, 3
%e A369475      2---->3
%e A369475         2---->3
%e A369475 a(5) can be 4 without contradiction.
