%N A369824 S is a "boomerang sequence": replace each digit d of S by its eighth power: the sequence S remains identical to itself if we follow each result with a comma.
%C A369824 S is the lexicographycally earliest sequence of nonnegative integers with this property.

%e A369824 a(1) = 0, which raised at the 8th power gives 0
%e A369824 a(2) = 1, which raised at the 8th power gives 1
%e A369824 a(3) = 256
%e A369824      1st digit is 2, which raised at the 8th power gives 256
%e A369824      2nd digit is 5, which raised at the 8th power gives 390625
%e A369824      3rd digit is 6, which raised at the 8th power gives 1679616
%e A369824 Etc. We see that the above last column reproduces S.
