%N A369659 Numbers that are not multiples of 3, but their arithmetic derivative is.
%C A369659 This is a subsequence of A373475, containing all its terms that are not multiples of 3. (See comments in A373475 for a proof). The first difference from A373475 is at n=4186, where A373475(4186) = 19683 = 3^9, the value which is missing from this sequence. - _Antti Karttunen_, Jun 07 2024
