%N A369659 Non-multiples of 3 whose arithmetic derivative, or equally, the sum of prime factors (with multiplicity) is a multiple of 3.
%C A369659 This is a subsequence of A373475, containing all its terms that are not multiples of 3. (See comments in A373475 for a proof). The first difference from A373475 is at n=4186, where A373475(4186) = 19683 = 3^9, the value which is missing from this sequence. - _Antti Karttunen_, Jun 07 2024
%C A369659 From _Antti Karttunen_, Jun 11 2024: (Start)
%C A369659 A multiplicative semigroup: if m and n are in the sequence, then so is m*n.
%C A369659 Numbers that are not multiples of 3, and the multiplicities of prime factors of the forms 3m+1 (A002476) and 3m-1 (A003627) are equal modulo 3.
%C A369659 Like A373597, which is a subsequence, also this sequence can be viewed as a kind of k=3 variant of A046337.
%C A369659 A289142, numbers whose sum of prime factors (with multiplicity, A001414) is a multiple of 3, is generated (as a multiplicative semigroup) by the union of this sequence with {3}.
%C A369659 A327863, numbers whose arithmetic derivative is a multiple of 3, is generated by this sequence and A008591.
%C A369659 A373478, numbers that are in the intersection of A289142 and A327863, is generated by the union of this sequence with {9, 27}.
%C A369659 A373475, numbers that are in the intersection of A289142 and A369644 (positions of multiples of 3 in A083345), is generated by the union of this sequence with {19683}, where 19683 = 3^9.
%C A369659 (End)
%C A369659 The integers in the multiplicative subgroup of positive rationals generated by semiprimes of the form 3m+2 (A344872) and cubes of primes except 27. - _Peter Munn_, Jun 19 2024

%e A369659 280 = 2*2*2*5*7 is included as it is not a multiple of 3, and one of its prime factors (7) is of the form 3m+1 and four are of the form 3m-1, and because 4 == 1 (mod 3). Also, A001414(280) = 18, and A003415(280) = 516, both of which are multiples of 3. - _Antti Karttunen_, Jun 12 2024
