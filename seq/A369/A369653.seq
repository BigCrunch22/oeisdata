%N A369653 a(n) = 1 if A327860(n) is a multiple of 3, otherwise 0, where A327860 is the arithmetic derivative of the primorial base exp-function.
%C A369653 Asymptotic mean is 4/9: One third of the primorial base representations (A049345 from which the intermediate value x = A276086(n) is built from) have "2" as their second rightmost digit (out of 0, 1, 2). That 2 is converted by A276086 to 3^2, so as x is a multiple of nine, it is guaranteed that x' [= A003415(x)] gives a multiple of three. If the second rightmost digit is "1", then x = A276086(n) is a multiple of 3 (but not of 9), and its arithmetic derivative, x' = 3*(x/3)' + (x/3), certainly is not a multiple of 3. This leaves the case where the second rightmost digit is "0", and assuming now that in this case the modulo 3 remainders are evenly distributed for x', it gives here 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9 probability that x' is a multiple of 3, so the total probability is 1/3 + 0 + 1/9 = 4/9.
%C A369653 Compare also to A369034 and A359430.
