%N A369653 a(n) = 1 if A327860(n) is a multiple of 3, otherwise 0, where A327860 is the arithmetic derivative of the primorial base exp-function.
%C A369653 Conjecture: asymptotic mean is 4/9: One third of the primorial base representations (A049345 from which the intermediate value x = A276086(n) is built from) have "2" as their second rightmost digit (out of 0, 1, 2). That 2 is converted by A276086 to 3^2, so as x is a multiple of nine, it is guaranteed that x' [= A003415(x)] gives a multiple of three. If the second rightmost digit is "1", then x = A276086(n) is a multiple of 3 (but not of 9), and its arithmetic derivative, x' = 3*(x/3)' + (x/3), certainly is not a multiple of 3. This leaves the case where the second rightmost digit is "0", and conjecturing now in this case that the modulo 3 remainders are eventually evenly distributed for x' (see A359430 and A373256), at least among the number of the form A048103, it gives in this case 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9 probability that x' is a multiple of 3, so the total probability would be 1/3 + 0 + 1/9 = 4/9. Note that Sum_{i=1..10^n} a(i), for n = 1..8 gives: 3, 43, 443, 4443, 44443, 444443, 4444444, 44444444, so empirically the value 4/9 seems very sharp. - revised Jun 18 2024.
