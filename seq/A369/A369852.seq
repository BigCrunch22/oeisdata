%N A369852 a(1)=1, a(2)=2; thereafter, any two indices n with different a(n) values reach distinct values by a single jump, where jumps are allowed from location i to i+a(i).
%C A369852 Consider each index i as a location from which one can jump a(i) terms forward. To find a(n) we have to check 2 conditions:
%C A369852 1. The value a(n) can be reached in one jump by at most one distinct value.
%C A369852 2. Location n reaches a location in one jump that is not reached in one jump from a location before n.
%C A369852 Another way to view the sequence is to consider the sets of values that can be reached from each distinct integer by a single jump forward (values reached by 1s in the sequence, values reached by 2s, 3s etc.): all of these sets are disjoint.

%e A369852 a(4)=3 because:
%e A369852   a(4) cannot be 1 because then we would have two distinct values (a(3)=2, a(4)=1) that reach the same future value a(5)=x:
%e A369852   1, 2, 2, 1, x
%e A369852         2---->x
%e A369852            1->x
%e A369852   a(4) cannot be 2 because then we would have two distinct values (a(1)=1, a(2)=2) reach the same value 2:
%e A369852   1, 2, 2, 2
%e A369852   1->2
%e A369852      2---->2
%e A369852   a(4) can be 3 without contradiction since there is only one distinct value that can reach the value 3 (a(2)=2):
