%N A369658 a(n) = 1 if n is not multiple of 3, but its arithmetic derivative is, otherwise 0.
%C A369658 Conjecture: the asymptotic mean of this sequence is (2/3)*(1/3) = 2/9. Compare to the comment at A369653, but consider also the four lowermost rows of the table given at A369252 (and further generalizations to various number of primes), and also A007352, A096629, and how they affect such probabilities.
