%N A369323 Lexicographically earliest sequence such that each set of numbers enclosed by a pair of consecutive, equal terms, including the endpoints, is distinct.
%C A369323 The word 'set' means that every element is unique and order is irrelevant. {2,3}, for example, is equivalent to {3,2,2} and thus both could never appear in the sequence.
%C A369323 A new value is always followed by 1.

%e A369323 a(2)=1, creating the set, [1,1] -> {1}, which is distinct from any set enclosed by consecutive equal values that has appeared thus far.
%e A369323 a(5)=3. a(5) cannot be 1 because this would again create the set enclosed by [a(1), a(2)] = [1,1]. a(5) cannot be 2 because this would again create the set {1,2} enclosed by [a(2)..a(4)] = [1,2,1]. a(5)=3 creates no new sets and so there is no restriction.
