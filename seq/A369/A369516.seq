%N A369516 Numbers k in A126706 such that neither k-1 nor k+1 is in A126706.
%C A369516 Singletons in A126706.
%C A369516 The smallest odd term is 63.
%C A369516 Terms are even or divisible by 3, or both. Does not include k coprime to 6; k in A369954 are not in this sequence.

%e A369516 Define quality Q to signify a number k neither squarefree nor prime power, i.e., k is in A126706. For example, 12 has quality Q but k = 1..11 do not.
%e A369516 The number 12 is in the sequence since it has quality Q, but neither 11 nor 13 do.
%e A369516 The number 44 is not in the sequence since 45 has quality Q.
%e A369516 The number 99 is not in the sequence because both 98 and 100 have quality Q, etc.
