%N A369793 a(n) is the number of occurrences of n in A063655.
%C A369793 Construct a directed graph whose vertex set is the set of all positive integers, and a directed edge from k to n belongs to this graph iff A063655(k) = n. a(n) is the in-degree of the vertex n in this graph. As conjectured in A369110, it is also conjectured here that the only cycles in this graph are from 4 to itself and between 5 and 6.
%e A369793 a(1) = 0 since 1 does not exist in A063655. This is also clear from the definition of A063655, because there is no integral rectangle with semiperimeter 1.
%e A369793 a(2) = 1 because there is only one integral rectangle of area 1 with a minimal semiperimeter 2, which is the 1 X 1 square. So 2 appears only once in A063655, which means a(2) = 1.
%e A369793 a(4) = 2, because only A063655(3) and A063655(4) have the value 4. For any n > 4, A063655(n) > 4, because A063655(n) > 2 * sqrt(n) > 2 * sqrt(4) = 4. Hence, 4 cannot appear in the rest of A063655.
