%N A369234 A longest "diamond" sequence (38 terms). See the Comments section for details.
%C A369234 All terms are positives and distinct.
%C A369234 No duplicate digit is visible in the set {a(n), a(n+1), a(n)+a(n+1), |a(n)-a(n+1)|}.
%C A369234 If we place the successive sums above the successive commas of the sequence and if we place the successive absolute differences under the said commas, we form three lines of integers that can be seen as a succession of diamonds - hence the name of the sequence.
%C A369234 The "diamond" graph has 59 nodes and 97 edges, where two nodes are linked if they admit a "diamond" (see linked adjacency list). This sequence presents a longest simple path in that graph, namely the lexicographically earliest of the 180 length-38 paths (reversals counted).  Longest paths were found using (exhaustive) depth-first search from each start node, remembering paths of longest depth and ties to compute the lexicographically earliest.  This was independently confirmed by generating all simple paths in the graph exhaustively, using all_simple_paths in Python's networkx library.
