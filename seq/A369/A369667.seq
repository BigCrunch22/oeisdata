%F A369667 These formulas should be computed with a shortcut multiplication, which ignores the right hand side expression if the left hand side yields zero:
%F A369667 a(n) = A358773(n) * A065043(n).
%F A369667 a(n) = [A003415(n) == 3 (mod 4)] * [A001222(n) == 0 (mod 2)], where [ ] is the Iverson bracket.
