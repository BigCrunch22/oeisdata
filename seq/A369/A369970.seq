%S A369970 0,1,6,2315,510510
%N A369970 Numbers k such that A003415(k) is a multiple of A276086(k), where A003415 is the arithmetic derivative, and A276086 is the primorial base exp-function.
%C A369970 For the general dynamics of this phenomenon, see the scatter plots of A351231 and A351233.
%C A369970 Question: Are the terms by necessity all squarefree?
%C A369970 As a subsequence this sequence includes all primorials with indices k such that A024451(k) is a multiple of A000040(1+k). See A369972 and A369973.
%C A369970 872415232 < a(6) <= 13082761331670030 [= A369973(4)].

%e A369970 2315 is included as A003415(2315) = 5+463 = 468 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 13 (note that 2315 is a semiprime = 5*463, thus its arithmetic derivative is the sum of its two prime factors), and because that 468 is a multiple of A276086(2315) = 234 = 2 * 3^2 * 13 [the exponents of primes are here read from the primorial base expansion of 2315, A049345(2315) = 100021].
%e A369970 510510 is included because A003415(510510) = 19*37693, which is a multiple of A276086(510510) = 19.
