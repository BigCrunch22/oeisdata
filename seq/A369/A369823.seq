%N A369823 S is a "boomerang sequence": replace each digit d of S by its sixth power: the sequence S remains identical to itself if we follow each result with a comma.
%C A369823 S is the lexicographycally earliest sequence of nonnegative integers with this property.

%e A369823 a(1) = 0, which raised at the 6th power gives 0
%e A369823 a(2) = 1, which raised at the 6th power gives 1
%e A369823 a(3) = 4096
%e A369823      1st digit is 4, which raised at the 6th power gives 4096
%e A369823      2nd digit is 0, which raised at the 6th power gives 0
%e A369823      3rd digit is 9, which raised at the 6th power gives 531441
%e A369823      4th digit is 6, which raised at the 6th power gives 46656
%e A369823 Etc. We see that the above last column reproduces S.
