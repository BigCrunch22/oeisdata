%N A369254 Numbers k that have an odd number of divisors that are at most sqrt(k).
%e A369254 1 has just one divisor 1, which is <= sqrt(1), therefore 1 is included.
%e A369254 Of the two divisors of 2, [1, 2], only 1 is at most sqrt(2), therefore 2 is included.
%e A369254 Of the three divisors of 4, [1, 2, 4], the first two are <= sqrt(4), and as two is not an odd number, 4 is NOT included in this sequence.
