%N A369055 Number of representations of 4n-1 as a sum (p*q + p*r + q*r) with three odd primes p <= q <= r.
%C A369055 Number of solutions to 4n-1 = x', where x' is the arithmetic derivative of x (A003415), and x is a product of three odd primes, A046316.
%C A369055 The number of 0's in range [1..10^n], for n=1..7 are: 8, 46, 288, 2348, 21330, 206355, 2079925, etc.
%C A369055 Goldbach's conjecture can be expressed by claiming that each even number > 4 is an arithmetic derivative of an odd semiprime, as (p*q)' = p+q, where p and q are odd primes. One way to extend Goldbach's conjecture to three primes involves applying the arithmetic derivative to all possible products of three odd primes (A046316) as: (p*q*r)' = (p*q) + (p*r) + (q*r), and asking, "Onto which subset of natural numbers does this map surjectively?" Clearly, the above formula can only produce numbers of the form 4m+3, and furthermore, an analysis at A369252 shows that the trisections of this sequence have quite different expected values, being on average the highest in the trisection A369462, which gives the number of representations for the numbers of the form 12m+11. This motivates a new kind of Goldbach-3 conjecture: "All numbers of the form 12*m-1, with m large enough, have at least one representation as a sum (p*q + p*r + q*r) with three odd primes p <= q <= r." Furthermore, empirical data for sequence A369463 suggests that "large enough" in this case might well be 4224080, as 1+(12*4224079) = 50688949 = A369463(285), with the next term of A369463 so far unknown. Similar conjectures can be envisaged for the arithmetic derivatives of products of four or more primes. - _Antti Karttunen_, Jan 25 2024

%e A369055 a(7) = 1 because 4*7 - 1 = 27, which can be represented as a sum of the form (p*q) + (p*r) + (q*r), with all three primes p, q and r = 3.
