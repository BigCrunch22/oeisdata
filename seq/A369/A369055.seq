%N A369055 Number of representations of 4n-1 as a sum (p*q + p*r + q*r) with three odd primes p <= q <= r.
%C A369055 Number of solutions to 4n-1 = x', where x' is the arithmetic derivative of x (A003415), and x is a product of three odd primes, A046316.
%C A369055 The number of 0's in range [1..10^n], for n=1..7 are: 8, 46, 288, 2348, 21330, 206355, 2079925, etc.
%C A369055 The very hypothetical possibility that there might be only a finite number of zeros in this sequence (implying that A369056 would be finite) is a variation of the problem which considers whether all even numbers > 4 can be expressed as an arithmetic derivative of an odd semiprime. The latter is the famous Goldbach conjecture in another guise (see e.g., A351029), therefore we could regard this hypothesis as a yet another kind of Goldbach variant involving three primes.

%F A369055 a(n) = A369054(4*n-1).
%F A369055 a(n) = Sum_{i=1..A002620(4*n-1)} A369058(i)*[A003415(i)==4*n-1], where [ ] is the Iverson bracket.
%e A369055 a(7) = 1 because 4*7 - 1 = 27, which can be represented as a sum of the form (p*q) + (p*r) + (q*r), with all three primes p, q and r = 3.
%e A369055 a(19) = 1 because 4*19 - 1 = 75, which can be represented as a sum of the form (p*q) + (p*r) + (q*r) in two ways, with p=3, q=3 and r=11, or with p = q = r = 5.
%e A369055 a(9999995) = 0 because (4*9999995)-1 = 39999979, which cannot be expressed as a sum (p*q) + (p*r) + (q*r) for any three odd primes p, q and r, whether distinct or not.
