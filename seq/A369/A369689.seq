%N A369689 a(n) is the least positive number k such that k^2 is the concatenation of m and m + n for some positive number m, or -1 if there is no such k.
%C A369689 a(n) is the least number k > 0, if it exists, such that k^2 = (10^d + 1) m + n for some m > 0 where 10^(d-1) <= m + n < 10^d.
%C A369689 The attached file a369689.txt has lines n k m where k = a(n) and k^2 is the concatenation of m and m + n, n -1 where a(n) can be proven to be -1, and n -1 ? where I have not found a k that works but I have not been able to prove that a(n) = -1.

%e A369689 a(3) = 5 because 5^2 = 25 is the concatenation of 2 and 2 + 3 = 5, and 5 is the least m that works.
%e A369689 a(7) = -1 because it can be proven that 7 is not a square mod (10^d + 1) for any d, and therefore there are no k and m such that k^2 is the concatenation of m and m + 7.
