%N A369303 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest unused number whose string value contains the comma transform (cf. A367360) of the previous two terms.
%C A369303 The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers. The fixed points begin 1, 2, 10, 11, 2863, 3164, 3545, 3947, 6835, 6947, 7052, ... although it is likely there are infinitely more.

%e A369303 a(3) = 12 as the comma transform of 1 and 2 is 12.
%e A369303 a(6) = 112 as the comma transform of 21 and 22 is 12, but 12 has already appeared so the next lowest unused number to contain '12' is 112.
