%N A369891 Minimum possible uncovered area when at most k squares of side k, k = 1..n, are packed into a square of side n*(n+1)/2 = A000217(n).
%C A369891 The total area of the small squares is equal to the area of the large square, because 1^3+2^3+...+n^3 = (1+2+...+n)^2 = (n*(n+1)/2)^2 (Nicomachus's theorem).
%C A369891 The small squares are assumed to be oriented in the same way as the large square.
%C A369891 The partridge puzzle for size n is to determine whether a(n) = 0. The generalization considered here was suggested by _Rodolfo Kurchan_.
%C A369891 Apparently, Robert T. Wainwright showed that a(12) = 0. This was also shown by Ågren et al., and Carl F. Schwenke noted that their solution can be modified to show that also a(14) = 0 and a(16) = 0.
%C A369891 Is a(n) = 0 for all n >= 8?
