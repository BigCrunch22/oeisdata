%N A369989 Infinite word formed by expanding terms of A372257 by the map h : 0 -> {1,0,1}, 1 -> {1,0,0,1}, 2 -> {1,0,0,0,1}, 3 -> {1,0,0,0,0,1}.
%C A369989 This is word "y" of Berstel et al.
%C A369989 They construct this sequence (and A372258 "z") as an example infinite word of 2 symbols which is uniformly recurrent, has subwords closed under reversal, but only has a finite set of palindrome subwords.
%C A369989 There are 24 palindrome subwords and they can be found using Berstel et al's proof that it's enough to look in all h(T) where T is a length 3 subword occurring in A372257.
%C A369989 Blocks of 18 terms a(18*i,...,18*i+17) can be calculated from blocks of 4 terms A372257(4*i,...,4*i+3) since the latter are 0,1 or 1,0 then 2,3 or 3,2 (by the construction there), and so always expand to 18 terms under h.
%C A369989 This is a morphic sequence, meaning a symbol to symbol mapping of the fixed point of a morphism (for instance a uniform morphism based on the bits of n and how they result in remainder n mod 18 and bits of the corresponding quotient).
