%N A245904 a(n) is the number of permutations avoiding 231 and 312 realizable on increasing strict binary trees with 2n-1 nodes.
%C A245904 The number of permutations avoiding 231 and 312 in the classical sense which can be realized as labels on an increasing strict binary tree with 2n-1 nodes. A strict binary tree is a tree graph where each node has 0 or 2 children. The permutation is found by reading the labels in the order they appear in a breadth-first search. (Note that breadth-first search reading word is equivalent to reading the tree left to right by levels, starting with the root.)
%C A245904 In some cases, more than one tree results in the same breadth-first search reading word, but here we count the permutations, not the trees.
%e A245904 For example, when n=3, the permutations 12543, 12435, 13245, 13254, 12345,and 12354. all avoid 231 and 312 in the classical sense and occur as breadth-first search reading words on an increasing strict binary tree with 5 nodes.
