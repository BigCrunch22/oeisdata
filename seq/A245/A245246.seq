%N A245246 Number of ways to delete an edge (up to the outcome) in the simple unlabeled graphs on n nodes.
%C A245246 Also, the number of distinct pairs (G,H) of simple unlabeled graphs on n nodes, where H can be obtained from G by deletion of a single edge.
%C A245246 For n<6, we have a(n) = A126122(n), since the non-isomorphic edges in a graph on n<6 nodes uniquely define the result of their deletion. However, there is a graph on 6 nodes (see link below) with two non-isomorphic edges, deletion of either of which results in the same graph. Hence, for n>=6, a(n) < A126122(n).
