%N A245905 Zero followed by the terms of A023705 arranged to give the unique path to the n-th node of a complete, rooted and ordered ternary tree.
%C A245905 There is no path to the root node so first node path is 0. All other paths are represented by the terms of A023705 that are base 4 numbers containing no zeros. Starting at the lowest order digit base 4, if this is 1 then the path from the root node is to the left, if it is 2 straight on and if it is 3 to the right. Each successive digit order defines the next path to be taken until the highest digit order is reached and the specified node found.

%e A245905 a(33)=39, so the path to the 33rd node is given by 39 and when represented as the base 4 number gives 213. Hence the path to the 33rd node from the root node is Right, Left, Straight.
