%N A245898 Number of permutations avoiding 231 that can be realized on increasing unary-binary trees with n nodes.
%C A245898 The number of permutations avoiding 231 in the classical sense which can be realized as labels on an increasing unary-binary tree with n nodes read in the order they appear in a breadth-first search. (Note that breadth-first search reading word is equivalent to reading the tree left to right by levels, starting with the root.)
%C A245898 In some cases, more than one tree results in the same breadth-first search reading word, but here we count the permutations, not the trees.
%e A245898 For example, when n=4, the permutations 1234, 1243, 1324, and 1423 all avoid 231 in the classical sense and occur as breadth-first search reading words on an increasing unary-binary tree with 4 nodes:
%e A245898        1           1           1           1
%e A245898       / \         / \         / \         / \

%Y A245898 A245901 is the terms of A245898 with odd indices. A245888 is the number of increasing unary-binary trees whose breadth-first reading word avoids 231.
