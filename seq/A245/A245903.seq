%N A245903 Number of permutations of length 2n-1 avoiding 321 that can be realized on increasing binary trees.
%C A245903 The number of permutations of length 2n-1 avoiding 321 in the classical sense which can be realized as labels on an increasing binary tree read in the order they appear in a breadth-first search. (Note that breadth-first search reading word is equivalent to reading the tree left to right by levels, starting with the root.)
%C A245903 In some cases, more than one tree results in the same breadth-first search reading word, but here we count the permutations, not the trees.

%e A245903 For n=3, the a(3)= 10 permutations can be read from the sample trees given in the Links section above.
%Y A245903 A245903 appears to be the terms of A245900 with odd indices. A245896 is the number of increasing unary-binary trees whose breadth-first reading word avoids 321.
