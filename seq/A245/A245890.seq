%N A245890 Number of labeled increasing unary-binary trees on n nodes whose breadth-first reading word avoids 321.
%C A245890 The number of labeled increasing unary-binary trees with an associated permutation avoiding 321 in the classical sense.  The tree's permutation is found by recording the labels in the order in which they appear in a breadth-first search.  (Note that a breadth-first search reading word is equivalent to reading the tree labels left to right by levels, starting with the root.)
%C A245890 In some cases, the same breadth-first search reading permutation can be found on differently shaped trees.  This sequence gives the number of trees, not the number of permutations.
%H A245890 Manda Riehl, <a href="/A245890/a245890.png">The 9 trees when n=4.</a>
%e A245890 When n=4, a(n)=9.  In the Links above we show the nine labeled increasing trees on four nodes whose permutation avoids 321.
%Y A245890 A245896 gives the number of binary trees instead of unary-binary trees.  A245900 gives the number of permutations which avoid 321 that are breadth-first reading words on labeled increasing unary-binary trees.
