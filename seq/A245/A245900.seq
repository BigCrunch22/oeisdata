%N A245900 Number of permutations of [n] avoiding 321 that can be realized on increasing unary-binary trees.
%C A245900 The number of permutations avoiding 321 in the classical sense which can be realized as labels on an increasing unary-binary tree read in the order they appear in a breadth-first search. (Note that breadth-first search reading word is equivalent to reading the tree left to right by levels, starting with the root.)
%C A245900 In some cases, more than one tree results in the same breadth-first search reading word, but here we count the permutations, not the trees.
%e A245900 For example, when n=4, a(n)=4. The permutations 1234, 1243, 1324, and 1423 all avoid 321 in the classical sense and occur as breadth-first search reading words on an increasing unary-binary tree with 4 nodes:
%e A245900        1           1           1           1
%e A245900       / \         / \         / \         / \
%e A245900      2   3       2   4       3   2       4   2
%e A245900      |           |           |               |
%e A245900      4           3           4               3
%Y A245900 Cf. A245903 (odd bisection).
%Y A245900 A245890 is the number of increasing unary-binary trees whose breadth-first reading word avoids 321.
