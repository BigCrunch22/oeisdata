%N A245894 Number of labeled increasing binary trees on 2n-1 nodes whose breadth-first reading word avoids 231.
%C A245894 The number of labeled increasing binary trees with an associated permutation avoiding 231 in the classical sense.  The treeâ€™s permutation is found by recording the labels in the order they appear in a breadth-first search.  (Note that a breadth-first search reading word is equivalent to reading the tree labels left to right by levels, starting with the root).
%C A245894 In some cases, the same breadth-first search reading permutation can be found on differently shaped trees.  This sequence gives the number of trees, not the number of permutations.

%e A245894 When n=3, a(n)=14.  In the Links above we show the fourteen labeled increasing binary trees on five nodes whose permutation avoids 231.
%Y A245894 A245888 gives the number of unary-binary trees instead of binary trees.
%Y A245894 A245901 gives the number of permutations which avoid 231 that are breadth-first reading words on labeled increasing binary trees.
