%N A245899 a(n) is the number of permutations avoiding 312 that can be realized on increasing unary-binary trees with n nodes.
%C A245899 The number of permutations avoiding 312 in the classical sense which can be realized as labels on an increasing unary-binary tree read in the order they appear in a breadth-first search. (Note that breadth-first search reading word is equivalent to reading the tree left to right by levels, starting with the root.)
%C A245899 In some cases, more than one tree results in the same breadth-first search reading word, but here we count the permutations, not the trees.

%e A245899 For example, when n=4, a(n)=3. The permutations 1234, 1243, and 1324 all avoid 312 in the classical sense and occur as breadth-first search reading words on an increasing unary-binary tree with 4 nodes:

%Y A245899 A245902 appears to be the odd-indexed terms of this sequence.
