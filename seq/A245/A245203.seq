%N A245203 Least k>=0 such that A004767(n) = 4n+3 is the mean of primes 4(n-k)+3 and 4(n+k)+3; or -1 if no such k exists.
%C A245203 It has been conjectured that A004767(n) = 4n+3 is either prime or the mean of two primes in sequence A004767.
%C A245203 See A244952 and A245205 for record values and indices of these records. Some of these records are a(97)=27, a(1139)=120, a(10181)=225, a(93124)=435, a(864901)=894, ...
