%N A245761 Numbers with a maximal multiplicative persistence of 1 in any base.
%e A245761 12 is in the sequence since the persistence of 12 is at most 1 in any base. I.e. it takes at most one step to go from 12 to a single digit in any base, e.g., in base 2 we have 1100 -> 0. In base 5 we have 22 -> 4. In bases 12 and above the initial number is already a single digit.
%e A245761 This sequence is complete - there are no other terms. - _Alois P. Heinz_, Jul 31 2014
