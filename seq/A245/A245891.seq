%N A245891 Number of labeled increasing unary-binary trees on n nodes whose breadth-first reading word avoids 213 and 321.
%C A245891 The number of labeled increasing unary-binary trees with an associated permutation avoiding 213 and 321 in the classical sense.  The tree's permutation is found by recording the labels in the order in which they appear in a breadth-first search.  (Note that a breadth-first search reading word is equivalent to reading the tree labels left to right by levels, starting with the root.)
%C A245891 In some cases, the same breadth-first search reading permutation can be found on differently shaped trees.  This sequence gives the number of trees, not the number of permutations.
%H A245891 Manda Riehl, <a href="/A245891/a245891.png">The 7 trees when n = 4.</a>
%e A245891 When n=4, a(n)=7.  In the Links above we show the seven labeled increasing trees on four nodes whose permutation avoids 213 and 321.
%Y A245891 A126223 gives the number of binary trees instead of unary-binary trees.  A033638 gives the number of permutations which avoid 213 and 321 that are breadth-first reading words on labeled increasing unary-binary trees.
