%N A245889 Number of labeled increasing unary-binary trees on n nodes whose breadth-first reading word avoids 312.
%C A245889 The number of labeled increasing unary-binary trees with an associated permutation avoiding 312 in the classical sense.  The tree's permutation is found by recording the labels in the order in which they appear in a breadth-first search.  (Note that a breadth-first search reading word is equivalent to reading the tree labels left to right by levels, starting with the root.)
%C A245889 In some cases, the same breadth-first search reading permutation can be found on differently shaped trees.  This sequence gives the number of trees, not the number of permutations.

%e A245889 When n=4, a(n)=8.  In the Links above we show the eight labeled increasing trees on four nodes whose permutation avoids 312.
%Y A245889 A245895 gives the number of binary trees instead of unary-binary trees.  A245899 gives the number of permutations which avoid 312 that are breadth-first reading words on labeled increasing unary-binary trees.
