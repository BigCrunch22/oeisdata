%N A245628 Sequence has property that when divided into chunks by cutting it before each digit '1', each chunk contains exactly one 1, two 2's, three 3's, ..., and nine 9's. See Comments for more detailed definition.
%C A245628 Created in an attempt to capture the intention of _Amarnath Murthy_'s A110354. (That entry is beyond repair.)
%C A245628 Here is _Eric Angelini_'s description: (Start)
%C A245628 Cut the sequence into successive chunks of digits such that all chunks start with the digit '1'. Every chunk must now contain exactly one digit 1, two digits 2, three digits 3, ..., nine digits 9. The sequence is always extended with the smallest unused integer not leading to a contradiction such that any chunk 'c' shows first the required quantity of 1's, then the required quantity of 2's, then the 3's, ..., 9's.
%C A245628 The first chunk starts with a(1)=1 and ends with the second digit of "991". This chunk contains exactly one 1, two 2's, three 3's, etc. Note that a(3) cannot be equal to "3" because the required quantity of 2's is not yet reached in the chunk; neither can we have a(3)="12" as the chunk would contain two 1's; thus a(3)="23". The second chunk starts with the last digit of "991" and ends with the fourth digit of "99991". The third chunk starts with the last digit of "99991" and continues with "223" as this is the smallest available integer not leading to a contradiction, etc. (End) (adapted by _Jens Kruse Andersen_ to match corrected sequence)
%C A245628 The concatenation of all terms is "122333444455555666666777777788888888999999999" repeated forever. This infinite string is split into integers by always picking the shortest unused substring. - _Jens Kruse Andersen_, Jul 29 2014
