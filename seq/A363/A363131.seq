%N A363131 Number of non-co-modes in the prime factorization of n.
%C A363131 We define a non-co-mode in a multiset to be an element that appears more times than at least one of the others. For example, the non-co-modes in {a,a,b,b,b,c,d,d,d} are {a,b,d}.
%e A363131 The prime factorization of 360 is 2*2*2*3*3*5, with non-co-modes {2,3}, so a(360) = 2.

%Y A363131 Positions of terms > 0 are A059404.
%Y A363131 Positions of first appearances appear to converge to A228593.
%Y A363131 For modes instead of non-co-modes we have A362611, triangle A362614.
%Y A363131 For co-modes instead of non-co-modes we have A362613, triangle A362615.
%Y A363131 For parts instead of multiplicities we have A362983.
%Y A363131 For non-modes instead of non-co-modes we have A363127, triangle A363126.
%Y A363131 The triangle for this rank statistic (number of non-co-modes) is A363130.
%Y A363131 A027746 lists prime factors, A112798 indices, A124010 exponents.
%Y A363131 A047966 counts uniform partitions, ranks A072774.
%Y A363131 A363128 counts partitions with more than one non-mode, complement A363129.
