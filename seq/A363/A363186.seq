%N A363186 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers such that the sum of all terms a(1)..a(n) is a substring of the concatenation of all terms a(1)..a(n).
%C A363186 In the first 10000 terms the smallest number that has not yet appeared is 696; it is therefore likely all numbers eventually appear although this is unknown.

%e A363186 a(2) = 10 as a(1) + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11 which is a substring of "1" + "10" = "110".
%e A363186 a(3) = 98 as a(1) + a(2) + 98 = 1 + 10 + 98 = 109 which is a substring of "1" + "10" + "98" = "11098".
%e A363186 a(4) = 767 as a(1) + a(2) + a(3) + 767 = 1 + 10 + 98 + 767 = 876 which is a substring of "1" + "10" + "98" + "767" = "11098767".
