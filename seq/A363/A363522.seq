%N A363522 Number of integers k such that there are exactly n distinct numbers j with k^2 < j < (k+1)^2 which can be expressed as sum of two squares.
%C A363522 Number of occurrences of n in A077773.
%e A363522 a(0) = 1, since A077773(k) = 0 at the single index k = 0.
%e A363522 a(6) = 3, since A077773(k) = 6 for these 3 indices: k = 8, 9, and 11.
%e A363522 a(46) = 0, since A077773 doesn't contain 46; see A363761, A363762 and A363763.
%Y A363522 Cf. A077773, A363761, A363762, A363763.
