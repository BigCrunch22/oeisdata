%N A363636 Indices of numbers of the form k^2+1, k >= 0, that can be written as a product of smaller numbers of that same form.
%C A363636 For the corresponding sequence for numbers of the form k^3+1 instead of k^2+1, the only terms known to me are 0 and 26, with 26^3+1 = (2^3+1)^2*(6^3+1).
%e A363636 0 is a term because 0^2+1 = 1 equals the empty product.
%e A363636 3 is a term because 3^2+1 = 10 = 2*5 = (1^2+1)*(2^2+1).
%e A363636 38 is a term because 38^2+1 = 1445 = 5*17*17 = (2^2+1)*(4^2+1)^2. (This is the first term that requires more than two factors.)
%Y A363636 Sequences that list those terms (or their indices or some other key) of a given sequence that are products of smaller terms of the same sequence (in other words, the nonprimitive terms of the multiplicative closure of the sequence):
