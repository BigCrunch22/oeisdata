%N A363444 a(n) = n for n <= 3; for n > 3, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not yet appeared that includes as factors the distinct prime factors of a(n-2) and a(n-1) that are not shared between a(n-2) and a(n-1).
%C A363444 The last prime to appear in the first 10000 terms is a(17) = 5, and it is unknown if more appear. The largest terms increase rapidly in size, e.g., a(8924) = 2233642178577810, although subsequent terms can be significantly smaller. It is unknown is all numbers eventually appear.

%e A363444 a(4) = 6 as a(2) = 2 and a(3) = 3 contain the distinct prime factors 2 and 3 respectively, both of which only appear in one term. Therefore a(4) is the smallest unused number that contains both 2 and 3 as factors, which is 6.
%e A363444 a(6) = 9 as a(4) = 6 = 2*3 and a(5) = 4 = 2*2, so 3 is the only prime factor that is not shared between these terms. Therefore a(6) is the smallest unused number that contains 3 as a factor, which is 9.
