%N A363492 Numbers k such that the partition number p(k) = A000041(k) can be written as a product of smaller partition numbers.
%C A363492 a(18) > 10000 (if it exists).
%e A363492 0 and 1 are terms, because p(0) = p(1) = 1 is the empty product.
%e A363492 7 is a term, because p(7) = 15 = 3*5 = p(3)*p(4).
%e A363492 39 is a term, because p(39) = 31185 = 3^4*385 = p(3)^4*p(18).
%e A363492 33 is not a term, even though all prime factors of p(33) = 3^2 * 7^2 * 23 appear in smaller partition numbers. (In particular, 33 is a term of A194345.) This is because the only smaller partition number that is divisible by 23 is p(32) = 3 * 11^2 * 23, but p(33) is not divisible by 11.
%Y A363492 Cf. A000041, A034878, A363636.
%Y A363492 Except for a(1) = 0, subsequence of A194345.
