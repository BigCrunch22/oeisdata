%N A363416 a(n) = 1/sqrt(5) * the imaginary  part of Product_{k = 0..n} 1 + k*sqrt(-5).
%C A363416 Compare with A105751(n) = the imaginary part of Product_{k = 0..n} 1 + k*sqrt(-1).
%C A363416 Moll (2012) studied the prime divisors of the terms of A105750 - the real part of Product_{k = 0..n} 1 + k*sqrt(-1) - and divided the primes into three classes. Numerical calculation suggests that a similar division holds in this case.
%C A363416 Type 1: primes p that do not divide any element of the sequence {a(n)}.
%C A363416 We conjecture that in this case, unlike in A105750, the set of type 1 primes is empty; that is, every prime p divides some term of this sequence.
%C A363416 Type 2: primes p such that the p-adic valuation v_p(a(n)) has asymptotically linear behavior. An example is given below.
%C A363416 We conjecture that the set of type 2 primes consists of primes p == 1, 3, 7 or 9 (mod 20), equivalently, rational primes that split in the field extension Q(sqrt(-5)) of Q, together with the prime p = 2. See A139513.
%C A363416 Moll's conjecture 5.5 extends to this sequence and takes the form:
%C A363416 (i) the 2-adic valuation v_2(a(n)) ~ n/4 as n -> oo.
%C A363416 (ii) for the other primes of type 2, the p-adic valuation v_p(a(n)) ~ n/(p - 1) as n -> oo.
%C A363416 Type 3: primes p such that the sequence of p-adic valuations {v_p(a(n)) : n >= 0} exhibits an oscillatory behavior (this phrase is not precisely defined). An example is given below.
%C A363416 We conjecture that the set of type 3 primes consists of primes p == 11, 13, 17 or 19 (mod 20), equivalently, primes that remain inert in the field extension Q(sqrt(-5)) of Q, together with the prime p = 5, which ramifies in Q(sqrt(-5)). See A003626.
