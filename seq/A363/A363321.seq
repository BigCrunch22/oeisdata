%N A363321 Number of fractions of the Farey sequence of order n, F_n, that coincide with those of the sequence of the #{F_n} equally distributed fractions between 0 and 1.
%C A363321 The conjectured formula below suggests that as the value of n increases, the proportion of terms in the Farey sequence F_n that align with the #F_n rationals, evenly distributed between 0 and 1, tends to decrease.

%F A363321 Conjecture: lim_{n->infinity} a(n)/A005728(n) = 0.
%e A363321 For n = 5, we have the Farey sequence F_5 = {0, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 1} with 11 terms, and the corresponding sequence S_5 = {0, 1/10, 1/5, 3/10, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 7/10, 4/5, 9/10, 1} consisting of the 11 equidistant fractions {x/10} with 0 <= x <= 10. Since there are 5 fractions (0, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 1) in the same positions in both sequences, F_5 and S_5, then a(5) = 5.
