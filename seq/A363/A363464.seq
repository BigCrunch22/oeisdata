%N A363464 Numbers k in A052294 with arithmetic derivative k' (A003415) in A052294.
%C A363464 If p > 2 is in A092506 then m = 2*p and u = 4*p are terms. Indeed, if p = 2^k + 1, k >= 1, m = 2*(2^k + 1) = 2^(k+1) + 2^1 has two 1's in its binary expansion, and m' = p+2 = 2^k + 3 = 2^k + 2^1 + 1 has three 1's in its binary expansion. Similarly u = 4*(2^k + 1) = 2^(k+2) + 2^2 and u' = 4*p + 4 = 2^(k+2) + 2^3.
%C A363464 If p is in A057733 then the number m = 2*p is a term. Indeed, if p = 2^k + 3, k >= 1, m = 2*(2^k + 3) = 2^(k+1) + 2^2 + 2 has three 1's in its binary expansion, and m' = p+2 = 2^k + 5 = 2^k + 2^2 + 1 has three 1's in its binary expansion.
%C A363464 If p > 7 is in A057733 then the number m = 4*p is a term. Indeed, if p = 2^k + 3, k >= 3, m = 4*(2^k + 3) = 2^(k+2) + 2^3 + 2 has three 1's in its binary expansion, and m' = 4*(p + 1) = 4*(2^k + 4) = 2^(k+2) + 2^4 has two 1's in its binary expansion.
%C A363464 If p is in A123250 then the number m = 4*p is a term. Indeed, if p = 2^k + 5, k >= 1, m = 4*(2^k + 5) = 2^(k+2) + 2^4 + 2^2 has three 1's its binary expansion, and m' = 4*(p+1) = 4*(2^k + 6) = 2^(k+2) + 2^4 + 2^2 has three 1's in its binary expansion.
%C A363464 If p is in A104070 then the number m = 4*p is a term. Indeed, if p = 2^k + 9, k >= 1, m = 4*(2^k + 9) = 2^(k+2) + 2^5 + 2^2 has three 1's its binary expansion, and m' = 4*(p+1) = 4*(2^k + 10) = 2^(k+2) + 2^5 + 2^3 has three 1's in its binary expansion.
%e A363464 6 = 110_2 has two 1's, 6' = 5 = 101_2 has two 1's, so 6 is a term.
%e A363464 9 = 101_2 has two 1's, 9' = 6 = 110_2 has two 1's, so 9 is a term.
%e A363464 10 = 1010_2 has two 1's, 10' = 7 = 111_2 has three 1's, so 10 is a term.
%e A363464 18 = 10010_2 has two 1's, 18' = 21 = 10101_2 has three 1's, so 18 is a term.
