%N A363504 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not yet appeared that is a multiple of prime(Omega(a(n-1))).
%C A363504 The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers, although it takes many terms for the primes to appear, e.g., a(371221) = 61. After the first two terms the fixed points in the first 500000 terms are 10, 26076, 26151, 26223, 26307, 26379, 26406, although it is possible more exist.
