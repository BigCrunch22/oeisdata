%N A363414 a(n) = (1/2) * the imaginary part of Product_{k = 0..n} 1 + k*sqrt(-4).
%C A363414 Compare with A105751(n) = the imaginary part of Product_{k = 0..n} 1 + k*sqrt(-1).
%C A363414 Moll (2012) studied the prime divisors of the terms of A105750 - the real part of  Product_{k = 0..n} 1 + k*sqrt(-1) - and divided the primes into three classes. Numerical calculation suggests that a similar division holds in this case.
%C A363414 Type 1: primes p that do not divide any element of the sequence {a(n)}.
%C A363414 In this case, unlike in A105750, the set of type 1 primes is conjecturally empty; it appears that every prime p divides some term of this sequence.
%C A363414 Type 2: primes p such that the p-adic valuation v_p(a(n)) has asymptotically linear behavior. An example is given below.
%C A363414 We conjecture that the set of type 2 primes consists of primes p == 1 (mod 4), equivalently, rational primes that split in the field extension Q(sqrt(-1)) of Q. See A002144.
%C A363414 Moll's conjecture 5.5 extends to this sequence: for the primes of type 2, the p-adic valuation v_p(a(n)) ~ n/(p - 1) as n -> oo.
%C A363414 Type 3: primes p such that the sequence of p-adic valuations {v_p(a(n)) : n >= 0} exhibits an oscillatory behavior (this phrase is not precisely defined). An example is given below.
%C A363414 We conjecture that the set of type 3 primes consists of primes p == 3 (mod 4), equivalently, rational primes that remain inert in the field extension Q(sqrt(-1)) of Q, together with the prime p = 2, which ramifies in Q(sqrt(-1)). See A002145.
