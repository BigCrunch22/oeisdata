%N A363413 a(n) = the real part of Product_{k = 0..n} 1 + k*sqrt(-4).
%C A363413 Compare with A105750(n) = the real part of Product_{k = 0..n} 1 + k*sqrt(-1).
%C A363413 Moll (2012) studied the prime divisors of the terms of A105750 and divided the primes into three classes. Numerical calculation suggests that a similar division also holds in this case.
%C A363413 Type 1: primes that do not divide any element of the sequence {a(n)}.
%C A363413 We conjecture that the set of type 1 primes begins {2, 3, 11, 19, 23, 31, 47, 59, 67, 71, 79, ...}.
%C A363413 Type 2: primes p such that the p-adic valuation v_p(a(n)) has asymptotically linear behavior. An example is given below.
%C A363413 We conjecture that the set of type 2 primes consists of primes p == 1 (mod 4), equivalently, rational primes that split in the field extension Q(sqrt(-1)) of Q. See A002144.
%C A363413 Moll's conjecture 5.5 extends to this sequence and takes the form: for primes of type 2, the p-adic valuation v_p(a(n)) ~ n/(p - 1) as n -> oo.
%C A363413 Type 3: primes p such that the sequence of p-adic valuations {v_p(a(n)) : n >= 0} exhibits an oscillatory behavior (this phrase is not precisely defined). An example is given below.
%C A363413 We conjecture that the set of type 3 primes begins {7, 43, 83, 131, 163, 167, ...}.
%C A363413 Taken together, the type 1 and type 3 primes appear to consist of primes p == 3 (mod 4), equivalently, primes that remain inert in the field extension Q(sqrt(-1)) of Q, together with the prime p = 2, which ramifies in Q(sqrt(-1)). See A002145.

%F A363413 a(n) = Sum_{k = 0..floor((n+1)/2)} (-4)^k*Stirling1(n+1,n+1-2*k).
%F A363413 a(n+1)/a(n) = 1 - (2*n + 2)*tan( Sum_{k = 1..n} arctan(2*k) ).
