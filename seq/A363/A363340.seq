%N A363340 a(n) is the smallest positive integer such that a(n) * n is the sum of two squares.
%C A363340 Using Fermat's two-squares theorem it is easy to see that a(n) is the product of all prime factors of n that are congruent to 3 modulo 4 and have an odd exponent.
%F A363340 Multiplicative with a(p^e) = p if p^e == 3 (mod 4), otherwise 1. - _Peter Munn_, Jul 03 2023
%e A363340 a(1) = a(2) = 1 since 1 and 2 are sums of two squares.
%e A363340 a(3) = 3 since 3 and 6 are not sums of two squares but 3*3 is.
%e A363340 a(6) = 3 since 6 and 12 are not sums of two squares but 3*6 = 3^2 + 3^2.
