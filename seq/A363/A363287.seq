%N A363287 Numbers which cannot be written as the sum of 4 distinct proper prime powers (A246547).
%C A363287 A proper prime power is an integer which is at least the 2nd power of a prime, such as 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, as in A246547.
%C A363287 It is likely that all numbers above 162 can be written as the sum of 5 distinct proper prime powers.
%C A363287 a(72)=340473, a(73)=3881313, a(74)=4657401 and a(75) >= 10^9, if it exists.
%e A363287 The smallest integer which can be written as the sum of 4 proper prime powers is 37 = 4+8+9+16 so a(n)=n for n <= 36 and a(37) = 38.
