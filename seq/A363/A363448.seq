%N A363448 Number of noncrossing partitions of the n-set with no pair of singletons {i} and {j} that can be merged into {i,j} and leave the partition a noncrossing partition.
%C A363448 a(n) is the number of maximal sets of noncrossing lanes in a road intersection where U-turns are forbidden and where n entries and n exits are alternated.

%F A363448 a(n) = A000108(n) - A363449(n).
%e A363448 The a(4)=9 noncrossing partitions of the 4-set {1,2,3,4} with no pair of singletons that can be merged (so that we still have a noncrossing partition) are [{1234}], [{12},{34}], [{23},{14}], [{4},{123}], [{3},{124}], [{2},{134}], [{1},{234}], [{13},{2},{4}], [{24},{1},{3}].
