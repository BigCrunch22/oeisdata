%N A363824 a(0) = 0; for n > 0, a(n) is the total number of other numbers, being constructed on a square spiral, that are visible from a(n-1) that equal a(n-1).
%C A363824 A number is visible from any given number if, given that it has coordinates (x,y) relative to that number, the greatest common divisor of |x| and |y| is 1.

%e A363824 a(1) = 0 as a(0) = 0, and there are currently no other numbers that equal 0.
%e A363824 a(2) = 1 as a(1) = 0, and from a(1), at (1,0) relative to the starting square, there is currently one other visible 0, namely a(0).
%e A363824 a(6) = 2 as a(5) = 0, and from a(5), at (-1,0) relative to the starting square, there are currently two other visible 0's, namely a(0) and a(3). Note that a(1) = 0 is not visible as it is hidden by a(0).
