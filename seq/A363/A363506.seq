%N A363506 The number of affine dependencies among the vertices of the n-cube up to symmetry.
%C A363506 a(n) is also the number of circuits of any point configuration combinatorially equivalent to a unit cube in dimension n up to symmetry.

%e A363506 For n = 2, all vertices of the square constitute the only affine dependence.
%e A363506 For n = 3, there is an affine dependence in each boundary square all of which are equivalent; moreover, there is one affine dependence in each square cutting the cube in half all of which are equivalent; the remaining affine dependence with five elements contains a triangle spanned by all neighbors of a point together with that point and the point opposite to it in the 3-cube.
%Y A363506 Cf. A363512 for the total numbers (not up to symmetry). Related to A363505 (and A007847, resp.) by oriented-matroid duality.
