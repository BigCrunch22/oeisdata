%N A363285 a(n) is the smallest multiple k of 2^n such that |sigma(k) - 2*k| = 2^n, where sigma = A000203.
%C A363285 I conjecture that this sequence is infinite.
%C A363285 If 2^n*(2^(j+1) +- 1) - 1 is an odd prime p then k = 2^(n+j)*p is a multiple of 2^n such that |sigma(k) - 2*k| = 2^n. It is not known whether these solutions always include a(n), but this is the case for n = 1..23. - _Andrew Howroyd_, May 26 2023
%F A363285 a(n) = A363249(2^n).
%e A363285 2^3 = 8, and the proper divisors of 56 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 14, 28, which add up to 64, which is 8 more than 56, and since 56 is also divisible by 8 (and since there is no smaller number for which these things are true), a(3) = 56.
%e A363285 2^4 = 16, and the proper divisors of 752 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 47, 94, 188, 376, which add up to 736, which is 16 less than 752, and since 752 is also divisible by 16 (and since there is no smaller number for which these things are true), a(4) = 752.
