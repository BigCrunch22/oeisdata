%N A363296 Unitary weird numbers (A064114) with a record gap to the next unitary weird number.
%C A363296 The record gap values are 3960, 4600, 5040, 5440, 7560, ... .
%C A363296 a(6) > 10^10, if it exists.
%e A363296 70 is in the sequence since it is the first unitary weird number and the next unitary weird number after it is 4030 = 70 + 3960. The next gap which is larger than 3960 is 4600 and it occurs at 5830 which is followed by 10430 = 5830 + 4600.
