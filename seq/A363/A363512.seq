%N A363512 The number of affine dependencies among the vertices of the n-cube.
%C A363512 a(n) is also the number of circuits of any point configuration combinatorially equivalent to a unit cube in dimension n.

%e A363512 For n = 2, there is only one affine dependence among the vertices of the square involving all points.
%e A363512 For n = 3, since there are 6 embeddings of the square into the boundary and 6 embeddings of the square into the interior of the 3-cube, there are 12 affine dependences on squares; moreover, there is an affine dependence for each of the 8 vertices of the 3-cube coming from the intersection of the line from that vertex to the vertex opposite in the 3-cube with the triangle spanned by the neighbors of that vertex; this adds up to a total of 20 affine dependencies.
%Y A363512 Cf. A363506 for the same numbers up to symmetry. Related to A007847 (and A363505, resp.) by oriented-matroid duality.
