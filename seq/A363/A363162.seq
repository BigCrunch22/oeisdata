%N A363162 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not yet appeared that has the same number of distinct prime divisors as a(n-2) + a(n-1).
%C A363162 The terms with different numbers of distinct prime divisors are concentrated along different lines in the graph; see the attached colored image. There are numerous fixed points in the first one million terms, although the last nonprime fixed point is a(n) = 3495. Beyond that there are thirty-one more fixed points all with prime values; it is likely more exist although this is unknown. The sequence is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.

%H A363162 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A363162/a363162.png">Colored image of the first one million terms</a>. The terms with 1,2,3,4,5,6 or 7 distinct prime divisors are colored across the spectrum from red to violet respectively. The white line is a(n) = n.
%e A363162 a(4) = 4 as a(2) + a(3) = 2 + 3 = 5 which has one distinct prime divisor, and 4 is the smallest unused number that has one distinct prime divisor.
%e A363162 a(10) = 12 as a(8) + a(9) = 8 + 10 = 18 which has two distinct prime divisors, and 12 is the smallest unused number that has two distinct prime divisors.
