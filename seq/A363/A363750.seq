%N A363750 Primes p such that p-1 can be written as a product of smaller numbers that are also of the form prime-1.
%C A363750 Except for 2, this is a subsequence of primes of the form 4k+1 (A002144). - _Davide Rotondo_, Oct 07 2024
%e A363750 2 is a term because 2 is prime and 2-1 = 1 equals the empty product.
%e A363750 5 is a term because 5 is prime, 5-1 = 2*2 = (3-1)*(3-1), and 3 is prime.
%e A363750 3329 is a term because 3329 is prime, 3329-1 = 4*16*52 = (5-1)*(17-1)*(53-1), and 5, 17, and 53 are prime. (This is the first term that requires more than two factors.)
