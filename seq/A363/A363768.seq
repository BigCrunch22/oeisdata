%N A363768 The values k such that a regular k-gon with all diagonals drawn contains more 3-sided cells than 4-sided cells.
%C A363768 It is extremely likely that the terms in the data section form the complete list of such k-gons, although this is unknown. If more terms do exist they are greater than 875.
%C A363768 The only known k-gon where the number of 3-sided and 4-sided cells is equal is the 39-gon.
%H A363768 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A363768/a363768.jpg">Image of the 6-gon</a>. This is the first k-gon to contain both 3 and 4 sided cells and where there are more 3-sided cells than 4-sided cells.
%H A363768 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A363768/a363768_1.jpg">Image of the 15-gon</a>. This is the first k-gon that contains more 4-sided cells than 3-sided cells.
%H A363768 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A363768/a363768_2.jpg">Image of the 39-gon</a>. This is the only known k-gon that contains the same number of 3 and 4 sided cells. It is likely to be the only such k-gon.
%e A363768 6 is a term as a regular 6-gon with all diagonals drawn contains 18 3-sided cells and 6 4-sided cells.
%e A363768 144 is a term as a regular 144-gon with all diagonals drawn contains 6363936 3-sided cells and 6270048 4-sided cells. This is likely the last such k-gon.
