%N A363822 a(n) is the conjectured number of stable distinct centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVTs) of a unit disk with n generators (seeds).
%C A363822 Stable CVTs are local minimizers of the CVT function (see Hateley, Wei,and Chen article).
%C A363822 There are other CVTs which are saddle points.
%C A363822 Lloyd's process converges only to stable CVTs from which different with respect to rotation symmetry are selected.
%C A363822 An efficient two-step semi-manual algorithm is used to recognize identical patterns and a fast code for the Lloyd's process.
%C A363822 Code in Mathematica and details published on Github.
