%N A363814 Intersection of A126706 and A055932.
%C A363814 Products m*P(i) of primorials P(i) = A002110(i) such that m | P(i), i > 1, m > 1.

%e A363814 Sequence contains terms k > 1 in {6 * A003586} since all are divisible by P(2) = 6 and by no prime q that does not divide 6. Therefore 12, 18, 24, etc. are in the sequence.
%e A363814 Sequence does not contain k > 1 in {10 * A003592} since such k are divisible by 5 but not 3. Hence, 20, 40, etc. are not in this sequence.
%e A363814 Sequence does not contain k > 1 in {15 * A003593} since such k are odd. Hence, 45, 135, etc. are not in this sequence, etc.
