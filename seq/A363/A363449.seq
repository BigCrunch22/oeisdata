%N A363449 Number of noncrossing partitions of the n-set with some pair of singletons {i} and {j} that can be merged into {i,j} and leave the partition a noncrossing-partition.
%C A363449 a(n) is the number of non-maximal sets of noncrossing lanes in a road intersection where U-turns are forbidden and where n entries and n exits are alternated.
%F A363449 a(n) = A000108(n) - A363448(n).
%e A363449 The 5 noncrossing partitions of the 4-set {1234} with some pair of singletons that can be merged and leave the partition a noncrossing-partition are [{1},{2},{3},{4}], [{12},{3},{4}], [{1},{23},{4}], [{2},{3},{14}], [{1},{2},{34}].
%e A363449 [{1},{23},{4}] can give [{14},{23}].
