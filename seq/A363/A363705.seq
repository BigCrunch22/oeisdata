%N A363705 The minimum irregularity of all maximal 2-degenerate graphs with n vertices.
%C A363705 The irregularity of a graph is the sum of the differences between the degrees over all edges of the graph.
%C A363705 A maximal 2-degenerate graph can be constructed from a 2-clique by iteratively adding a new 2-leaf (vertex of degree 2) adjacent to two existing vertices.
%C A363705 This is also the minimum sigma irregularity of all maximal 2-degenerate graphs with n vertices.  (The sigma irregularity of a graph is the sum of the squares of the differences between the degrees over all edges of the graph.)

%F A363705 a(n) = 8 for n > 6.
%e A363705 For n=3, K_3 has irregularity 0, so a(3) = 0.
%e A363705 For n=4, K_4 minus an edge has irregularity 4, so a(4) = 4.
%e A363705 For n=5, K_4 with a subdivided edge has irregularity 2, so a(5) = 2.
%e A363705 For n>6, add a 2-leaf adjacent to the 2-leaves of the square of a path.  This graph has irregularity 8, so a(n) = 8.
