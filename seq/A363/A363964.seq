%N A363964 Number of unordered pairs of non-intersecting non-self-intersecting paths, singletons included, with nodes that cover all vertices of a convex labeled n-gon.
%C A363964 For each such path there is a sequence of distinct vertices of the n-gon, each (except the last one) connected by a segment with the next vertex in the sequence; the segments have no common internal points. The path itself is the union of the set of these segments and is thus direction-independent: reversing the order of the vertices leads to the same path. If the sequence of vertices has length 1 then there are no segments; we call such a path a singleton.
%F A363964 a(n) = n*(n-1)*(n^2+n+36)*2^(n-8)/3.
%e A363964 a(4)=14 since if one of the paths is a singleton (4 choices), then there are A001792(3)=3 choices for the other path, and otherwise for the two paths there are A308914(4)=2 choices, so a(4)=4*3+2=14.
%Y A363964 Cf. A001792, A308914, A332426, A360716, A360717.
