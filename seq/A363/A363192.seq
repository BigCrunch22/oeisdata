%N A363192 a(n) is the least start of a run of exactly n consecutive powerful numbers (A001694) that are odd, or -1 if no such run exists.
%C A363192 No more terms below 10^18.
%C A363192 At most one of the n odd consecutive powerful numbers in the run is a perfect square. - _David A. Corneth_, May 21 2023
%e A363192 a(1) = 1, since 1 is an odd powerful number, followed by an even powerful number, 4 = 2^2.
%e A363192 a(2) = 25, since 25 = 5^2 and 27 = 3^3 are two consecutive odd powerful numbers, preceded by an even powerful number, 16 = 2^4, and followed by an even powerful number, 32 = 2^5.
