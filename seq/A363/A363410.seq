%N A363410 a(n)= 1/sqrt(2) * the imaginary part of  Product_{k = 1..n} (1 + k*sqrt(-2)).
%C A363410 Compare with A105751(n) = the imaginary part of Product_{k = 0..n} 1 + k*sqrt(-1).
%C A363410 Moll (2012) studied the prime divisors of the terms of A105750 - the real part of Product_{k = 0..n} 1 + k*sqrt(-1) - and divided the primes into three classes. Numerical calculation suggests that a similar division holds in this case.
%C A363410 Type 1: primes p that do not divide any element of the sequence {a(n)}.
%C A363410 We conjecture that in this case, unlike in A105750, the set of type 1 primes is empty; that is, every prime p divides some term of this sequence.
%C A363410 Type 2: primes p such that the p-adic valuation v_p(a(n)) has asymptotically linear behavior. An example is given below.
%C A363410 We conjecture that the set of type 2 primes consists of primes p == 1 or 3 (mod 8), equivalently, rational primes that split in the field extension Q(sqrt(-2)) of Q. See A033200.
%C A363410 Moll's conjecture 5.5 extends to this sequence: for primes p of type 2, the p-adic valuation v_p(a(n)) ~ n/(p - 1) as n -> oo.
%C A363410 Type 3: primes p such that the sequence of p-adic valuations {v_p(a(n)) : n >= 0} exhibits an oscillatory behavior (this phrase is not precisely defined). An example is given below.
%C A363410 We conjecture that the set of type 3 primes consists of primes p == 5 or 7 (mod 8), equivalently, primes that remain inert in the field extension Q(sqrt(-2)) of Q, together with the prime p = 2, which ramifies in Q(sqrt(-2)). See A033203.

%F A363410 (n - 1)*a(n) = (2*n - 1)*a(n-1) - n*(2*n^2 - 4*n + 3)*a(n-2) with a(0) = 0 and a(1) = 1.
%F A363410 a(n) = Sum_{k = 0..floor((n+1)/2)} (-2)^k*Stirling1(n+1,n+1-2*k).
