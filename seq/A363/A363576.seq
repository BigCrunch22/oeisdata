%N A363576 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 6; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not yet appeared such that a(n) has a common factor with a(n-1), has no common factor with a(n-2), while the difference |a(n) - a(n-1)| is distinct from all previous differences |a(i) - a(i-1)|, i=2..n-1.
%C A363576 This is a variation of A360519 where the difference between consecutive terms is distinct. See A360519 for further details.
%C A363576 In the first 100000 terms the only fixed points are 1, 585 and 3619, although it is possible more exist.

%e A363576 a(11) = 28 as 28 shares 2 as a common factor with a(10) = 18 while sharing no common factor with a(9) = 33. Also the difference |28 - 18| = 10 is distinct from all previous differences. This is the first term to differ from A360519.
