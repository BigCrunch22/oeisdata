%N A363554 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the smallest positive integer such that both the gradients and y-intercepts of the lines between any two points (i, a(i)) and (j, a(j)) are distinct.
%C A363554 This is a variation of A286091 where the y-intercepts of all lines are also distinct.

%e A363554 a(12) = 66. A value of 15, with coordinate (12,15), for this term would create a point for which all line gradients are distinct, see A286091, but it creates a line that passes through the origin with a(4), a point with coordinate (4,5). However the terms a(3), at coordinate (3,2) and a(6), at coordinate (6,4), have already created a line that passes through the origin, thus a(12) cannot be 15. The coordinate (12,66) is the first point the leads to all lines and y-intercepts being distinct.
