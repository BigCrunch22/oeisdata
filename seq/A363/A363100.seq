%N A363100 Fractal sequence which is left unchanged by interleaving it with the natural numbers, in such a way that each term k of the sequence is followed by the next k not-yet-seen natural numbers.
%C A363100 a(1) = 1. Each term a(n) = k is followed by the k smallest so-far-unseen natural numbers. Invented by _Eric Angelini_. Another way to say it (Angelini's formulation) is that when subjected to an erasure transformation, the k terms after a(n) = k are deleted, the original sequence is recovered; and if otherwise unconstrained, the natural numbers are introduced as soon as possible.
