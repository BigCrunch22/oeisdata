%N A377524 Number of steps for n to reach the minimum of its final cycle under iterations of the map (A123684): x->(3x-1)/2 if x odd, x/2 otherwise; or -1 if this never happens.
%C A377524 The currently known cycle minimums are 1, 5, 17 and there are no known a(n) = -1 (trajectory never reaches a cycle).
%C A377524 This sequence is one way to extend A006666 (number of Collatz (3x+1)/2 steps) to the negative numbers.
%e A377524 For n = 5, a(5) = 0 because 5 is already the minimum of its "final cycle".
%e A377524 For n = 12, a(12) = 6 because 12 takes 6 iterations to reach the minimum of its "final cycle": 12 -> 6 -> 3 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1.
