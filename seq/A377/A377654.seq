%N A377654 Numbers m^2 for which the center part (containing the diagonal) of its symmetric representation of sigma, SRS(m^2), has width 1 and area m.
%C A377654 Since for numbers m^2 in the sequence the width at the diagonal of SRS(m^2) is 1, the area m of its center part is odd so that this sequence is a proper subsequence of A016754 and since SRS(m^2) has an odd number of parts it is a proper subsequence of A319529. The smallest odd square not in this sequence is 225 = 15^2.  SRS(225) is {113, 177, 113}, its center part has maximum width 2, its width at the diagonal is 1.
%C A377654 The k+1 parts of SRS(p^(2k)), p an odd prime and k >= 0, through the diagonal including the center part have areas (p^(2k-i) + p^i)/2 for 0 <= i <= k. They form a strictly decreasing sequence. Since p^(2k) has 2k+1 divisors and SRS(p^(2k)) has 2k+1 parts, all of width 1 (A357581), the even powers of odd primes form a proper subsequence of A244579. For the subsequence of squares of odd primes p, SRS(p^2) consists of the 3 parts { (p^2 + 1)/2, p, (p^2 + 1)/2 } see A001248, A247687 and A357581.
%C A377654 The areas of the parts of SRS(m^2) need not be in descending order through the diagonal as a(112) = 275^2 = 75625 with SRS(75625) = (37813, 7565, 3443, 1525, 715, 738, 275, 738, 715, 1525, 3443, 7565, 37813) demonstrates.
%C A377654 An equivalent description of the sequence is: The center part of SRS(m^2) has width 1, m is odd, and A249223(m^2, m-1) = 0.
%C A377654 Conjectures (true for all a(n) <= 10^8):
%C A377654 (1) The central part of SRS(a(n)) is the minimum of all parts of SRS(a(n)), 1 <= n.
%C A377654 (2) The terms in this sequence are the squares of the terms in A244579.
%e A377654 The center part of SRS(a(3)) = SRS(25) has area 5, all 3 parts have width 1, and 25 with 3 divisors also belongs to A244579.
%e A377654 The center part of SRS(a(7)) = SRS(169) has area 13, all 3 parts have width 1, and 169 with 3 divisors also belongs to A244579.
%e A377654 The center part of SRS(a(10)) = SRS(441) has area 21 and width 1, but the maximum width of SRS(441) is 2. Number 441 has 9 divisors and SRS(441) has 7 parts while 21 has 4 divisors and SRS(21) has 4 parts so that 21 is in A244579 while 441 is not.
