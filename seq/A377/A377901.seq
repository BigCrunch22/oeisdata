%N A377901 Let Q consist of 1 together with the primes (A008578); form the lexicographically earliest infinite sequence S of distinct positive numbers with the property that a(k) is in Q if and only if k is a term in S.
%C A377901 In the early 20th century, 1 was regarded as a prime (see A008578). The present sequence is therefore a 20th-century analog of A121053. That is, the sequence answers the question "Which terms are in Q?", and is the lexicographically earliest answer. See A121053 for further information.
%C A377901 Like A121053, this is an example of a "Lexicographically Earliest Sequence" for which there is a greedy algorithm: no backtracking is needed.
%C A377901 Theorem. Let p(k) = k-th prime, c(k) = k-th composite number. For n >= 7, if n is a prime or n = c(2*t) for some t, then a(n) = p(k) where k = floor((n+PrimePi(n)-1)/2); otherwise, n = c(2*t-1) for some t and a(n) = c(2*t).

%e A377901 1 is the smallest possible choice for a(1), and 1 is in Q, and it turns out that there is no contradiction in choosing a(1) = 1.
%e A377901 After a(5) = 7, 4 is the smallest number not yet in the sequence, and a(4) = 5 is in Q, so we can try a(6) = 4 (and it turns out that this does not lead to a contradiction later).
