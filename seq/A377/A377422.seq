%N A377422 Numbers that can be expressed as (m + sum of digits of m) in exactly four ways.
%C A377422 Let f(n) = n + (sum of digits of n) = A062028(n).
%C A377422 Let g(m) = number of n such that f(n) = m (i.e. the number of inverses of m), A230093(m).
%C A377422 Numbers m with g(m) = 0 are called the Self or Colombian numbers, A003052.
%C A377422 Numbers m with g(m) = 1 give A225793.
%C A377422 Numbers m with g(m) = 2 give A230094.
%C A377422 Numbers m with g(m) = 3 give A230100.
%C A377422 The present sequence gives numbers m such that A230093(m) = 4.
