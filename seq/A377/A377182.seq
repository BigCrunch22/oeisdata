%N A377182 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive integers such that, for n > 2, a(n) shares a factor with a(n-2) mod a(n-1) while a(n-1) mod a(n) has not previously occurred as the mod value for any consecutive pair of terms.
%C A377182 To ensure the sequence is infinite a(n) must be chosen so that a(n-1) mod a(n) is not 0 or 1. Care must also be taken when choosing a(n) if it is equal to any previously occurring mod value as one is not then guaranteed the next term will exist - in such cases smaller unused mod values must be checked for a valid next term, otherwise the term must be rejected and the next largest candidate trialled.
%C A377182 Surprisingly the first prime to occur is a(94122) = 47857. The next is a(103105) = 26591, and no other primes appear in the first 500000 terms. It is unknown if more occur or why it takes so many terms for a prime to appear. Many small primes, like 5, can never occur as all mod values less than the prime have already appeared. It is conjectured all missing numbers are prime.
%C A377182 In the first 500000 terms the fixed points are 111, 533, 649, 11957; it is unknown if more exist.

%e A377182 a(4) = 6 as a(2) mod a(3) = 3 mod 4 = 3, and 6 is the earliest unused number that shares a factor with 3 while 3 has not occurred as a mod value for any previous pair.
%e A377182 a(9) = 14 as a(7) mod a(8) = 10 mod 12 = 10, and 14 factor with 10. Note that 5 is unused and shares a factor with 10 but a(8) mod 5 = 12 mod 5 = 2, but 2 has previously occurred as the mod value for a(1) mod a(2), so 5 cannot be used. This is the first term to differ from A377078.
