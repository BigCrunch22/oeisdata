%N A377308 All winning positions of Gordon Hamilton's Jumping Frogs game, encoded as even numbers by their prime-factorization exponents.
%C A377308 For the rules of the Jumping Frogs game, see A377232.
%C A377308 Enumerate the primes in order, p_1 = 2, p_2 = 3, etc. Factor any natural number k > 1 as p_1^{x_1}p_2^{x_2}...p_i^{x_i}, where i is as small as possible and each x_j is nonnegative. Then when k is even and x_1, x_2, ..., x_i is a winning position for Jumping Frogs, k occurs as a term. We consider only even numbers to keep the positions distinct; leading zeros can never be used or affect the outcome of Jumping Frogs.
%C A377308 An even number k is a term if and only if A137502(k) is a term. - _Pontus von Br√∂mssen_, Oct 24 2024
%D A377308 See references at A377232.
%e A377308 Consider k = 28. It can be written as 2^2 * 3^0 * 5^0 * 7^1. The jumping frogs position 2, 0, 0, 1 has no legal moves (no occupied place adjacent to the 1 entry and no occupied place 2 places away from the 2 entry). Therefore it is not a winning position, and 28 is not a term.
%e A377308 Conversely, k = 20 can be written as 2^2 * 3^0 * 5^1. The jumping frogs position 2, 0, 1 can be won in a single move to 0, 0, 3 (all frogs in one place). Hence k is a term, namely a(8).
