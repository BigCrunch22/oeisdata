%N A377756 Number of free hexagonal polyominoes with n cells with at most 3 collinear cell centers on any line in the plane.
%C A377756 a(n) is the number of connected planer graphs with n nodes, where the nodes lie on a triangular lattice grid and no more than 3 nodes are collinear over the underlying plane.
%C A377756 a(n) is the sum of columns 1-3 in A378015, the n-th term = Sum(T(n,k)) for k<=3.
