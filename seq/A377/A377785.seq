%N A377785 Number of n-node planar maps with an external face in which all internal faces are triangles.
%C A377785 Maps for a(3) through a(7) are illustrated in Links.
%C A377785 The planar maps considered are connected, unsensed and with no loops or isthmuses. (A loop corresponds to an internal face of size 1 and an isthmus corresponds to an internal face of size 2).
%C A377785 In other words, a(n) is the number of embeddings in the plane of connected bridgeless planar simple graphs with n vertices in which each internal face is a triangle.
