%N A377266 Primes p with the property that there exist nonnegative integers m,n such that m!*n! is congruent to either +1 or -1 mod p^2, with m + n = p - 1.
%C A377266 The generalization of Wilson's Theorem that x!*(p-1-x)! is either +1 or -1 mod p when p is prime is known. This is investigated here for cases of p such that there is an x with x!*(p-1-x)! congruent to either +1 or -1 mod p^2.
%e A377266 0!*4! + 1 = 5^2 and 4+0 = 5-1, so 5 is in the sequence.
%e A377266 1!*9! - 1 = 11^2*2999 and 1+9 = 10-1, so 11 is in the sequence.
%e A377266 0!*12! + 1 = 13^2*2834329 and 0+12 = 13-1, so 13 is in the sequence.
%e A377266 10!*6! + 1 = 17^2*83*108923 and 10+6=17-1, so 17 is in the sequence.
%e A377266 19!*39!-1 is divisible by 59^2 and 19+39=59-1, so 59 is in the sequence.
