%N A377815 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive integers such that the binary concatenation of its terms yields the same string as the binary concatenation of the binary weights of its terms.
%C A377815 The sequence makes huge jumps. For example, here are three consecutive terms: a(70) = 88, a(71) = 2^256-1, a(72) = 97.
%C A377815 Runs of 0 bits induce large terms since z consecutive 0 bits becomes a term with weight at least 2^z and the smallest such is 2^(2^z) - 1.
%C A377815 The base-2 analog of A302656. The first b terms of this sequence's base-b analog are 1,2,...,(b-1), followed by (b^2+b-1).
