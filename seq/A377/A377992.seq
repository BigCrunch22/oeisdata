%N A377992 Irregular triangle giving on row n all antiderivatives of A024451(n), for n >= 2.
%C A377992 Row n lists in ascending order all numbers k whose arithmetic derivative k' [A003415(k)] is equal to A024451(n) = A003415(A002110(n)). For A024451(1) = 1, there is an infinite number of integers k for which A003415(k) = 1 (namely, all the primes), therefore the rows start from index n=2, with each having A377993(n) terms. Note that as a whole, this sequence is not monotonic, for example, the last term on row 9, 1171314743479 is larger than the first term of row 10, 6469693230.
%C A377992 Because A024451 is a subsequence of A048103, this is also. And if all terms of A024451 are squarefree as is conjectured, then all terms of this sequence are cubefree (A004709).

%e A377992 The only terms that occur on row 4 are k = 210, 435, 507 ( = 2*3*5*7, 3*5*29, 3 * 13^2) as they are only numbers for which A003415(k) = 247 = A024451(4) = A003415(A002110(4)), as we have (2*3*5*7)' = (3*5)'*(2*7) + (2*7)'*3*5 = (8*14) + (9*15) = (3*5*29)' = (3*5)'*29 + (3*5)*29' = (8*29 + 15*1) = (3 * 13 * 13)' = (3*13)'*13 + (3*13)*13' = 16*13 + 3*13*1 = 19*13 = 247.
%e A377992  Note that 507 is so far the only known term in this triangle that is not squarefree (in A005117).
