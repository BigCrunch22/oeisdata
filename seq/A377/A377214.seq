%N A377214 Irregular triangle T(n, k), read by rows with 1 <= k <= p = A000040(n), for the very first solution to the transversal of primes problem.
%C A377214 Let p be the n-th prime number. Put 1 to p^2 into a square array in order. Choose a set of primes such that there is one and only one in each row and column. Then T(n, k) gives the first of solutions for the n-th prime according to the size of the selected prime numbers.
