%N A377377 a(n) is the the quotient of the practical number A005153(n) divided by its largest divisor that is primitive practical.
%C A377377 Every practical number > 1 contains at least one primitive practical divisor because they are all even and 2 is primitive practical. Also 1 is primitive practical. If the largest primitive practical factor of the practical number A005153(n) is p then a(n)*p = A005153(n). Whenever a(n) = 1, A005153(n) is also primitive practical.
%e A377377 a(13) = 16 because the practical number A005153(13) = 32 = 2*16 and 2 is its largest primitive practical factor.
%e A377377 a(14) = 6 because the practical number A005153(14) = 36 = 6*6 and 6 is its largest primitive practical factor.
