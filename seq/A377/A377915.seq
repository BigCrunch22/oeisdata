%N A377915 a(n) = m means A342042(n) is the m-th term of A377912.
%C A377915 That is, a(n) = m means A342042(n) = A377912(m).
%C A377915 The reason for looking at this is that A342042 is a permutation of A377912. But not all nonnegative integers appear in either sequence. The present sequence shows the numbers in A342042 in the order in which they appear in A377912. It is a permutation of the natural numbers. A377916 gives the inverse permutation.
