%N A377869 Numbers k such that A276085(k) has no divisors of the form p^p, where A276085 is fully additive with a(p) = p#/p.
%C A377869 Numbers k for which A276085(k) is in A048103, i.e., in the range of A276086.
%C A377869 Numbers k such that A276086(A276085(A276085(k))) is equal to A276085(k).
%C A377869 This is a subsequence of A369003 (numbers k for which A276085(k) is not a multiple of 4), from which it differs for the first time at n=122, where a(122) = 175, as A369003(122) = 174 is not included in this sequence.

%e A377869 A276085(11) = 210 = 2*3*5*7, which has no divisor of the form p^p, therefore 11 is included in this sequence.
%e A377869 A276085(15) = 8 = 2^2 * 2, which has a divisor of the form p^p, therefore 15 is NOT included in this sequence.
%e A377869 A276085(25) = 12 = 2^2 * 3, which has a divisor of the form p^p, therefore 25 is NOT included.
%e A377869 A276085(60) = 10 = 2*5, which has no divisors of the form p^p, therefore 60 is included.
%e A377869 A276085(102) = 30033 = 3^2 * 47 * 71, which has no p^p divisors, therefore 102 is included.
%e A377869 A276085(174) = 223092873 = 3^3 * 3 * 1063 * 2591, which thus has a divisor of the form p^p, and therefore 174 is NOT included in this sequence.
