%N A377316 Orders k of groups G such that G is a non-split extension of Inn(G) by Z(G) for at least one group G of order k.
%C A377316 Inn(G) being the group of inner automorphisms of G and Z(G) the center of G, since Inn(G) = G/Z(G) every group G can be seen as an extension of Inn(G) by Z(G) (considering Inn(G) as a proper group isomorphic to the quotient G/Z(G)). If Inn(G) is isomorphic to a subgroup H of G and the intersection of H and Z(G) is trivial then the extension splits: intuitively this means that G is composed of extension factors that are contained within G itself. If Inn(G) = K and K is not a subgroup of G, or if it is then if the intersection of K and Z(G) is nontrivial, then the extension does not split, meaning that in this particular construction G is composed of a factor K which lies outside of it.
%C A377316 The extension in question is by definition a central extension.
%F A377316 4*m is a term for m > 1. This can be proved by considering the dihedral group D_4m: for every such group Z(D_4m) = C_2 and Inn(D_4m) = D_2m; both are subgroups of D_4m up to isomorphism, however the intersection of D_2m and C_2 is not trivial, and therefore D_4m is a non-split extension of Inn(D_4m) by Z(D_4m).
%e A377316 8 is a term since for the quaternion group Q_8, Inn(Q_8) = C_2 x C_2 and C_2 x C_2 is not a subgroup of Q_8.
%e A377316 27 is a term since for the group (C_3 x C_3) : C_3 (':' denoting the semidirect product) Inn((C_3 x C_3) : C_3) = C_3 x C_3, and although C_3 x C_3 is a subgroup of (C_3 x C_3) : C_3, the intersection of C_3 x C_3 and Z(C_3 x C_3) is not trivial.
