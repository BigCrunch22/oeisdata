%N A377900 After A121053(n) has been found, a(n) is the smallest candidate for A121053(n+1) that has not been eliminated.
%C A377900 [Computed by hand, should be checked]
%e A377900 After a(8) = 9, and A121053(9) = 10 has been determined, the smallest prime not yet used is 17 and the smallest composite not yet used or eliminated is 12 (10 is now eliminated because the terms of A121053 must be distinct), so a(9) = 12.
