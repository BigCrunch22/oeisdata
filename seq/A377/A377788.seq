%N A377788 a(n) is the smallest prime not yet in the sequence such that pi(a(n)) divides the sum a(n) + n, or -1 if no such prime exists.
%C A377788 The defining question is, what is the next term after a(1) = 2, that must be the smallest odd prime not yet used, to which adding that term's index n, that sum is divisible by the index of that fitting prime number, pi(a(n))?
%e A377788 a(2) = 31 because 31 + 2 = 33, and since 31 is the 11th prime, pi(31) = 11, which divides 33, and there is no smaller prime than 31 which satisfies that condition.
%e A377788 a(7) = 89 because 89 + 7 = 96, and since 89 is the 24th prime, pi(89) = 24, which divides 96, and there is no smaller prime than 89 which satisfies that condition.
