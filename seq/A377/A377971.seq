%N A377971 Square array of primes p >= 7, read by decreasing antidiagonals. Each row lists, in increasing order, the primes that share the same sum of their neighboring prime gaps.
%C A377971 First column is subset of A046931, which starts with 3. Here, 3 and 5 are omitted.
%C A377971 The related sum can be denoted Sum_prime_gaps, S = pg_inf + pg_sup.
%F A377971 Sum_prime_gaps_a(n) = S_a(n) = (A002260(n))*2 + 4.

%e A377971 .
%e A377971 31, 59 and 179 are in the same row because their preceding and succeeding prime gaps, (pg_inf, pg_sup), respectively (2,6), (6,2) and (6,2) each equally sum up to 8.
%e A377971 53 and 181 are in the same row because their preceding and succeeding prime gaps, (pg_inf, pg_sup), respectively (6,6) and (2,10) each equally sum up to 12. Here, 53 also happens to be a balanced prime as its corresponding gaps, (6,6), are equal.
