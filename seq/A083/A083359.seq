%N A083359 Visible Factor Numbers, or VFNs: numbers n with the property that every prime factor of n can be found in the decimal expansion of n and every digit of n can be found in a prime factor.
%C A083359 Larger terms can be found with the factorization of 10^m+1. A prime p containing all the prime factors of 10^m+1 will give the VFN (pp), for example 13731373 = 73*137*1373 with 73*137 = 10001. Every prime 9090...9091 builds a VFN with the cofactor 2^5.
%C A083359 Sequence is probably infinite.
%C A083359 The prime p in the 10^m+1 example above must contain exactly m digits. Also, it can contain one of the prime factors wrapped around the end of p. For example, p=11909 contains 11 and 9091, the factors of 100001, with the 9091 wrapping around to the beginning of p. This forms a(44)=1190911909. - _Deron Stewart_, Feb 23 2019
%C A083359 The concatenation must be possible using the prime factors of the number, unlimited multiplicity of the distinct prime factors is not allowed. For example, 71153775 = 3*3*3*5*5*7*11*37*37 can be formed by 7||11||5||37||7||5 but the concatenation requires two 7's and there is only one 7 in the prime factorization, so it is not in the sequence. - _Deron Stewart_, Mar 01 2019
