%N A083854 Numbers that are squares, twice squares, three times squares, or six times squares, i.e., numbers whose squarefree part divides 6.
%C A083854 It is simple to divide equilateral triangles into these numbers of congruent parts: squares by making smaller equilateral triangles; 6*squares by dividing each small equilateral triangle by its medians into small right triangles; and 2*squares or 3*squares by recombining three or two of these small right triangles.

%F A083854 a(n) is bounded below by 0.137918...*n^2 where 0.137918... = 3*(3-2*sqrt(2))*(2-sqrt(3)); the error appears to be O(n).
