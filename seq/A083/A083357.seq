%N A083357 Numbers n such that A083356(n) (the total area of all incongruent integer-sided rectangles of area <= n) is a square.
%C A083357 The reference asks "Let R(n) be the set of all rectangles whose side lengths are natural numbers and whose area is at most n. Find an integer n>1 such that the members of R(n), each used exactly once, tile a square.". It shows that n=43 is the smallest solution. A necessary condition is that n be in this sequence. Is this also a sufficient condition?
%C A083357 A heuristic argument suggests that the sequence is infinite and has about 2*sqrt(log(n)) terms <= n.
%C A083357 No other terms below 10^10.

%e A083357 A083356(43)=2116=46^2, so 43 is in this sequence.
