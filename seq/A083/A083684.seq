%N A083684 Numbers k such that there is no nonnegative integer m such that m < k*prime(k) and the concatenated decimal number fp(k,m) = prime(1).m.prime(2).m. ... .prime(k-1).m.prime(k) is prime.
%C A083684 If k == 1 (mod 3) and 3 divides 2 + 3 + 5 + ... + prime(k) then k
%C A083684 is in the sequence. I conjecture that 3 is the only term of the sequence which is not of this form.
%e A083684 For each m, fp(1,m)=2 is prime so 1 is not in the sequence.
%e A083684 fp(2,2) = 2.2.3 = 223 is prime and 2 < 2*prime(2) so 2 isn't in the sequence. Also for each m, 5 divides fp(3,m) = 2.m.3.m.5 so fp(3,m) is composite and we deduce that 3 is in the sequence.
