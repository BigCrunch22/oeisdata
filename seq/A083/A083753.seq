%N A083753 Smallest palindromic number with exactly n divisors, or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A083753 a(7)=a(11)=a(13)=a(17)=a(19)=a(23)=a(29)=a(31)=a(37)=a(41)=0 under the plausible conjecture that there are no palindromes > 1 which are fifth or higher powers. _David Wasserman_ in A090315 reports that he has checked this (or rather the part needed for this sequence) up to 10^48. - _David Consiglio, Jr._ and _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Mar 27 2012
%C A083753 a(21), a(33), a(35), and a(39) have also not been proved to be zero, but if positive they must be at least 10^31. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Mar 27 2012
