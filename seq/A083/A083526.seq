%N A083526 Composite n such that both n and its reversal in base 10 are squarefree, none of the prime factors of n are palindromes and the prime factors of the reversal of n are the reversals of those of n.
%C A083526 Many trivial terms are obtained if one drops the requirement that none of the prime factors of n be palindromes.
%C A083526 If n is in the sequence, so is its reversal. The smallest palindrome in the sequence is 1226221 = 1021 * 1201.
%C A083526 All terms up to 5000000 have just 2 prime factors and the digits of the prime factors are all 0, 1, 2, or 3. Is this true for all terms?
%e A083526 1469 is the product of two distinct non-palindronomic primes: 1469 = 13 * 113 and reverse(1469) = 9641 has prime factorization 9641 = reverse(13) * reverse(113) = 31 * 311. Hence 1469 belongs to the sequence.
