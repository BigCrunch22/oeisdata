%N A083389 Numbers n such that the number formed by the digits of 2n sorted in descending order is equal to the sum of the divisors of n after the digits of each divisor have been sorted in descending order (all zeros dropped).
%C A083389 Primes with certain digits and various combinations of those digits along with any number of zeros inserted are members. E.g., primes of the form 196(0_z)3, or 3+49*2^(n+2)*5^n for n>1, etc. are in this sequence.
%e A083389 a(2)=163 because the digits of 2*163 sorted descending are 632; the divisors of 163 are [1, 163] and 1+631 = 632.
