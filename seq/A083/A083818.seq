%N A083818 Numbers n such that 2n-1 is the digit reversal of n.
%C A083818 a(n) = 1 + 36 + 360 + 3600 + 36000 + ..., for a total of n terms. a(n) = 1 + sum of first n-1 terms of the geometric progression with first term 36 and common ratio 10. a(n) = 1 + 36*A000042(n-1) (the unary sequence).
%H A083818 <a href="/index/Rec#order_02">Index entries for linear recurrences with constant coefficients</a>, signature (11,-10).
%F A083818 a(n) = 4*10^(n-1) - 3.
%e A083818 2*37 - 1 = 73.
