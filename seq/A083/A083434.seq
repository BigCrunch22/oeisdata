%N A083434 a(n) = smallest palindrome not included earlier and with the same prime signature as n, or 0 if no such palindrome exists.
%C A083434 Conjecture: There are infinitely many zeros in this sequence.
%C A083434 a(32) = 0 is only a conjecture. If there is a palindromic 5th power, it is greater than 10^40. - _David Wasserman_, Mar 22 2005
%e A083434 16 = 2^4 which has the prime signature p^4, p a prime; hence a(16) = 14641= 11^4 has the prime signature p^4.
%e A083434 a(30) = 66 as 66 and 30 have same prime signature.
%e A083434 a(18) = 99, as 44 with the same prime signature is already included as a(12)=44.
