%N A083984 If k is a number with exactly two distinct decimal digits, say a and b, neither of which is 0 (i.e., a member of A101594), define the self-complement of k, SC(k), to be the number obtained by replacing a with b and vice versa. E.g. SC(232233) = 323322. Sequence contains numbers n such that n and SC(n) are relatively prime.
%e A083984 25 is a member as 25 and 52 are relatively prime, but 24 is not a member as 24 and 42 are not coprime.
