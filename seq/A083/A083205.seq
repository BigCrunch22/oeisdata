%N A083205 a(1) = 1, then smallest number not included earlier such that a(n)*a(n+1) + 1 is an n-th power.
%C A083205 The sequence is infinite and a(n+1) <= ([a(n)+1]^n - 1)/a(n) when n is even, or a(n+1) <= ([a(n)-1]^n - 1)/a(n) when n is odd.
%C A083205 To find a(6), we need an x such that x^5 = 1 (mod a(5)); then a(6) = (x^5 - 1)/a(5). The multiplicative group mod a(5) has order phi(a(5)) = 23296, which is not divisible by 5. So the only 5th root of 1 in this group is 1. x = 1 would give a(6) = 0, this is not allowed, so we take x to be the next representative of 1 mod a(5), i.e. a(5)+1. So a(6) = [(a(5)+1)^5 - 1]/a(5). - _David Wasserman_, Mar 02 2004
