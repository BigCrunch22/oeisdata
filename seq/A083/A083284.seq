%N A083284 Numbers m such that m and m+2 are both brilliant numbers, where brilliant numbers are semiprimes whose prime factors have an equal number of decimal digits, or whose prime factors are equal.
%C A083284 The only consecutive brilliant numbers are {9, 10} and {14, 15}; and for m > 14 there are no brilliant constellations of the form {m, m+(2k+1)} or equivalently {n, 2k+m+1} with k >= 0. Proof: One of m and 2k+m+1 will be even. And there are no even brilliant numbers > 14 since they must have the form 2*p where p is a prime having only one digit.
