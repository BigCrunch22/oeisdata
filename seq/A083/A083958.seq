%N A083958 Smallest multiple of n using all digits of (n-1) at least once and no others; or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A083958 If n contains all odd digits then a(n+1) = 0. If n+1 is not divisible by 5 and n contains an even digit then a(n+1) is nonzero. Infinitely many triples of successive zeros are there.
%C A083958 It's not clear whether or not a digit that occurs twice in n-1 is required to occur twice in a(n). The first time it matters is a(101), which is either 101 or 1010. - _David Wasserman_, Dec 03 2004
