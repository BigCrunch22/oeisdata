%N A083698 Partial quotients of the continued fraction which has convergents with the least possible prime denominators (A072999).
%C A083698 Equivalently: a(1) = 2 and for n >= 2, a(n) is the least integer such that the numerator of the continued fraction [a(1),a(2),...,a(n)] is prime.
%C A083698 These prime numerators, listed in A072999, are the same as the prime denominators in the definition of this sequence A083698. The equivalence comes from the fact that 1/[a1, ..., aN] = [0, a1, ..., aN] for any continued fraction [a1, ..., aN] with a1 != 0. That is, numerators and denominators of the convergents are exchanged when considering the continued fraction with/without integer part, which amounts to inserting or deleting a leading 0.
%F A083698 a(0) = 0, a(1) = 2, a(n) = floor(A072999(n)/A072999(n-1)) for n > 1. By definition, when n > 2, a(n) = (A072999(n)-A072999(n-2))/A072999(n-1) exactly.
%e A083698 The partial quotients of the continued fraction 2 + 1/(1 + 1/(1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(4 + ...))))) are by definition the coefficients [2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, ...]. The convergents of this continued fraction are:
%e A083698 2 = 3/1, 2 + 1/1 = 3 = 3/1, 2 + 1/(1 + 1/1) = 2 + 1/2 = 5/2, ...
%e A083698 Here the primes listed in A072999 appear as numerators (cf. equivalent definition in comments). These primes appear as denominators if the terms [2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, ...] are considered as coefficients that appear in the pure fraction 1/(a(1) + 1/(a(2) + 1/...))), with convergents: 1/2, 1/(2 + 1/1) = 1/3, 1/(5/2) = 2/5, etc.
%e A083698 This amounts to including the initial a(0) = 0 for the integer part, which "shifts down into the denominator" the coefficients (2, 1, 1, ...) of the earlier mentioned continued fraction 2 + 1/(...).
