%N A083269 a(n) = pi(A052180(n)) = A000720(A052180(n)); subscript of last prime used in Eratosthenes sieve by which all composites between n-th and (n+1)th primes were excluded.
%e A083269 Of composites between the 24th and 25th primes (89, 97), the least prime divisors are {2,7,2,3,2,5,2}.
%e A083269 The largest of these is 7. This means that pi(7)=4 steps in prime sieving are required to sweep out all composites between 89 and 97: {90,92,94,96}, {93}, {95}, and {91} were excluded in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th steps, respectively.
%e A083269 So a(24)=4.
