%N A083660 Smallest nonnegative integer m such that the concatenation of the integers from n to 1 interspersed with those of m, in base 10, is prime.
%C A083660 Firoozbakht's conjecture: there exists an a(n) for every n greater than 1 and it is less than n^2.
%C A083660 For n with one digit, the searched-for prime must have at least 2n - 1 digits in base 10.
%C A083660 Firoozbakht's conjecture holds true up to at least 100. With adequately coded commands, verification should not take longer than a minute. - _Alonso del Arte_, Dec 09 2009

%e A083660 a(4) = 14 because the concatenation of the digits from 4 to 1 (that is, 4321) with 14 stuck between each of them is 4143142141, and that is a prime number. Similar concatenations with numbers less than 14 used in 14's place all give composite numbers.
