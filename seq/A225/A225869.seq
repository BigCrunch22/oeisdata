%N A225869 Limiting sequence of a counting procedure.
%C A225869 Suppose that S = (x(1),..,x(h)) is a vector of nonnegative integers.  Let m = max(S) and F(S) = (f(0),..,f(m)), where f(i) is the number of occurrences of i in S.  Define F(0) = S and F(q) = F(F(q-1)) for q>=1.  By Theorem 1 at A225660, the vector F(q) is eventually periodic with period 6.
%C A225869 Theorem 2.  If S is not one of the ten vectors listed below, then F(q) = (2, 2) for some q, and the concatenation of F(q), F(q+1),... comprises the periodic sequence A225869.  Seven of the exceptional vectors are indicated by (0) -> (1) -> (0,1) -> (1,1) -> (1,0,1) -> (1,2) -> (0,1,1) -> (1,2) -> ..., and the remaining three, by (2) -> (0,0,1) -> (2,1) -> (0,1,1).  (The second appearances of (1,2) and (0,1,1) are not counted.)
%C A225869 A proof of Theorem 2 consists of easy (omitted) examinations of cases.  Note, in particular, that A225869 is the limiting sequence for every S having more than 3 components.
