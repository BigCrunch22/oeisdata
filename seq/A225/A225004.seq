%N A225004 a(n) is the largest multiple of n with fewer than twice as many divisors as n.
%C A225004 Conjecture: a(n) is always a divisor of n^2.
%e A225004 a(6) = 18 because 6 has 4 divisors and term must have fewer than 8 divisors. Only 6, 12, and 18 are multiples of 6 with fewer than 8 divisors.
