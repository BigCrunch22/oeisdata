%N A225594 Least splitter of s(n) and s(n+1), where s(n) = (1 + n)^(1/n).
%C A225594 Suppose that x < y.  The least splitter of x and y is introduced at A227631 as the least positive integer d such that x <= c/d < y for some integer c; the number c/d is called the least splitting rational of x and y.  Since s(n) -> e, the least splitting rationals -> e.
