%N A225951 Triangle for perimeters of primitive Pythagorean triangles.
%C A225951 See the Hardy-Wright (Theorem 225, p. 190) and Niven-Zuckerman-Montgomery (Theorem 5.5, p. 232) references for primitive Pythagorean triangles.
%C A225951 Here a(n,m) = 0 for non-primitive Pythagorean triangles.
%C A225951 There is a one-to-one correspondence between the values n and m of this number triangle for which a(n,m) does not vanish and primitive solutions of x^2 + y^2 = z^2 with y even, namely x = n^2 - m^2, y = 2*n*m and z = n^2 + m^2. The mirror triangles with x even are not considered here. Therefore a(n,m) = (n^2 - m^2) + 2*n*m + (n^2 + m^2) = 2*n*(n+m) (for these solutions).
%C A225951 The number of non-vanishing entries in row n is A055034(n).
%C A225951 The sequence of the diagonal entries is 2*n*(2*n-1) = 2*A000384(n), n >= 2.
%C A225951 The ordered nonzero entries of this triangle gives A024364.
%C A225951   Note that all perimeters <= N will certainly be found if one consider all rows n = 2, 3, ..., floor((-1 + sqrt(2*N + 1))/2).
%C A225951 See also A070109(n) for the number of primitive Pythagorean triangles with perimeter n and leg y even.

%F A225951 a(n,m) = 2*n*(n+m) if n > m >= 1, gcd(n,m) = 1, and n and m are integers of opposite parity (i.e., (-1)^{n+m} = -1), otherwise a(n,m) = 0.

%e A225951 The primitive triangle for (n,m) = (2,1) is (x,y,z) = (3,4,5), therefore, a(2,1) = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12.
%e A225951 The primitive triangle for (n,m) = (7,4) is (x,y,z) = (33,56,65), therefore, a(7,4) = 33 + 56 + 65 = 154.
