%N A225488 Murai Chuzen numbers.
%C A225488 "Murai Chuzen divides 9 by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, getting the figures 9, 45, 3, 225, 18, 15, x (not divisible), 1125, 1, -- without reference to the decimal points. Similarly he divides 99 by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, getting the figures 99, 495, 33, 2475, 198, 165, x, 12375, 11. Next he divides 999 by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, getting the figures 999, 4995, 333, 24975, 1998, 1665, x, 124875, 111." (Smith and Mikami, expanded and corrected)
%C A225488 Smith and Mikami put "x" whenever a decimal does not terminate. In the data, I put -1 instead of "x".
%C A225488 Murai Chuzen concludes that if 1 is divided by 9, 45, 3, 225, 18, 15, 1125, and 1, the results will have one-digit repetends; if 1 is divided by 99, 495, 33, 2475, 198, 165, 12375, and 11, the results will have two-digit repetends; if 1 is divided by 999, 4995, 333, 24975, 1998, 1665, 124875, and 111, the results will have three-digit repetends; etc.

%e A225488 9/1 = 9, so a(1) = 9; 9/2 = 4.5, so a(2) = 45; 9/7 does not terminate, so a(7) = -1; 9/8 = 1.125, so a(8) = 1125; 9/9 = 1, so a(9) = 1.
%e A225488 99/1 = 99, so a(10) = 99; 99/2 = 49.5, so a(11) = 495.
