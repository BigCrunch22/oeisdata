%N A225332 A continuous "look-and-repeat" sequence (seed 2).
%C A225332 The 'look-and-repeat' sequence A225330, with seed 2. The variant A225331 with the same seed 2 gives this same sequence.
%C A225332 It describes at each step the preceding digits by repeating the frequency number.
%C A225332 The sequence is determined by triples of digits. The first two terms of a triple are the repeated count and the last term is the digit.
%C A225332 a(n) is always equal to 1, 2, 3, or 5. No series of four identical digits happens in the sequence, nor any of five 5's.
%C A225332 Applying the look-and-repeat principle to the sequence itself, it is simply shift one rank to the left.
%e A225332 a(1) = 2, you then see "one 2" and repeating "one", a(2) = a(3) = 1 (one) and a(4) = 2; you have then two 1's, so 2, 2, 1; then three 2, so 3, 3, 1, etc.
%Y A225332 Cf. A225330, A225331 (two variants with seed 1), A225329 (look-and-repeat by block), A005150 (original look-and-say), A225224, A221646, A225212 (continuous look-and-say versions).
