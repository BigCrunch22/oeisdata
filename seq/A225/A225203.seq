%N A225203 Table T(n,k) composed of rows equal to: n * (the characteristic function of the multiples of (n+1)), read by downwards antidiagonals.
%C A225203 Column k =1 of the table is the integers, from n=1 in row 1.
%C A225203 The n-th row of the table is a repeating pattern, starting with the value of n followed by n instances of zero, as created by the characteristic function of the multiples of (n+1).
%C A225203 Sums of the antidiagonals produce A065608.
%C A225203 Row 1 is A059841, row 2 = 2*A079978, row 3 = 3*A121262, row 4 = 4*A079998, row 5 = 5*A079979, row 6 = 6*A082784, row 7 = 7*|A014025|. - _Boris Putievskiy_, May 08 2013
%F A225203 From _Boris Putievskiy_, May 08 2013: (Start)
%F A225203 As table T(n,k) = n*(floor((n+k)/(n+1))-floor((n+k-1)/(n+1))).
%F A225203 As linear sequence a(n) = A002260(n)*(floor(A003057(n))/(A002260(n)+1)-floor(A002024(n))/(A002260(n)+1)); a(n) = i*(floor((t+2)/(i+1))-floor((t+1)/(i+1))), where i=n-t*(t+1)/2, t=floor((-1+sqrt(8*n-7))/2). (End)
