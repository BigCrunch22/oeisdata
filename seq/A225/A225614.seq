%N A225614 The smallest n-digit number whose first k digits are divisible by the k-th prime for k = 1..n.
%C A225614 There are 10 terms in the series and the 10-digit number 6300846559 is the last number to satisfy the requirements.
%e A225614 There are four one-digit numbers divisible by the first prime (2) and the smallest is 2, so a(1)=2.
%e A225614 For two-digit numbers, the second digit must make it divisible by 3, which gives 21 as smallest to satisfy the requirement, so a(2)=21.
