%N A225544 a(n) begins the earliest chain of exactly n distinct primes such that any term in the chain equals the previous term increased by the product of its digits.
%C A225544 A chain ends either at a composite number, or at a prime which contains a zero, since the subsequent primes in the chain are identical.
%e A225544 23 starts the earliest chain of length 3, since 23+2*3 = 29, 29+2*9 = 47 and 47+4*7 = 75, where the first 3 terms are distinct and prime, so a(3) = 23. The last distinct term in the chain starting at 1725121513 is the prime 1725980623 which contains a zero and thus generates itself.
