%N A225179 a(n) = min{2 + c_n + 2(c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_(n-1)) | n = p + q, 1 <= p < q < n, gcd(p, q) = 1, and p/q has continued fraction expansion [0; c_1, c_2, ...., c_n]}.
%C A225179 It is conjectured that a(n) = min{ B(w) | w is unbordered and length(w) = n }, where B(w) is the number of distinct unbordered factors in w.
%C A225179 If this conjecture were to be proved, we could use this is the definition, and put the present definition into the FORMULA field. It is known to be true for n <= 20.
%C A225179 [A word v is bordered if there is a nonempty word u different from v which is both a prefix and a suffix of v (see, for example, Allouche and Shallit).]
