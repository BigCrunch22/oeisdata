%N A225425 Number of "abc-hits" with c < 10^n.
%C A225425 Let rad(x) be the function that computes the squarefree kernel of x (see A007947). A triple {a,b,c} of positive integers with a+b=c, gcd(a,b)=1 and c > rad(a*b*c) is called an abc-hit.
%C A225425 The first 6 terms were computed using A130510. More terms were found on the Wikipedia page.

%e A225425 The only solution under 10 is 1 + 8 = 9.
%Y A225425 Cf. A130510, A130511, A130512 (c, a, and rad(a*b*c)).
%Y A225425 Cf. A225426 (a,b,c in one sequence).
