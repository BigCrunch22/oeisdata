%C A225579 These numbers play a role in the American drama television series "Touch" that ran on Fox from January 25, 2012, to May 10, 2013 with 11 episodes in season 1 and 13 episodes in season 2. The plot involves a 11-year-old autistic child, Jake, who successively finds the numbers, and a child doctor, Professor Arthur Teller. According to the Wikipedia, "The sequence of numbers that Jake presents falls into what Teller claimed was the Amelia Sequence (later known as the God Sequence), based on Amelia Robbins, who was one of his former child patients."
