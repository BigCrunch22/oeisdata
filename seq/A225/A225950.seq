%N A225950 Triangle for odd legs of primitive Pythagorean triangles.
%C A225950 For primitive Pythagorean triples (x,y,z) see the Niven et al. reference, Theorem 5.5, p. 232, and the Hardy-Wright reference, Theorem 225, p. 190.
%C A225950 Here a(n,m) = 0 for non-primitive Pythagorean triangles.
%C A225950 There is a one-to-one correspondence between the values n and m of this number triangle for which a(n,m) does not vanish and primitive solutions of x^2 + y^2 = z^2 with y even, namely x = n^2 - m^2, y = 2*n*m and z = n^2 + m^2. The mirror triangles with x even are not considered here. Therefore a(n,m) = n^2 - m^2 (for these solutions).
%C A225950 The number of non-vanishing entries in row n is A055034(n).
%C A225950 The sequence of the main diagonal is 2*n -1 = A005408(n-1),
%C A225950    n >= 2.
%C A225950 If the zeros are eliminated and the numbers are sorted nondecreasingly (multiple entries appear) one obtains A120890. All odd numbers >= 3 appear, they are given in A005408. Note that all odd legs x will be found if one takes in the triangle n = 2, ..., floor((x+1)/2).

%F A225950 a(n,m) = n^2 - m^2 if n > m >= 1, gcd(n,m) = 1, and n and m are integers of opposite parity (i.e., (-1)^{n+m} = -1), otherwise a(n,m) = 0.

%e A225950 a(6,1) = 35 from the primitive triangle (35,12,37).
%e A225950 a(6,2) = 0 because n and m are even (not allowed n, m values for primitive triangles).
%e A225950 a(6,3) = 0 because gcd(6,3) = 3 (not 1, hence not allowed).
