%N A225334 Look-and-repeat: similar to look-and-say except frequency is repeated (seed 3).
%C A225334 Look-and-repeat sequence A225329 with seed 3.
%C A225334 Contains 1, 2, 3 and 5, but not 4.
%C A225334 All terms end with 3 (the seed) and, starting at the fourth, with 3331113, which makes the 5 appear.
%C A225334 All terms except the second begin with 2 or 3; it is a direct consequence of the look-and-repeat rule.
%C A225334 Sequence A225333, the look-and-repeat sequence with seed 2 is almost the same, differing only in the last digit of each term (2 instead of 3 here). Indeed, any one-digit seed except 1 leads to essentially the same sequence with all terms identical except the last one = the seed.
%F A225334 a(n) = A225333(n) + 1.
%e A225334 The term after 113 is obtained by saying (repeating) two two 1, one one 3, which gives 221113.
%Y A225334 Cf. A225329 (seed one), A225333 (seed two), A225332 (continuous look-and-repeat, seed 2), A225330, A225331 (continuous look-and-repeat, seed 1).
%Y A225334 Cf. A005150 (original look-and-say), A225224, A221646, A225212 (continuous look-and-say versions).
