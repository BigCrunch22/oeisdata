%N A225576 Numbers n such that n^2 = prime(i)*prime(i+3) + prime(j)^2, for some i, j > 0, and such that prime(i+3) = prime(i) + 2*prime(j).
%C A225576 In all solutions of this equation n is divisible by 6.
%C A225576 The solution values for n = prime(i) + prime (j), when restricted by the condition prime(i+3) = prime (i) + 2*prime(j). Rather than being overly restrictive, the condition applies to the most prevalent type of solution to the equation above for n^2. See A225461 for details.
%C A225576 The equation is member of an infinite family of similar equations written as:  n^2 = prime(i)*prime(i+d) + prime(j)^2, for any i,j, or d > 0.  In this instance d = 3.
%C A225576 There are some additional solutions for n that do NOT obey the condition above. These are sparse but include:  60 (a 2nd time), 150, 1434, 4584 and 5190 all of which occur at low values of prime(i) and which obey the condition:  n = prime(j) + 1.  These are also divisible by 6, but they are excluded from the listing above.

%e A225576 12 is a solution value for N because 12^2 = 7*17 + 5^2 and 17 is the third prime after 7.
