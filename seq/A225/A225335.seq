%U A225335 1,1,2,2
%N A225335 A continuous "look-and-repeat" sequence (seed 3).
%C A225335 The 'look-and-repeat' sequence A225330, with seed 3. The variant A225331 with the same seed 3 gives this same sequence.
%C A225335 It describes at each step the preceding digits by repeating the frequency number.
%C A225335 The sequence is determined by triples of digits. The first two terms of a triple are the repeated frequency and the last term is the digit.
%C A225335 a(n) is always equal to 1, 2, 3, or 5. No series of four identical digits happens in the sequence, nor any of five 5's.
%C A225335 Applying the look-and-repeat principle to the sequence itself, it is simply shift one rank to the left.
%e A225335 a(1) = 3, you then see "one 3" and repeating "one", a(2) = a(3) = 1 (one) and a(4) = 3; you have then two 1's, so 2,2,1 ; then one 3, so 1,1,3, etc.
%Y A225335 Cf. A225330, A225331 (two variants with seed 1), A225331 (seed 2), A225329, A225333, A225334 (look-and-repeat by block with resp. seed 1, seed 2, seed 3).
%Y A225335 Cf. A005150 (original look-and-say), A225224, A221646, A225212 (continuous look-and-say versions).
