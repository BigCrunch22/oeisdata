%N A225613 The largest n-digit number whose first k digits are divisible by the k-th prime for k = 1..n.
%C A225613 There are 10 terms in the series; the 10-digit number 8757193191 is the largest number to satisfy the requirements.
%e A225613 There are four one-digit numbers divisible by the first prime (2) and the largest is 8, so a(1)=8.
%e A225613 For two-digit numbers, the second digit must make it divisible by 3, which gives 87 as the largest to satisfy the requirement, so a(2)=87.
