%N A225973 Number of union-closed partitions of weight n.
%C A225973 The objects being counted are sets of sets of positive integers; each such set is closed under set union, and the sum of all the elements of its elements is n.
%C A225973 The sequence is related to Frankl's notorious union-closed sets conjecture, see the Wikipedia link.
%D A225973 This sequence was proposed by David S. Newman, in a note to the SeqFan mailing list, dated May 19 2013.

%e A225973 For n = 5, the a(5) = 5 union-closed partitions are: {{5}}, {{4,1}}, {{3,2}}, {{3,1},{1}}, {{2,1},{2}}.
%e A225973 {{3},{2}} has the correct sum, but is not closed under union.
%Y A225973 Cf. A050342 (answers a similar question without the requirement that the sets be closed under union).
