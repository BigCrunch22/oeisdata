%N A225378 Construct sequences P,Q,R by the rules: Q = first differences of P, R = second differences of P, P starts with 1,5,11, Q starts with 4,6, R starts with 2; at each stage the smallest number not yet present in P,Q,R is appended to R; every number appears exactly once in the union of P,Q,R. Sequence gives R.
%C A225378 P can be extended for 10^6 terms, but it is not known if P,Q,R can be extended to infinity.
%C A225378 A probabilistic argument suggests that P, Q, R are infinite. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 19 2013
