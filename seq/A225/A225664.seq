%N A225664 Number of nonrepeating vectors in a counting procedure that starts with the digits of (n base 10).
%C A225664 The counting procedure and "eventually period 6 theorem" are introduced at A225660.  Conjecture:  if a(n) is odd for only finitely many n.

%e A225664 To see that a(14) = 4, write 14 -> 01011 -> 32 -> 0011-> 22 -> 002 -> 201 -> 111 -> 03 -> 1001 -> 22.  This shows that the 4 nonrepeating vectors are (1,4), (0,1,0,1,1), (3,2), and (0,0,1,1).  After (0,0,1,1) the cycle (2,2) -> ... -> (2,2) has length 6, so that the remainder of the sequence of vectors is periodic with period 6.
