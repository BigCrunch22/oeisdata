%N A225489 Elimination order for the first person in a linear Josephus problem.
%C A225489 The process is identical to that of A090569 where n persons are arranged on a line and every second person is eliminated. When we reach the end of the line the direction is reversed without double-counting the person at the end. a(n) is the order in which the person originally first in line is eliminated.

%F A225489 For n=4m then a(n) = 3*n/4;
%F A225489 for n=4m+1 then a(n) = a(1+(n-1)/4) + 3*(n-1)/4;
%F A225489 for n=4m+2 then a(n) = a(1+(n-2)/4) + 3*(n-2)/4 + 1;
%F A225489 for n=4m+3 then a(n) = 3*(n-3)/4 + 2.
%e A225489 If there are 7 persons to begin with, they are eliminated in the following order: 2,4,6,5,1,7,3. So the first person (the person originally first in line) is eliminated as number 5. Therefore a(7) = 5.
