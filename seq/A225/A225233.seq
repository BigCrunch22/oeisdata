%N A225233 Triangle read by rows: T(n, k) = (2*n + 2 - k)*k, for 0 <= k <= n.
%C A225233 The entries of a row n appear on the diagonal of a square array of dimension n + 1 while filling it with numbers from 0 to n^2 - 1 first along top row and left column, then along 2nd row and 2nd column, 3rd row and 3rd column etc. up to the (single) entry in the n-th row and n-th column. [This may be the preferred order if a set of matrices M is built with requirements on the product M*M.] This vaguely is an alternative to the boustrophedonic re-arrangement of a finite array.
%C A225233 The triangle may also be generated by reading half of each second antidiagonal of the array A003991.
%C A225233 The numbers appear in reverse order as the numerators in the triangle A061035 before they are reduced with the denominators by cancellation of common factors. - _Paul Curtz_, May 03 2013
