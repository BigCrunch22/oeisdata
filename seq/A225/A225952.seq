%N A225952 Triangle read by rows, giving the even legs of primitive Pythagorean triangles, with zero entries for non-primitive triangles.
%C A225952 For primitive Pythagorean triples (x,y,z) see the Niven et al. reference, Theorem 5.5, p. 232, and the Hardy-Wright reference, Theorem 225, p. 190.
%C A225952 There is a one-to-one correspondence between the values n and m of this number triangle for which a(n,m) does not vanish and primitive solutions of x^2 + y^2 = z^2 with y even, namely x = n^2 - m^2, y = 2*n*m and z = n^2 + m^2. The mirror triangles with x even are not considered here. Therefore a(n,m) = 2*n*m (for these solutions). The number of non-vanishing entries in row n is A055034(n).
%C A225952 The sequence of the main diagonal is 2*n*(n-1) = 4*A000217 (n-1), n >= 2.
%C A225952 If the 0 entries are eliminated and the numbers are ordered nondecreasingly (multiple entries appear) the sequence becomes A120427. All its entries are positive integer multiples of 4, shown in  A008586(n), n >= 1. Note that all even legs <= N are certainly reached if one considers in the triangle rows n = 2, ..., floor(N/2).

%F A225952 a(n,m) = 2*n*m if n > m >= 1, gcd(n,m) = 1, and n and m are integers of opposite parity (i.e., (-1)^{n+m} = -1), otherwise a(n,m) = 0.
