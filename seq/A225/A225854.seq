%N A225854 Frequency of prime numbers between consecutive partial sums of primes.
%C A225854 Gives the numbers of primes between adjacent numbers in the sequence A014284, that is, primes in the half-open interval [A014284(k), A014284(k+1)).
%C A225854 The plot of this sequence follows a linear curve.
%H A225854 Giovanni Resta, <a href="/A225854/b225854.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..10000</a>
%e A225854 List the numbers with an increment of 1 beginning at n=1, and stop when the number of numbers reaches a prime, in this case the list would be {1,2} since its size is 2. Find the number of primes in that interval and add it to the sequence. In this case, there is 1 prime in the list. Continue counting from the last number in the previous list and apply the same rules, the next list will be {3,4,5} of size 3 and contains 2 prime numbers. The list after that will be {6,7,8,9,10} of size 5 and contains 1 prime number.
