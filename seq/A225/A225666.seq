%N A225666 Number of nonrepeating vectors in a counting procedure that starts with the digits of n!.
%C A225666 The counting procedure and "eventually period 6 theorem" are introduced at A225660.
%H A225666 Clark Kimberling, <a href="/A225666/b225666.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..299</a>
%e A225666 To see that a(3) = 10, write 3! = 6 -> 0000001 -> 61 -> 0100001-> 52 -> 001001 -> 42 -> 00101 -> 32 -> 0011 -> 22 -> 001 -> 201 -> 111 -> 03 -> 1001 -> 22.  This shows that the 10 nonrepeating vectors are (6), (0,0,0,0,0,0,1), (6,1), ... ,and (0,0,1,1).  After (0,0,1,1) the cycle (2,2) -> ... -> (2,2) has length 6, so that the remainder of the sequence of vectors is periodic with period 6.
