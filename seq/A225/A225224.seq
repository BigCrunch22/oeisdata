%N A225224 A continuous "look-and-say" sequence (without repetition, seed 1,1,1).
%C A225224 A variant of the Conway's 'look-and-say' sequence A005150, without run cut-off. It describes at each step the preceding numbers taken altogether.
%C A225224 The sequence is better described as starting with three 1's: 1, 1, 1, and then 3, 1, and 1, 3, etc., as seed one creates a singular case: 1, then 1, 1, which can be continued either as 2, 1 (ignoring the aforesaid first 1, cf. A221646), or as 3, 1, considering twice the first one.
%C A225224 Contrary to the original look-and-say, this sequence is not base dependent, because figures or group of figures are not aggregated and read as numbers.
%C A225224 The sequence is determined by pairs. Terms of even ranks are counts while odd ranks are numbers.
%C A225224 As in the original look-and-say sequence, a(n) is always equal to 1, 2 or 3. The subsequence 3,3,3 never appears.
%C A225224 Two successive odd ranks cannot be equal, which implies that sequences of length three always begin on even rank and that two such sequences never follow each other.
%C A225224 Applying the look-and-say principle to the sequence itself, it is simply shift three ranks to the left.
%C A225224 With seed 2 (resp. 3), the sequence is A088203 (resp. A088204). These two sequences are shifted one rank left by the look-and-say transform.
%C A225224 With seed 2, the sequence A088203 is the concatenation of A006751 (original look-and-say method by blocks): this is because all blocks begin with 1 or 3 and end with 2 and therefore, there is no possible interaction between blocks after concatenation.
