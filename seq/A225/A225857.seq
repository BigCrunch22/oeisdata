%C A225857 From _Peter Munn_, Nov 11 2023: (Start)
%C A225857 Numbers k whose 5-rough part, A065330(k), is congruent to 1 modulo 4.
%C A225857 Contains all nonzero squares.
%C A225857 Positive integers in the multiplicative subgroup of rationals generated by 2, 3, 5 and integers congruent to 1 modulo 12. Thus, the sequence is closed under multiplication and, provided the result is an integer, under division.
%C A225857 This subgroup has index 2 and does not include -1, so is the complement of its negation. In respect of the sequence, the index 2 property implies we can take any absent positive integer m, and divide by m all terms that are multiples of m to get the complementary sequence, A225858.
%C A225857 Likewise, the sequence forms a subgroup of index 2 of the positive integers under the operation A059897(.,.).
