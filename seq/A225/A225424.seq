%N A225424 Least prime p such that prime(n) is the next prime number in the Collatz (3x+1) iteration of p, or 0 if there is no such prime.
%C A225424 The next term, surprisingly, is the 2743-digit (53 * 2^9107 - 1)/3. See A177331 for additional prime numbers, besides 3, that are not in the Collatz iteration of any prime number.
%e A225424 a(4) = 37 because the Collatz iteration of 37 is {37, 112, 56, 28, 14, 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1}, which shows that 7 is the next prime after 37.
