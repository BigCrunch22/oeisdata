%N A225822 Lesser of adjacent odd numbers with different parity of binary weight and both isolated from odd numbers of same parity of binary weight.
%C A225822 Write the sequence of odious odd numbers above the sequence of evil odd numbers connecting all that are 2 apart:
%C A225822 1 7 11-13 19-21 25 31 35-37 41 47-49 55 59-61 67-69 73 79-81 87 91-93 97
%C A225822 3-5  9 15-17 23 27-29 33 39 43-45 51-53 57 63-65 71 75-77 83-85 89 95 99-
%C A225822 Remove the connected numbers:
%C A225822 1 7             25 31       41       55             73       87       97
%C A225822      9       23       33 39             57       71             89  95
%C A225822 Define these as "isolated".
%C A225822 The sequence is the smaller of the remaining pairs that are 2 apart.
%C A225822 The 1 is not a member since there is no change in parity between 1 and 7.
%C A225822 All of the differences between adjacent numbers in both the evil and odious sequences are either 2, 4 or 6, with 4 being the indicator that a transition in parity occurs. The program provided utilizes that fact to produce the sequence.
%C A225822 The sequence that includes all numbers along this path is A047522 (numbers congruent to {1,7} mod 8). This is also the same as the odd terms of A199398 (XOR of the first n odd numbers).
%C A225822 This sequence is similar to A044449 (numbers n such that string 1,3 occurs in the base 4 representation of n but not of n+1), but it contains additional terms. An example is 119. Its base 4 representation is 1313 while the base 4 representation of 120 is 1320. It may be that another workable definition of the sequence is -- numbers n in base 4 representation such that string 1,3 occurs one less time in n+1 than n, but I have not been able to check this.
%C A225822 The difference between the numbers in the sequence is always either 8 or 16, however there appears to be no recurring repetitions in it. Writing the 8 as a 0 and the 16 as a 1 (or dividing the difference pattern by 2 and subtracting a 1) produces a difference pattern of: 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1... which is an infinite word.
%C A225822 A similar process writing Even Odious over Even Evils produces 6, 22, 30, 38, 54, 70... which is twice A131323 (Odd numbers n such that the binary expansion ends in an even number of 1's), with all numbers along the path given by A047451 (numbers congruent to  {0,6} mod 8) and yields the same difference pattern which produces the same infinite word.
