%N A225432 Twice the coefficient of sqrt(q) in e^h, where e is the fundamental unit and h is the class number of Q(sqrt(q)), q prime and congruent to 1 mod 4. (The coefficient lies in (1/2)Z, so twice it is an integer.)
%C A225432 This also arises in the relation satisfied by Euler classes in the connective K-theory of the classifying space of the group of order pq, where p=(q-1)/2. See p. 39 in Bruner and Greenlees, cited below. Take an irreducible representation of the cyclic group of order q which generates the representations as a ring, induce it up to the group of order pq, and let z be its Euler class in ku^{2p}(BG_{pq}). Then z satisfies the relation z^3 -2bq z^2 + qz = 0. This follows from the arithmetic fact that in Q(sort(q)) we have the relation e^h = a + b sqrt(q), as shown on pp. 39-42 of Bruner and Greenlees.
%C A225432 This is closely related to the subsequence of A078357 containing those entries such that the corresponding entry in A077426 is prime. However, a(22) = 226 (corresponding to e^3 = 1710 + 113*sqrt(229)) does not occur in A078357, and more such terms appear after this.
%C A225432 For the n-th Pythagorean prime q=A002144(n), a(n) is also -1/q of the coefficient of term x in the minimal polynomial of A=Product_{a} 2*sin(a*Pi/q) (where the index runs through all quadratic residues in {1,2,...,q-1}) and B=Product_{b} 2*sin(b*Pi/q) (where the index runs through all quadratic nonresidues in {1,2,...,q-1}). It is easy to show that A*B = p. By the class number formula of real quadratic number fields, one obtains B/A = e^(+-2h), so A+B = sqrt(q)*(e^h+e^(-h)) is exactly q*a(n). - _Zichang Wang_, Dec 15 2022
