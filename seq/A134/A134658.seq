%N A134658 Triangle read by rows, giving coefficients of extended Jacobsthal recurrence.
%C A134658 Sequence identical to half its p-th differences from the second term.
%C A134658 This sequence is the second of a family after A135356.
%C A134658 This triangle looks like a Pascal's triangle without first column, and with signs and with additional right diagonal consisting of 2's. - _Michel Marcus_, Apr 07 2019
%F A134658 Every row sums to 3. - _Jean-François Alcover_, Apr 04 2019 (further to a remark e-mailed by _Paul Curtz_).
