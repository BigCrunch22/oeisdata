%N A134952 Number of prime implicants of the Y function of order n.
%C A134952 The Y function of order n is a self-dual monotone Boolean function of (n+1)(n+2)/2 points arranged in a triangular grid, with n+1 points on each side. Suppose we place black or white stones on that grid.
%C A134952 Then, as apparently first pointed out by John Milnor about 1950, either the white or black stones form a "Y" - that is, they touch all three sides of the board. (The corner points each touch two of the sides.)
%C A134952 The Y function tells us whether the white stones or the black stones have the Y.
