%N A134144 A certain partition array in Abramowitz-Stegun order (A-St order).
%C A134144 For the A-St order of partitions see the Abramowitz-Stegun reference given in A117506.
%C A134144 Partition number array M_3(3), the k=3 member of a family of generalizations of the multinomial number array M_3 = M_3(1) = A036040.
%C A134144 The sequence of row lengths is A000041 (partition numbers) [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 22, 30, 42, ...].
%C A134144 The S2(3,n,m) numbers (generalized Stirling2 numbers) are obtained by summing in row n all numbers with the same part number m. In the same manner the S2(n,m) (Stirling2) numbers A008277 are obtained from the partition array M_3= A036040.
%C A134144 a(n,k) enumerates unordered forests of increasing ternary trees related to the k-th partition of n in the A-St order. The forest is composed of m such trees, with m the number of parts of the partition.

%e A134144 a(4,3)=27 from the partition (2^2) of 4: 4!*((3/2!)^2)/2! = 27.
%e A134144 There are a(4,3) = 27 = 3*3^2 unordered 2-forests with 4 vertices, composed of two increasing ternary trees, each with two vertices: there are 3 increasing labelings (1,2)(3,4); (1,3)(2,4); (1,4)(2,3) and each tree comes in three versions from the ternary structure.
%Y A134144 Cf. A049118 (row sums, identical with those of triangle A035342).
