%N A134518 Least k such that the cyclotomic polynomial Phi(k,x) contains n or -n as a coefficient, where k is restricted to be the product of 3 distinct prime numbers.
%C A134518 It is well-known that k=105 is the first number for which Phi(k,x) has a coefficient other than -1, 0, or 1. See A013594 for the case when k has no restrictions.
