%N A134411 a(n) is the smallest positive integer such that the numerator of (Sum_{k=1..n} 1/a(k)) is prime (or 1), for all positive integers n.
%e A134411 The sum of the reciprocals of the first 9 terms is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1 + 1/3 + 1 + 1 = 43/6. (And the numerator, 43, is prime.) Adding the reciprocal of 1 to this gets 49/6 (in reduced form). But 49 is composite. However, adding the reciprocal of 2 to 43/6 gets 23/3 (when written in reduced form). 23 is a prime, so therefore a(10) = 2.
