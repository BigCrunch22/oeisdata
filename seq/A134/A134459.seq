%N A134459 Numbers n such that lcm(1,...,n-1) < lcm(1,...,n) < lcm(1,...,n+1).
%C A134459 Or, numbers n such that A003418(n-1) < A003418(n) < A003418(n+1). Sequence is the union(A019434 - 1, A000668).
%C A134459 lcm(1..n-1) < lcm(1..n) iff n is a prime power. So the sequence consists of those n for which both n and n+1 are prime powers. By Catalan's conjecture (proved by Mihailescu), the only case where n and n+1 are both powers > 1 is n=8. Otherwise, whichever of n and n+1 is even must be a power of 2 and the other must be a prime: either a Mersenne prime if n+1 is the power of 2, or a Fermat prime if n is the power of 2. - _Robert Israel_
%F A134459 a(n) = A006549(n+1) for n >= 1 (cf. Robert Israel's comment). - _Georg Fischer_, Nov 02 2018
%Y A134459 Cf. A000668, A003418, A006549, A019434. Essentially a duplicate of A068194.
