%N A134620 Numbers such that the sum of 4th power of their prime factors is a prime.
%C A134620 Prime factors must be taken with multiplicity. - _Harvey P. Dale_, May 23 2012
%C A134620 The calculation of higher terms is time-consuming, since for any number of the form 2*p with a prime number p > 10^5 the primality test have to be accomplished for a number > 10^20. - _Hieronymus Fischer_, May 21 2013

%e A134620 a(2) = 10, since 10 = 2*5 and 2^4+5^4 = 641 which is prime.
%e A134620 a(9) = 45, since 45 = 3*3*5 and 3^4+3^4+5^4 = 787 which is prime.
%e A134620 a(9883) = 333314, since 333314 = 3*166657 and 2^4+166657^4 = 771425941499397811217 which is prime.
