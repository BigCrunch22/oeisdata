%N A134322 Positive integers with fewer non-isolated divisors than isolated divisors. A divisor, k, of n is non-isolated if (k-1) or (k+1) also divides n. A divisor, k, of n is isolated if neither (k-1) nor (k+1) divides n.
%C A134322 All odd positive integers are in the sequence, since every divisor of any odd number is isolated.
%e A134322 The divisors of 50 are 1,2,5,10,25,50. Of these, 1 and 2 are non-isolated divisors and 5,10,25,50 are isolated divisors. There are fewer non-isolated divisors (2 in number) than isolated divisors (4 in number), so 50 is in the sequence.
