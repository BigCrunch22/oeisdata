%N A134363 Irregular triangle read by rows where n-th row (of A061395(n) terms, for n>=2) is such that n = Product_{j=1..A061395(n)} prime(j)^(Sum_{k=1..j} T(n,k)). Row 1 is {0}.
%C A134363 The rows of this triangle also give all the ordered ways that a finite number of integers can be arranged so that their partial sums, from left to right, are all nonnegative and their total sum is positive.
