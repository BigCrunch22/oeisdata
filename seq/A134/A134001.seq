%N A134001 Array read by antidiagonals: row n contains the positive integers each with exactly n positive "isolated divisors". A divisor, k, of n is isolated if neither (k-1) nor (k+1) divides n.
%C A134001 The left column (column 1) of the array is sequence A133997. The array starts at column 1 and row 2. The only positive integers each with exactly 1 isolated divisor are 1,4,6.
%e A134001 2 isolated divisors:  3,  5,  7,  8, 10, ...
%e A134001 3 isolated divisors:  9, 16, 18, 25, ...
%e A134001 4 isolated divisors: 15, 21, 24, ...
%e A134001 etc.
%Y A134001 Cf. A133997, A134000.
