%N A134321 Positive integers with the same number of non-isolated divisors as isolated divisors. A divisor k of n is non-isolated if k-1 and/or k+1 also divides n. A divisor k of n is isolated if neither k-1 nor k+1 divides n.
%C A134321 Comments from _Hugo van der Sanden_, Oct 30 2007 and Oct 31 2007: (Start) Almost all the entries are of the form 2p or 2pq where q = 2p +/- 1 (and so p is in A005383 or A005384). The exceptions are: 8 18 24 40 56 60 72 84 132 156 210 220 380 ... with no others up to 2e6, suggesting that this exception list is finite and complete.
%C A134321 See also my comments on A134320. For the present sequence, we see that elements cannot be perfect squares since those have an odd number of divisors.
%C A134321 Thus they must either be oblong numbers with one isolated divisor below the square root (such as the isolated 5 for 110) or non-oblong numbers with all divisors below the square root being non-isolated.
%C A134321 I expect that proving this sequence consists only of the two general classes and the finite, complete list of exceptions describe above is also possible and would use a similar approach to the first case. (End)

%e A134321 The divisors of 40 are 1,2,4,5,8,10,20,40. Of these, 1,2,4,5 are non-isolated divisors and 8,10,20,40 are isolated divisors. There are the same number of non-isolated divisors (4 in number) as isolated divisors (4 in number), so 40 is in the sequence.
