%N A134496 Numbers that are not lunar pseudoprimes.
%C A134496 A number n is a lunar pseudoprime if it has no lunar divisors with length in the range 2, 3, ..., len(n)-1.
%C A134496 So the present sequence consists of the numbers which do have a lunar divisor of length in the range 2, 3, ..., len(n)-1.
