%e A134333 a(1) = 4, since 4 has 2 prime factors and 2 is a prime factor of 4.
%e A134333 a(4) = 12, since 12 = 2*2*3 has 3 prime factors, and 3 is a prime factor of 12.
%e A134333 a(21) = 75, since 75 = 3*3*5 has 3 prime factors. and 3 is a prime factor of 75.
%e A134333 9 = 3*3 is not a term, since the number of prime factors (=2) is not a divisor of 9.
%e A134333 28 = 2*2*7 is not a term, since the number of prime factors (=3) is not a divisor of 28.
