%N A134666 Number of multiply perfect numbers (A007691) having 2^n as the highest power of 2.
%C A134666 It appears that a(n)>0 for all n. With the exception of n=2, a(n)=1 when n is p-1, where p is a Mersenne prime (A000043). Flammenkamp has an attractive graph of this sequence, including n for which there is incomplete data.
