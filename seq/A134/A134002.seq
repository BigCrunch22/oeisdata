%N A134002 Positive integers n such that n(n+5)=a(a+5)+b(b+5) is solvable in positive integers.
%C A134002 Conjecture. If n a positive integer not a term of this sequence, then n^2+(n+5)^2 is prime. (This has been verified up to n=500.) Examples. For n=1,2,3,4,6,7, n^2+(n+5)^2 is 37, 53,73, 97, 157 and 193, each of which is prime. See A134003 for the complement of this sequence.
%e A134002 5(5+5)=50=14+36=2(2+5)+4(4+5), so 5 is a term of the sequence.
