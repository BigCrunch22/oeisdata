%N A134286 Characteristic sequence for sequence A026905.
%C A134286 This partition array is the member k=1 in the family M_0(k), with M_0(2)=M_0= A048996, M_0(3)= A134283, etc.
%C A134286 When read as partition array (tabf with sequence of row lengths given by the partition numbers A000041) in Abramowitz-Stegun order (see A117506 for the reference) a(n,k) is the characteristic partition array for the partition (1^n) of n.
