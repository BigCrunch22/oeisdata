%N A134625 Sum-fill array starting with (1,2,3,4,...).
%C A134625 Every row is a permutation of the positive integers. (Row 2) = A006369. The sequence represents the para-sequence in which the "final ordering" << is given by 1 << ... << 4 << 3 << 2. In every row after row n, for each k<=n, k+1 precedes k and all the numbers between k+1 and k exceed k+1.

%F A134625 Row 1 is the sequence of positive integers. Row n>=2 is produced from row n by the sum-fill operation, defined on an arbitrary infinite or finite sequence x = (x(1), x(2), x(3), ...) by the following two steps: Step 1. Form the sequence x(1), x(1)+x(2), x(2), x(2)+x(3), x(3), x(3)+x(4), ...; i.e., fill the space between x(n) and x(n+1) by their sum. Step 2. Delete duplicates; i.e. letting y be the sequence resulting from Step 1, if y(n+h)=y(n) for some h>=1, then delete y(n+h).
%e A134625 Starting with x = row 1, Step 1 gives
%e A134625 y = (1,3,2,5,3,7,4,9,5,11,6,13,...).
%e A134625 Delete the second 3,5,7,... leaving row 2:
