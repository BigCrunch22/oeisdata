%N A134341 Numbers whose fifth powers have a partition as a sum of fifth powers of four positive integers.
%C A134341 The only primitive terms (that is, in which the summands do not all have a common factor) known are 144 and 85359. - _Jianing Song_, Jan 24 2020
%C A134341 The paper by Lander and Parkin where they just give the first known counterexample to Euler's conjecture, 27^5 + 84^5 + 110^5 + 133^5 = 144^5, found using a CDC6600, is known as one of the shortest published proofs. - _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 11 2020

%e A134341 a(1) = 144 because 144^5 = 27^5 + 84^5 + 110^5 + 133^5;
%e A134341 a(593) = 85359 because 85359^5 = 55^5 + 3183^5 + 28969^5 + 85282^5 = 4531548087264753520490799 (Jim Frye 2005). [Typo corrected by _SÃ©bastien Palcoux_, Jul 05 2017]
