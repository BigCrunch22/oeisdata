%e A134194 The prime factorization of 24 is 2^3 * 3^1. The exponents are 3 and 1. The positive divisors of 24 are 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24. Therefore since only the divisors 1 and 3 occur among the exponents in the prime factorization of 24, then a(24) = 2 is the smallest divisor not occurring among those exponents.
%e A134194 The prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 * 5^1. The exponents are 3 and 1. The positive divisors of 40 are 1,2,4,5,8,10,20,40. Therefore since only the divisor 1 occurs among the exponents in the prime factorization of 40, then a(40) = 2 is the smallest divisor not occurring among those exponents.
