%N A134162 Let S(k) be the sequence s() defined by s(1) = k; for i > 1, s(i) = s(i-1) + gcd(s(i-1), i). Start with the list of positive integers and remove any k's for which S(k) merges with an S(m) with m < k. Each value k > 1 is conjectural.
%C A134162 For the given initial values k, it is conjectural that their sequences S(k) never merge. The S(k) have been checked to be distinct for 2^60 terms (see Rowland link), but it is possible that they merge later on.
