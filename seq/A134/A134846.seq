%N A134846 Smallest number k containing no zero digit such that k^2 contains exactly n zeros.
%C A134846 The corresponding squares are in A134847.
%C A134846 Browkin (see link, p. 29) gives a number without zero digits whose square has 26 zeros: 4472135954999579392819^2 = 20000000000000000000005837591200400708766761. However, he does not claim that it is the smallest such number, so a(26) <= 4472135954999579392819.
%C A134846 Indeed, there are much smaller candidates for a(26), such as 489899998999999999. We also have a(20) <= 49899989999999 and a(21) <= 498998998999998. - _Giovanni Resta_, Jun 28 2019
