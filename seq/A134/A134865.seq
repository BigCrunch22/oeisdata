%N A134865 Numbers k meeting the following criterion: if k is a multiple of d, then it is also a multiple of the smallest number with same number of divisors as d.
%C A134865 Note that this is not a subsequence of A002182: 100800 is in this sequence but not in A002182. - _J. Lowell_, Feb 22 2008
%C A134865 A subset of A005179. - _Max Alekseyev_, May 19 2008
%C A134865 A number k is in this sequence iff for every divisor d of k, A005179(A000005(d)) (= A140635(d)) is also a divisor of k. So the question of the finiteness of this sequence is closely related to the form of the elements of A005179. - _Max Alekseyev_, May 19 2008, May 20 2008
%C A134865 Rearrangement of this sequence, forming a subsequence of A005179, is given by A140753. Corresponding indices of elements of A005179 are given by A138394 and A140752. - _Max Alekseyev_, May 26 2008
%C A134865 A subsequence of A007416 which is a subsequence of A025487, so every term is primally tight and even (after the first term). Thus if d is a divisor of a term, then the least integer with the same prime signature as d (=A046523(d)) is also a divisor. So only the divisors that are in A025487 need be tested. - _Ray Chandler_
%C A134865 a(32) > 8*10^25 if it exists. - _David A. Corneth_, Dec 10 2021
%F A134865 a(n) = A005179(A140752(n)). - _Max Alekseyev_, May 26 2008
%e A134865 60 is a multiple of 30 with 8 divisors, but not of 24 (the smallest number with 8 divisors) so 60 is not a term of this sequence.
