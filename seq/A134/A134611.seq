%N A134611 Nonprime numbers such that the root mean cube of their prime factors is an integer (where the root mean cube of c and d is ((c^3+d^3)/2)^(1/3)).
%C A134611 The prime factors are taken with multiplicity.
%C A134611 All perfect prime powers (A025475) are included. First term not included in A025475 is a(30) = 1512 = A134613(2) = A134613(1).
%C A134611 Most terms have a last digit of 1 or 9 (i.e., 8326 out of 9000 terms). Mainly, this comes from the fact that all squares of primes are included. Since each prime > 10 has a last digit of 1, 3, 7 or 9, its square has a last digit of 1 or 9. In addition, m-th powers of primes have a last digit of 1, if m == 0 (mod 4), and have a last digit of 1 or 9 if m == 2 (mod 4), and have a 50% chance, roughly, for a last digit of 1 or 9, if m == 1 (mod 4) or m == 3 (mod 4). Since the number of terms <= N which are squares of primes is PrimePi(sqrt(N)) = A000720(sqrt(N)), it follows that the number of terms <= N which have a last digit of 1 or 9 is greater than PrimePi(sqrt(N)). This can be estimated as 2*N^(1/2)/log(N), approximately.

%e A134611 a(6) = 25, since 25 = 5*5 and ((5^3+5^3)/2)^(1/3) = 5.
%e A134611 a(30) = 1512, since 1512 = 2*2*2*3*3*3*7 and ((3*2^3+3*3^3+7^3)/7)^(1/3) = 64^(1/3) = 4.
