%N A134000 Array read by antidiagonals: row n contains the positive integers each with exactly n positive "non-isolated divisors". A divisor, k, of n is non-isolated if (k-1) or (k+1) also divides n.
%C A134000 The left column (column 1) of the array is sequence A133996. This array written as a sequence is a permutation of the even positive integers. The array starts at column 1 and row 2. (There are no integers with exactly 1 non-isolated divisor.)
%e A134000 2 non-isolated divisors: 2, 4, 8, 10, 14, ...
%e A134000 3 non-isolated divisors: 6, 18, 54, 66, ...
%e A134000 4 non-isolated divisors: 12, 20, 24, ...
%e A134000 etc.
%Y A134000 Cf. A134001, A133996.
