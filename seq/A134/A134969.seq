%N A134969 List of pairs of primes that are separated by the equivalent of 2 quadratic intervals. Both primes are greater than their preceding perfect squares by the same amount, or offset. The respective perfect squares can be both odd, in which case the offset is even, or both even, in which case the offset is odd.

%F A134969 PS1 + OfN = P1, PS3 + OfN = P2, where
%F A134969   PS1 = first perfect square,
%F A134969   PS3 = 3rd perfect square,
%F A134969   OfN = an equal positive offset from preceding perfect square, and
%F A134969   P1 and P2 = the prime pair.
%e A134969 Prime pair 71 and 107 have an odd offset of 7 from 64 and 100:
%e A134969   Interval 1: 8*8 = 64 + 7 = 71.
%e A134969   Interval 2: 9*9 = 81 + 7 = 88.
%e A134969   Interval 3: 10*10 = 100 + 7 = 107.
%e A134969 Prime pair 97 and 137 have an even offset of 16 from 81 and 121:
%e A134969   Interval 1: 9*9 = 81 + 16 = 97.
%e A134969   Interval 2: 10*10 = 100 + 16 = 116.
%e A134969   Interval 3: 11*11 = 121 + 16 = 137.
%e A134969 In all cases there is a complete intermediate quadratic interval (#2).
%e A134969 The pair (11,83), 11-9 = 83-81 = 2, does not work because there are 6 squares in between: 16,25,36,49,64,81.
%o A134969 Excel VBA available at http://www.naturalnumbers.org/quadprimes.html#code Demonstrates odd-offset prime-pair distribution with associated twin primes. Limitations: -Only the subset of paired primes for even perfect squares with odd offsets are demonstrated. -Because of the 256-column limitation for an Excel worksheet, data in rows after perfect square 484 are not complete. -Only twin primes that are also paired primes are outlined (in red).
