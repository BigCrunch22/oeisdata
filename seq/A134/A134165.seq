%N A134165 Let P(A) be the power set of an n-element set A. Then a(n) = the number of pairs of elements {x,y} of P(A) for which either 0) x and y are disjoint and for which either x is a subset of y or y is a subset of x, or 1) x and y are disjoint and for which x is not a subset of y and y is not a subset of x, or 2) x and y are intersecting but for which x is not a subset of y and y is not a subset of x, or 3) x = y.

%e A134165 a(2) = 8 because for P(A) = {{},{1},{2},{1,2}} we have for case 0 {{},{1}}, {{},{2}}, {{},{1,2}} and we have for case 1 {{1},{2}} and we have for case 3 {{},{}}, {{1},{1}}, {{2},{2}}, {{1,2},{1,2}}. There are 0 {x,y} of P(A) in this example that fall under case 2.
