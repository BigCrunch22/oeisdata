%C A124728 Subset of A045940 Numbers n such that factorizations of n through n+3 have same number of primes (including multiplicities). Cf. A124057, A124729 Numbers n such that n, n+1, n+2 and n+3 are products of exactly 3,5 primes. There are no numbers n such that n, n+1, n+2 and n+3 are products of exactly 6 primes(?)
