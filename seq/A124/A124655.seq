%N A124655 a(n) = n-th integer from among those positive integers k where every positive integers <= k and coprime to k is also coprime to n.
%e A124655 The positive integers k, where every positive integer <= k and coprime to k is also coprime to 6, form the sequence 1,2,6,12,18,24,30,... So a(6) is the 6th of these integers, which is 24. (3, for example, is not among the sequence of k's because 2 is coprime to 3 and is <= 3, but 2 is not coprime to 6.)
