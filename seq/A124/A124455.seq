%N A124455 Numbers n such that 24n divides the sum of the first 24n nonzero Fibonacci numbers.
%C A124455 Numbers n such that n divides the sum of the first n nonzero Fibonacci numbers are listed in A111035 = {1, 2, 24, 48, 72, 77, 96, 120, 144, 192, 216, 240, 288, 319, 323, 336, 360, ...}. Most of these are multiples of 24. Those which are not a multiple of 24 are listed in A124456 = {1, 2, 77, 319, 323, 1517, 3021, 4757, 6479, 7221, 8159, 8229, 9797, ...}.
%C A124455 This sequence coincides with A072378 (12n | F(12n)) for all values up to 84. The first two different terms are 86 and 164.
%C A124455 Prime a(n) are {2, 3, 5, 281, ...}.
