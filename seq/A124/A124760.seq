%N A124760 Number of rises for compositions in standard order.
%C A124760 The standard order of compositions is given by A066099.
%C A124760 A114994 seems to give the positions of zeros. - _Antti Karttunen_, Jul 09 2017
%C A124760 A composition of n is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to n. The k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. a(n) is one fewer than the number of maximal weakly decreasing runs in this composition. Alternatively, a(n) is the number of strict ascents in the same composition. For example, the weakly decreasing runs of the 1234567th composition are ((3,2,1),(2,2,1),(2),(5,1,1,1)), so a(1234567) = 4 - 1 = 3. The 3 strict ascents together with the weak descents are: 3 >= 2 >= 1 < 2 >= 2 >= 1 < 2 < 5 >= 1 >= 1 >= 1. - _Gus Wiseman_, Apr 08 2020

%F A124760 For a composition b(1),...,b(k), a(n) = Sum_{i = 1 .. k-1} [b(i+1) > b(i)], where [ ] is Iverson bracket, giving in this case 1 only if b(i+1) > b(i), and 0 otherwise. - Formula clarified by _Antti Karttunen_, Jul 10 2017
%F A124760 For n > 0, a(n) = A124765(n) - 1. - _Gus Wiseman_, Apr 08 2020
%e A124760 Composition number 11 is 2,1,1; 2>=1>=1, so a(11) = 0.
