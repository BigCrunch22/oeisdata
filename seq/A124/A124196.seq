%N A124196 Natural numbers, but with every number containing the decimal digit 5 replaced by the number that would normally have occurred minus 5 times the number of 5's (as digits) that would have normally already occurred before that number.
%e A124196 E.g. by 15, 5 should have occurred once, therefore the entry is 15 - 5 = 10
%e A124196 By 25, 5 should have occurred twice, therefore 25-5-5=15
%e A124196 By 35, 5 should have occurred three times, therefore 35-(5*3)=20.
