%C A124885 Numbers that are the sum of 2 different primes.
%C A124885 Natural numbers that are not the sum of 3 distinct primes A124868(n) = {1 - 9, 11, 13, 17}.
%C A124885 Natural numbers that are not the sum of 4 distinct primes are {1 - 16, 18, 19, 20, 22, 24, 30}.

%e A124885 a(1) = -1 because there are an infinite number of nonprimes.
%e A124885 a(3) = 12 because 12 = Length[{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 17}] = Length[A124868(n)], where A124868(n) are the natural numbers that are not the sum of 3 distinct primes.
