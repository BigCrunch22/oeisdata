%N A124732 Triangle P*M, where P is the Pascal triangle written as an infinite lower triangular matrix and M is the infinite bidiagonal matrix with (1,2,1,2,...) in the main diagonal and (2,1,2,1,...) in the subdiagonal.
%C A124732 Row sums = A052940: (1, 5, 11, 23, 47, 95, ...).
%F A124732 T(n,k) = binomial(n,k)*(3n-(-1)^k*(n-2*k))/(2n) (1 <= k <= n).
%e A124732 First 3 rows of the triangle are (1; 3,2; 5,5,1) since [1,0,0; 1,1,0; 1,2,1] * [1,0,0; 2,2,0; 0,1,1] = [1,0,0; 3,2,0; 5,5,1].
%e A124732 First few rows of the triangle are:
