%N A124201 a(n) = n-th positive integer from among those positive integers which are coprime to every noncomposite (1 or prime) which is < n and does not divide n.
%C A124201 For which n's are n and a(n) coprime?
%e A124201 The primes < 8 and coprime to 8 are 3, 5 and 7. The positive integers which are coprime to these primes (i.e. which are coprime to 3*5*7) are 1, 2, 4, 8, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, ...a(8) is the 8th of these integers, which is 17.
