%N A124505 Number of regular n-dimensional simplices that can be inscribed on the vertices of an n-dimensional hypercube.
%C A124505 Inscribing a k-simplex on the vertices of a k-cube is only possible when k is congruent to 3 mod 4 (excluding the trivial cases of k=0,1).
%H A124505 Andrew Weimholt, <a href="/A108973/a108973.txt">Further comments</a>
%e A124505 a(3) = 2 because two regular tetrahedra can be inscribed on the vertices of a cube.
