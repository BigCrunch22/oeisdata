%N A124770 Number of distinct nonempty subsequences for compositions in standard order.
%C A124770 The standard order of compositions is given by A066099.
%C A124770 The k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions. - _Gus Wiseman_, Apr 03 2020

%e A124770 Composition number 11 is 2,1,1; the nonempty subsequences are 1; 2; 1,1; 2,1; 2,1,1; so a(11) = 5.
