%N A124074 Consider the map that sends a number m to m - reverse(m) if that is nonnegative, otherwise to m + reverse(m). Sequence gives those numbers that reach a nonzero cycle under repeated application of this map.
%C A124074 There are values of n that apparently grow without bounds under repeated application of this map beginning with 10598, 10698, 10798, 10898, 11588, 11688, 11788, 11888, 11999, ... - _Ray Chandler_, Oct 10 2017

%e A124074 119 is a member because
%e A124074 119 + 911 = 1030 (since the difference is negative),
%e A124074 1030 - 0301 = 729 (since the difference is positive),
%e A124074 729 + 927 = 1656,
%e A124074 1656 + 6561 = 8217,
%e A124074 8217 - 7128 = 1089,
%e A124074 1089 + 9801 = 10890,
%e A124074 10890 - 09801 = 1089, so the terms are cyclic.
