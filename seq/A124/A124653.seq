%N A124653 a(1)=1. a(2)=2. a(n) = smallest positive integer not occurring earlier in the sequence such that every positive integer <= and coprime to (a(n-1)+a(n-2)) is also coprime to a(n).
%C A124653 Is this sequence a permutation of the positive integers?
%e A124653 a(6)+a(7) = 22. The positive integers <= 22 and coprime to 22 are 1,3,5,7,9,13,15, 17,19,21. The smallest positive integer not occurring among the first 7 terms of the sequence which is coprime to 1,3,5,7,9,13,15,17,19, 21 is 8. (7 does not occur among the first 7 terms of {a(k)}, but 7 is not coprime to 7.) So a(8) = 8.
