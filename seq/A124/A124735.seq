%N A124735 Table with all sequences of nonnegative integers sorted first by total plus length, then by length and finally lexicographically.
%C A124735 This can be regarded as a table in two ways: with each weak composition as a row, or with the weak compositions of each integer as a row. The first way has A124736 as row lengths and A124748 as row sums; the second has A001792 as row lengths and A001787 as row sums.
%C A124735 This sequence includes every finite sequence of nonnegative integers.
%F A124735 a(n) = A124734(n) - 1.
%e A124735 The table starts:
%e A124735 0
%e A124735 1; 0 0
%e A124735 2; 0 1; 1 0; 0 0 0
%Y A124735 Cf. A108730, A124736, A124748, A001792, A001787, A124734, A066099.
