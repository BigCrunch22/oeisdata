%N A124454 Maximum possible number of subtrees of an n-node unrooted tree in which each node has maximum degree three (equivalently, rooted binary trees in which some internal nodes may have only one child). A subtree is a nonempty contiguous set of nodes, not necessarily including all descendants of the root.
%C A124454 Can be computed by a straightforward dynamic program too lengthy to list here in which we keep, for each n, a list of pairs (number of subtrees, number of subtrees that contain the root) for different n-node trees. Only the undominated pairs need be kept so the time is polynomial in n.

%e A124454 a(4) = 11 because in the four-node tree with one degree three node and three leaves, there are eight ways of forming a subtree with the central node and some subset of leaves and three more subtrees with just one leaf, for a total of 11 subtrees. The other possible four-node tree (a path) has fewer subtrees.
