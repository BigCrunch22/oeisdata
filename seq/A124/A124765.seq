%N A124765 Number of monotonically decreasing runs for compositions in standard order.
%C A124765 The standard order of compositions is given by A066099.
%C A124765 A composition of n is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to n. The k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. a(n) is the number of maximal weakly decreasing runs in this composition. Alternatively, a(n) is one plus the number of strict ascents in the same composition. For example, the weakly decreasing runs of the 1234567th composition are ((3,2,1),(2,2,1),(2),(5,1,1,1)), so a(1234567) = 4. The 3 strict ascents together with the weak descents are: 3 >= 2 >= 1 < 2 >= 2 >= 1 < 2 < 5 >= 1 >= 1 >= 1. - _Gus Wiseman_, Apr 08 2020
