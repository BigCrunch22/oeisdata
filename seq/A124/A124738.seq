%N A124738 Irregular table where the n-th row consists of those positive integers which are coprime to both n and n+1 and which are <= n.
%C A124738 The n-th row has A057475(n) terms.
%e A124738 The positive integers which are coprime to 8 and which are <= 8 are 1,3,5,7. The integers which are coprime to 9 and which are <= 9 are 1, The integers in both these sequences (1,5,7) make up the row of A124738.
