%N A124912 a(n) = least integer k>=0 such that n=Floor[(3^j)/(2^k)] for some integer j>=0.
%C A124912 Every nonnegative integer occurs infinitely many times. The j-sequence is A124904.
%e A124912 1=[3^0/2^0], 2=[3^2/2^2], 3=[3^1/2^0], 4=[3^2/2^1],...,
%e A124912 so j-sequence = (0,2,1,2,...); k-sequence = (0,2,0,1,...).
