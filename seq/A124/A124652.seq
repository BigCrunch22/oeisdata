%N A124652 a(1)=1. a(n) = smallest positive integer not occurring earlier in the sequence such that every positive integer <= and coprime to (sum{k=1 to n-1} a(k)) is also coprime to a(n).
%C A124652 Is this sequence a permutation of the positive integers?
%C A124652 Alternatively, let a(1) = 1 and S = Sum_{i=1..n-1} a(i); a(n) = smallest positive k != a(i), i < n, such that all primes p | k also either divide or exceed S. - _Michael De Vlieger_, Apr 22 2024

%e A124652 The sum of the first 7 terms of the sequence is 30. The positive integers <= 30 and coprime to 30 are 1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29. The smallest positive integer not occurring among the first 7 terms of the sequence which is coprime to 1,7,11,13,17,19,23,29 is 8. (7 does not occur among the first 7 terms of {a(k)}, but 7 is not coprime to 7.) So a(8) = 8.
