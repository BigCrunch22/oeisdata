%N A124611 a(n) = sum of the positive integers k, k<=n, where each positive integer <=k and coprime to k is also coprime to n.
%e A124611 The positive integers coprime to k and <= k, for 1<=k<=8, are for 1:{1}, for 2:{1}, for 3:{1,2}, for 4:{1,3}, for 5:{1,2,3,4}, for 6:{1,5}, for 7:{1, 2,3,4,5,6} and for 8:{1,3,5,7}.
%e A124611 Those positive integers k which don't have any integers which are not coprime to 8 among those positive integers which are <=k and coprime to k are 1,2,4,6,8. So a(8) = 1+2+4+6+8 = 21.
