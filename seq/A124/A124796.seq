%N A124796 Coefficients in expansion of powers of the operator "multiplication by f(x) followed by differentiation", in the prime factorization order.
%C A124796 Let d o f(x) be an operator of multiplication by f(x) followed by differentiation. (d o f)^m = Sum a([k0,k1,...])*((d^0 f)^k0*(d^1 f)^k1*...)*d^(m-k1-2*k2-...) where the sum is taken over all nonnegative integer vectors [k0,k1,...] such that k0+k1+...=m and k1+2*k2+...<=m.
%C A124796 For all k >= 0 it holds that a(2^k) = a(3^k) = 1 and also a(p) = 0 for all primes p > 3. - _Alexander Adamchuk_, Dec 03 2006 and _Antti Karttunen_, Feb 28 2023
