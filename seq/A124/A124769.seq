%N A124769 Number of strictly decreasing runs for compositions in standard order.
%C A124769 The standard order of compositions is given by A066099.
%C A124769 A composition of n is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to n. The k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. a(n) is the number of maximal strictly decreasing runs in this composition. Alternatively, a(n) is one plus the number of weak ascents in the same composition. For example, the strictly decreasing runs of the 1234567th composition are ((3,2,1),(2),(2,1),(2),(5,1),(1),(1)), so a(1234567) = 7. The 6 weak ascents together with the strict descents are: 3 > 2 > 1 <= 2 <= 2 > 1 <= 2 <= 5 > 1 <= 1 <= 1. - _Gus Wiseman_, Apr 08 2020
%F A124769 a(0) = 0, a(n) = A124764(n) + 1 for n > 0.
%e A124769 Composition number 11 is 2,1,1; the strictly increasing runs are 2,1; 1; so a(11) = 2.
