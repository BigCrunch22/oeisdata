%N A124768 Number of strictly increasing runs for compositions in standard order.
%C A124768 The standard order of compositions is given by A066099.
%C A124768 A composition of n is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to n. The k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. a(n) is the number of maximal strictly increasing runs in this composition. Alternatively, a(n) is one plus the number of weak descents in the same composition. For example, the strictly increasing runs of the 1234567th composition are ((3),(2),(1,2),(2),(1,2,5),(1),(1),(1)), so a(1234567) = 8. The 7 weak descents together with the strict ascents are: 3 >= 2 >= 1 < 2 >= 2 >= 1 < 2 < 5 >= 1 >= 1 >= 1. - _Gus Wiseman_, Apr 08 2020
%F A124768 a(0) = 0, a(n) = A124763(n) + 1 for n > 0.
%e A124768 Composition number 11 is 2,1,1; the strictly increasing runs are 2; 1; 1; so a(11) = 3.
