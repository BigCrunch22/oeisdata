%N A124573 Triangle read by rows where the n-th row is the first row of M^n, with M the (n+1)-by-(n+1) matrix with (3,1,3,1,3,1,...) on its main diagonal and (1,3,1,3,1,3,...) on its superdiagonal.
%C A124573 Companion triangle A124572 is generated by switching the main diagonal with the superdiagonal. The row sum of row n is 4^n.
