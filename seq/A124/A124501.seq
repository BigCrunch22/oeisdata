%N A124501 Number of 1-2-3-4-5-6 trees with n edges and with thinning limbs. A 1-2-3-4-5-6 tree is an ordered tree with vertices of outdegree at most 6. A rooted tree with thinning limbs is such that if a node has k children, all its children have at most k children.
%C A124501 The sequences corresponding to k=2 (A090344), k=3 (A124497), k=4 (A124499), k=5 (A124500), k=6 (this A124501), etc. approach sequence A124344, corresponding to ordered trees with thinning limbs.
%F A124501 In general, if M[k](z) is the g.f. of the 1-2-...-k trees with thinning limbs and C[k](z)=1+z*{C[k](z)}^k is the g.f. of the k-ary trees, then M[k](z)=M[k-1](z)*C[k](M[k-1]^(k-1)*z^k), M[1](z)=1/(1-z).
