%N A124123 Primes not of the form nextprime(f(p)) with p prime, where f(p)=p/2 if p=2 (mod 3), f(p)=2p otherwise (cf. A138750).
%C A124123 These are the primes which cannot be part of a gb-sequence (except as seed).
%C A124123 Is this sequence finite or infinite?
%C A124123 From _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 27 2008: (Start)
%C A124123 The last comment above probably refers not to this sequence but to the "gb-sequences" themselves, e.g., the one starting with 4499221 which reaches a peak of approximately 10^110, cf. Formula and Links.
%C A124123 The function f(p)=p/2 if p == 2 (mod 3), f(p)=2p otherwise, yields a half-integer for primes p=6k-1 and an even number for primes p=6k+1; in all cases nextprime(f(p)) is defined without ambiguity: f(p) will never be equal to a prime.
%C A124123 This sequence lists primes p' not in the range of the map p -> nextprime(f(p)), defined on the primes.
%C A124123 Equivalently, p' is listed iff: (i) no even number between p' and the next lower prime is of the form 2p with p=0 or p == 1 (mod 3), AND (ii) no half-integer between p' and the next lower prime is of the form p/2 with p == 2 (mod 3) and p prime (in both conditions).
%C A124123 This characterization allows easy computation of the sequence, cf. PARI code.
%C A124123 Experimentally, it does not appear that this sequence is finite. Instead, its (local) density within the primes seems to increase, from roughly 25% for the first terms to about 50% at 10^30. (End)
%C A124123 The function f is discussed in A138750. Composed with the nextprime function and restricted to the primes (cf. A138751), it yields a ("natural") variant of the Collatz function on the set of the primes, with (mod 2) replaced by (mod 3). The gb-sequences are the orbits under that function. - _M. F.

%F A124123 Recurrence for a gb-sequence starting with gb(0) = a prime > 2 (the seed):
%F A124123 | If gb(n) = 2 (mod 3) then gb(n+1) := least prime > gb(n)/2;
%F A124123 | otherwise gb(n+1) := least prime > gb(n)*2.
%F A124123 A gb-sequence of length L ends in the loop 7, 17, 11, 7, ... ; gb(L-1) = 7.
%e A124123 Example: a(1) = 5 because there is no prime gb(n) such that gb(n+1) = 5.
