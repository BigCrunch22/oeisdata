%N A124943 Table read by rows: number of partitions of n with k as low median.
%C A124943 For a multiset with an odd number of elements, the low median is the same as the median. For a multiset with an even number of elements, the low median is the smaller of the two central elements.
%C A124943 Arrange the parts of a partition nonincreasing order.  Remove the first part, then the last, then the first remaining part, then the last remaining part, and continue until only a single number, the low median, remains. - _Clark Kimberling_, May 16 2019
%e A124943 For the partition [2,1^2], the sole middle element is 1, so that is the low median. For [3,2,1^2], the two middle elements are 1 and 2; the low median is the smaller, 1.
