%N A124136 a(n) is the smallest prime when larger number of primes arise between numbers and their doubles. Note for example that there are 8 primes between 34 and 2*34=68 and 35 and 2*35=70, but 34 and 35 are not primes and a(8)=37, which is the smallest prime where there are already nine primes between numbers 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 43, 44, 47, 48 and their doubles.
%C A124136 a(n) is the index of first occurrence of prime n in A060715.
%e A124136 a(2)=7 since 7 is first prime when two primes are between 7 and its double.
%e A124136 a(10)=59 since 59 is first prime after 55 and 56 when ten primes are between these numbers and their doubles.
