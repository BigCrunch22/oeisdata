%N A124740 a(n) = product of those positive integers which are coprime to both n and n+1 and which are <= n.
%e A124740 The positive integers which are coprime to 8 and which are <= 8 are 1,3,5,7. The positive integers which are coprime to 9 and which are <= 9 are 1, 2,4,5,7,8. The integers in both these sequences (1,5,7) are multiplied to get a(8) = 35.
