%N A124197 Number of subsets S of {1,2,3,...,n}, including the empty subset, such that if x and y are in S with x<y and x+y even, then (x+y)/2 is also in S.
%C A124197 The second differences of this sequence give A001227, the number of odd divisors of n.
%C A124197 The sequence appeared in Problem B3 on the 2009 Putnam exam, which asked one to find all n for which the second difference equals 1. The second difference is the number of such subsets of {1,2,...,n+1} that contain both 1 and n+1. One such subset is {1,2,...,n+1}, and if n has an odd factor d>1 then the arithmetic progression {1,d+1,2d+1,...,n+1} works as well; hence the second difference is 1 iff n is a power of 2. [Note that the Putnam problem uses n+1 for our n.] This also means that the conjectural formula for the second difference is a lower bound. To prove the conjecture, note that consecutive elements of S alternate in parity (else S contains their average); thus if x,s,y are consecutive elements then x+y is even, so s=(x+y)/2, which means that S is a finite arithmetic progression with odd common difference. Since conversely any such arithmetic progression works, we are done. - _Noam D. Elkies_, Dec 05 2009
