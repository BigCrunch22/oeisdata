%N A124524 Table (read by antidiagonals) where t(1,1) = 1, t(m,n) = number of terms above and to the left of t(m,n) (i.e., number of t(k,j)'s, where 1 <= k <= m, 1 <= j <= n, excluding the t(m,n) case itself) which both divide m and are coprime to n.
%e A124524 The first 4 columns and first 6 rows (excluding t(6,4)) of the table are:
%e A124524   1, 1, 2, 2
%e A124524   1, 3, 4, 3
%e A124524   2, 4, 3, 6
%e A124524   3, 3, 7, 3
%e A124524   2, 3, 3, 3
%e A124524   5, 7, 6,
%e A124524 The number of these terms which both divide 6 and are coprime to 4 is 12 (the 1's and the 3's). So t(6,4) = 12.
