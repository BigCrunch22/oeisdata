%N A124739 a(n) = sum of those positive integers which are coprime to both n and n+1 and which are <= n.
%e A124739 The positive integers which are coprime to 8 and which are <= 8 are 1,3,5,7. The integers which are coprime to 9 and which are <= 9 are 1, The integers in both these sequences (1,5,7) are added get a(8) = 13.
