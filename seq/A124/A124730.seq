%N A124730 Triangle, row sums = powers of 3.
%C A124730 In A124731, we switch the diagonals. In both triangles, row sums = powers of 3.
%F A124730 Let M = the infinite bidiagonal matrix with (1,2,1,2...) in the main diagonal and (2,1,2,1...) in the subdiagonal. The n-th row of the triangle (extracting the zeros) = M^n * [1,0,0,0...].
%e A124730 Row 2 = (1, 6, 2) since [1,0,0; 2,2,0; 0,1,1]^2 * [1,0,0] = [1,6,2].
