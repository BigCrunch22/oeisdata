%N A124145 a(1)=1, a(2)=2, a(n)=smallest number greater than a(n-1) that can be written as sum of consecutive earlier terms in exactly one way.
%C A124145 This sequence is similar to the Hofstadter sequence A005243 except the decomposition into summands has to be unique.
%C A124145 This sequence has similarities with Ulam numbers (A002858); here we consider unique sums of consecutive terms, there unique sums of two distinct terms. - _Rémy Sigrist_, Jan 02 2022

%e A124145 a(7)=10 because 2+3+5=10 is the only way to sum up consecutive terms. 11 is not contained in the sequence because 11=5+6=1+2+3+5 has got more than one decompositions.
