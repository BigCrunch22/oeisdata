%N A124856 Candidate sequence for theme song for OEIS.
%C A124856 The title refers to the Mpeg file. I don't understand the relation between the sequence (as seen in the b-file) and the Mpeg file! - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 13 2010
%C A124856 In fact, Recam√°n's sequence (A005132) has become the de facto theme song for the OEIS - see for example the Noe movie link. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 13 2010
