%N A124767 Number of level runs for compositions in standard order.
%C A124767 The standard order of compositions is given by A066099.
%C A124767 For n > 0, a(n) is one more than the number of adjacent unequal terms in the n-th composition in standard order. Also the number of runs in the same composition. - _Gus Wiseman_, Apr 08 2020
%F A124767 a(0) = 0, a(n) = 1 + Sum_{1<=i=1<k, b(i)!=b(i+1)} 1 for n > 0.
%F A124767 For n > 0, a(n) = A333382(n) + 1. - _Gus Wiseman_, Apr 08 2020
%e A124767 Composition number 11 is 2,1,1; the level runs are 2; 1,1; so a(11) = 2.
