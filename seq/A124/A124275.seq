%N A124275 Terms of A123856 that are not terms of A124273.
%C A124275 Primes that divide A123855(p-1) = Sum_{j=1..p-1} Sum_{i=1..p-1} prime(i)^j but not A124271(p) = Sum_{i=1..p} (prime(i)^p - 1)/(prime(i) - 1).
%C A124275 The next term if it exists is greater than 1000.
%C A124275 The next term A124275(4), if it exists, is larger than 25000. (Checked by calculating sequences A123856 and A124273 to 1200 terms.) - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 10 2006
