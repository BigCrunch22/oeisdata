%N A124104 Sum of the Rand distance between all pairs of set partitions of {1, 2, ... n}.
%C A124104 From _Joshua Zucker_, Dec 21 2006: (Start)
%C A124104 Given a partition of {1, ..., n}, look at a pair of elements. If the two elements are in the same block of the partition, they're called "co-clustered". The Rand distance between two partitions then counts the pairs that are co-clustered in exactly one of the two partitions. The Rand index is found by dividing the Rand distance by (n choose 2).
%C A124104 Example: The distance from 12 3 4 to 1 234 is 4 because of the four pairs 12 (in the first partition but not the second) and 23, 24, 34 (in the second partition but not the first). The maximal distance of 6 is attained by 1 2 3 4 and 1234. The Rand distance has some nice properties, satisfies the triangle inequality and there are linear-time algorithms for computing it. (End)

%e A124104 E.g. a(2) = 2 = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 because the distance from 1,2 to 12 is 1 (and vice versa) and the distance from 1,2 to 1,2 or 12 to 12 is 0.
