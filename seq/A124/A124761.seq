%N A124761 Number of falls for compositions in standard order.
%C A124761 The standard order of compositions is given by A066099.
%C A124761 A composition of n is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to n. The k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. a(n) is one fewer than the number of maximal weakly increasing runs in this composition. Alternatively, a(n) is the number of strict descents in the same composition. For example, the weakly increasing of runs of the 1234567th composition are ((3),(2),(1,2,2),(1,2,5),(1,1,1)), so a(1234567) = 5 - 1 = 4. The 4 strict descents together with the weak ascents are: 3 > 2 > 1 <= 2 <= 2 > 1 <= 2 <= 5 > 1 <= 1 <= 1. - _Gus Wiseman_, Apr 08 2020
%F A124761 For a composition b(1),...,b(k), a(n) = Sum_{1<=i=1<k, b(i)>b(i+1)} 1.
%F A124761 For n > 0, a(n) = A124766(n) - 1. - _Gus Wiseman_, Apr 08 2020
%e A124761 Composition number 11 is 2,1,1; 2>1<=1, so a(11) = 1.
