%C A124015 Comment from _David W. Wilson_, Nov 03 2006: The NSAD includes a restricted set of English words (words of 2 to 14 letters, no proper nouns or derivatives, no words with non-alphabetic characters (e.g., contractions, hyphenated words)) and it is this restricted set that is being counted. Different editions give different counts, so this sequence is not well-defined.
