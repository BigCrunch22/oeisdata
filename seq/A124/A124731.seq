%N A124731 Triangle, row sums = powers of 3, companion to A124730.
%C A124731 In A124730, the diagonals are switched. Row sums are powers of 3 in both triangles.
%F A124731 Let M = the infinite bidiagonal matrix with (2,1,2,1...) in the main diagonal and (1,2,1,2...) in the subdiagonal. Extracting finite n X n matrices of this form, we take M^n * [1,0,0,0...].
%e A124731 Row 2 = (4, 3, 2) since (using the 3 X 3 matrix m = [2,0,0; 1,1,0; 0,2,2]), m^2 * [1,0,0] = [4,3,2].

%e A124731 1;
%e A124731 2, 1;
%e A124731 4, 3, 2;
