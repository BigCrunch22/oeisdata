%N A124054 Array(d,n) = number of ordered ways to write n as the sum of d squares less than d, read by rows, through last nonzero value per row.
%C A124054 Rows terminate with last nonzero element. Row length of row n = A098547 n^3+n^2+1. Row 4 = A123999 Number of ordered ways of writing n as a sum of 4 squares of nonnegative numbers less than 4. Row 5 = A123337 Number of ordered ways to write n as the sum of 5 squares less than 5. Column 0 = A000012 The simplest sequence of positive numbers: the all 1's sequence. Column 1 = A000027 The natural numbers. Column 2 = A000217(n-2) = Triangular numbers C(n-1,2) = n(n-1)/2. Column 3 = A000292(n-2) Tetrahedral numbers = C(n,3).
