%N A124254 Forest-and-trees problem: number of trees visible. (See Comments.)
%C A124254 In an arbitrarily large pine plantation, a tree with a trunk of radius 1/n is located at each of the lattice points of a square lattice (whose rows are spaced one unit apart), except for one empty lattice point at the center of the plantation. How many tree trunks will be visible to an observer located at the empty lattice point? By symmetry, the number must always be divisible by 8, so a(n) is defined to be one-eighth of the number of visible tree trunks. (Each tree trunk is assumed to be a vertical cylinder, centered at its respective lattice point. A tree trunk is considered "visible" unless it is completely obscured from view by one or more other tree trunks.)
%C A124254 Conjecture: a(n) is the number of pairs of coprime numbers (x,y) such that x <= y and x^2 + y^2 < n^2. The Mathematica program is based on this assumption. How important is the decreasing function 1/n of the trunk's radius with respect to n? Does the sequence change if this function changes? - _Andres Cicuttin_, Feb 24 2023

%F A124254 Does a(n)/n^2 approach 0.75/Pi?
%e A124254 Example: at n = 5, there are 8*a(5) = 40 visible tree trunks; defining the origin as the location of the observer, 4 are centered at points on the axes (i.e., (1,0), (0,1), (-1,0) and (0,-1)), 4 are at points on the diagonals (i.e., (1,1), (-1,1), (-1,-1) and (1,-1)) and the remaining 32, beginning in counterclockwise order from the +x-axis, are the ones at (4,1), (3,1), (2,1), (3,2) and the 28 others that result from using every possible reflection of those points across the x-axis, the y-axis, or the diagonal, y=x. (The tree trunk at (4,3) is considered completely obscured by the ones at (3,2) and (1,1), each of which is tangent to the line 4y = 3x.)
