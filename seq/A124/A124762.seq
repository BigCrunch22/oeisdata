%N A124762 Number of levels for compositions in standard order.
%C A124762 The standard order of compositions is given by A066099.
%C A124762 A composition of n is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to n. The k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions. This sequence gives the number of adjacent equal terms in the n-th composition in standard order. Alternatively, a(n) is one fewer than the number of maximal anti-runs in the same composition, where anti-runs are sequences without any adjacent equal terms. For example, the 1234567th composition in standard order is (3,2,1,2,2,1,2,5,1,1,1) with anti-runs ((3,2,1,2),(2,1,2,5,1),(1),(1)), so a(1234567) = 4 - 1 = 3. - _Gus Wiseman_, Apr 08 2020
%F A124762 For a composition b(1),...,b(k), a(n) = Sum_{1<=i=1<k, b(i)=b(i+1)} 1.
%F A124762 For n > 0, a(n) = A333381(n) - 1. - _Gus Wiseman_, Apr 08 2020
%e A124762 Composition number 11 is 2,1,1; 2>1=1, so a(11) = 1.
