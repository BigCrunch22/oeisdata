%N A276165 a(n) is the first-player score difference of a "Coins in a Row" game over the n-th row of A066099 using a minimax strategy.
%C A276165 "Coins in a Row" is a game in which players alternate picking up coins of varying denominations from the end of the row in an attempt to collect as many points as possible.
%C A276165 When a(n) is negative, the second player has a strategy that is guaranteed to collect more points.
