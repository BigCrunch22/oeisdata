%N A276505 Number of rational numbers > 1 whose numerator in reduced form equals n and that can be written as a continued fraction with exactly three partial quotients.
%C A276505 Equivalently, this is the number of solutions of the equation n = xyz + x + z in positive integer x, y and z.
%e A276505 For n=5 there are three rational numbers which satisfy all the conditions: 5/2 = [2;1,1], 5/3 = [1;1,2] and 5/4 = [1;3,1]. Therefore a(5) = 3.
