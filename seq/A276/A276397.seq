%N A276397 Trajectory of 0 under the morphism 0 -> 001, 1 -> 0010.
%C A276397 Or, fixed point of the morphism 0 -> (0,0,1), 1 -> (0,0,1,0).
%C A276397 Each 0 is replaced by the subsequence (0,0,1) and each 1 is replaced by the subsequence (0,0,1,0). It is easily seen that the only possible fixed point must start with 0. From there on the (initial segment of arbitrary length of the) fixed point can be obtained by simply iterating the map starting from this initial value. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 03 2016
%C A276397 The Beatty sequence for beta := (3 + sqrt(13))/2, A080081, has the property b(n+1)=b(n)+4 if n is already in the sequence, b(n+1) = b(n) + 3 otherwise. Here, every occurrence of "1" leads to an insertion of one more "0" (3 zeros instead of 2 zeros after the "1"). Therefore A080081(n)-1 yields the index of the n-th "1" in this sequence, i.e., A080081-1 is the characteristic sequence of the present sequence. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 07 2016
%C A276397 Homogeneous Sturmian sequence with slope alpha = (sqrt(13) - 3)/2 = 1/beta. - _Michel Dekking_, Feb 15 2019
