%N A276309 Integer part of the ratio of alternate consecutive prime gaps.
%C A276309 Conjectures: The most frequent ratio among alternate prime gaps is 1, while the most frequent ratios among consecutive prime gaps seems to be 2 and 1/2, both with nearly the same frequency (see links). It also appears that next four most frequent ratios are 2, 1/2, 3 and 1/3, all four with nearly the same frequency (see links).

%e A276309 For n=2, the second prime is 3, and the next three primes are 5, 7, and 11. So the ratio of prime gaps is (11-7)/(5-3) = 4/2 = 2, and the integer part of this is a(2) = 2. - _Michael B. Porter_, Aug 11 2016
