%N A276684 Between two successive even digits "a" and "b" there are exactly |a-b| odd digits.
%C A276684 The sequence is started with a(1) = 0 and always extended with the smallest unused integer not leading to a contradiction.
%C A276684 The sequence is not a permutation of the natural numbers as 42, for instance, will never appear (according to the definition, 42 should show |4-2| odd digits between " 4 " and " 2 " and shows none).

%e A276684 Between the first 0 and the first 2 of the sequence, there are indeed |0-2| = 2 odd digits (1 and 3).
%e A276684 Between the first 2 and the first 4 of the sequence, there are indeed |2-4| = 2 odd digits (5 and 7).
%e A276684 Between the first 4 and the second 0 of the sequence, there are indeed |4-0| = 4 odd digits (9,1,1 and 1).
%e A276684 Between the second 0 and the first 6 of the sequence, there are indeed |0-6| = 6 odd digits (1,3,1,5,1 and 7).
%e A276684 Between the first 6 and the first 8 of the sequence, there are indeed |6-8| = 2 odd digits (1 and 9).
