%N A276007 a(n) = number of nonzero digits in factorial base representation of n that hit less significant nonzero digits to the right. See comments for exact definition.
%C A276007 a(n) = Number of times a nonzero digit d_i appears in such position i of factorial base representation of n for which there is another nonzero digit in position i - d_i. Here one-based indexing is used for digits, thus the least significant digit is in position 1.

%e A276007 For n=15 ("211" in factorial base) both 2 at position 3 and 1 at position 2 hit the least significant 1 at position 1 as (2-1) = (3-2) = 1, the position where the least significant 1 itself is. These both cases are included in the count, because this sequence counts the total number of hitting digits, thus a(15)=2.
