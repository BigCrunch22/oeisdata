%N A276140 Replacing every "mixed pair" of integers with the absolute difference of the said pair of integers rebuilds the sequence itself (see "Comments" for the definition of a "mixed pair").
%C A276140 A "mixed pair" is a pair of successive integers where one is prime and the other is nonprime.
%C A276140 By definition, the sequence has the repeated pattern nppn (nonprime-prime-prime-nonprime) and starts with a(1) = 1. It is always extended with the smallest integer not used before and not leading to a contradiction.
%C A276140 This sequence is not a permutation of the natural numbers. After 20000 terms, a lot of nonprimes still have not appeeared (and probably never will). The sequence of apparently missing terms is 6, 8, 20, 22, 25, 27, 30, 34, 38, 39, 42, 44, 46, 48, 49, 51, 54, 55, ... (computed independently by Jean-Marc Falcoz and Lars Blomberg).

%e A276140 The "mixed pairs" in the sequence are between parentheses:
%e A276140 (1,2),(7,9),(4,11),(3,12),(15,19),(5,16),...
%e A276140 Replacing the content of the parentheses with the absolute difference of its terms gives (1),(2),(7),(9),(4),(11),(3),(12),(15),(19),(5),(16),...
%e A276140 which is indeed the starting sequence.
