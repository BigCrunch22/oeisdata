%N A276104 Lexicographically first sequence (with no duplicate term) where all the digits "1" are separated by two digits.
%C A276104 The sequence is started with a(1)=1 and always extended with the smallest integer not yet used that does not lead to a contradiction.
%e A276104 To match the infinite digit-pattern 1..1..1..1..1..1.. (etc.) one must use the integer 10 after the third term (which is 3), then use the integer 4, then use the integer 12 (as 11 is forbidden: no integer with consecutive 1's is allowed), etc.
