%N A276886 Sums-complement of the Beatty sequence for 2 + phi.
%C A276886 See A276871 for a definition of sums-complement and guide to related sequences.
%C A276886 From _Michel Dekking_, Apr 30 2019: (Start)
%C A276886 This sequence is a generalized Beatty sequence. According to Theorem 3.2 in the paper "The Frobenius problem for homomorphic embeddings of languages into the integers" this sequence (as a subset of the natural numbers) is the complement of the union of the two Beatty sequences
%C A276886      V := A003231 and W = V+1 (as subsets of the natural numbers) given by
%C A276886      V(n):= A(n)+2n = 3,7,10,14,..., W(n):=A(n)+2n+1 = 4,8,11,15,...
%C A276886 Here A = A000201, the lower Wythoff sequence.
%C A276886 Since the sequence Delta A = A014675 of first differences of A is the infinite Fibonacci word on the alphabet {2,1}, the sequence Delta V = (V(n+1)-V(n)) is the infinite Fibonacci word on the alphabet {4,3}. (Delta V equals A276867 shifted by 1.)
%C A276886 Now if for some k, Delta V(k) = 4, then a distance 3 plus a distance 1 are generated between three consecutive numbers in the complement, whereas if Delta V(k) = 3, then only a distance 3 is generated between two consecutive numbers in the complement.
%C A276886 This means that (skipping a(1)=1)
%C A276886     Delta a = (a(n+1)-a(n)) = gamma(Delta V),
%C A276886 where gamma is the morphism
%C A276886     gamma(4) = 31, gamma(3) = 3.
%C A276886 Since the Fibonacci word is a fixed point of the morphism 0->01, 1->0, this implies that Delta a, skipping a(1)=1, is the Fibonacci word on the alphabet {3,1}. It follows that
%C A276886     a(n+1) = 2*A(n) - n + 1.
