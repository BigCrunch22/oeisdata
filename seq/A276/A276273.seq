%N A276273 Replacing every "mixed pair" of integers with the smallest integer of the said pair rebuilds the sequence itself (see "Comments" for the definition of a "mixed pair").
%C A276273 A "mixed pair" is a pair of successive integers that add to an odd number.
%C A276273 By definition, the sequence has the repeated pattern oeeo (odd-even-even-odd integers) and starts with a(1) = 1. It is always extended with the smallest integer not leading to a contradiction.
%C A276273 Every natural number will appear in the sequence - but very slowly: the biggest integer after 200000 terms is still 18!

%e A276273 The "mixed pairs" in the sequence are between parentheses:
%e A276273 (1,2),(2,3),(3,2),(4,3),(3,4),(2,3),(5,4),(4,3),...
%e A276273 Replacing the content of the parentheses by their smallest term gives (1),(2),(2),(3),(3),(2),(4),(3),...
%e A276273 which is indeed the starting sequence.
