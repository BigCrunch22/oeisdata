%N A276809 Least prime p such that (p^2-1)/24 is divisible by prime(n) or 0 if no such prime exists.
%C A276809 Sequence motivated by a comment in A024702: "The set of prime factors of a(n), however, appears to include all primes".

%e A276809 a(1) = 7 because 7 is the least prime p such that (p^2-1)/24, which is 2, is divisible by 2=prime(1).
%e A276809 a(2) = 17 because 17 is the least prime p such that (p^2-1)/24, which is 12, is divisible by 3=prime(2).
%e A276809 a(3) = 11 because 11 is the least prime p such that (p^2-1)/24, which is 5, is divisible by 5=prime(3).
%o A276809 (PARI) a(n) = {p = prime(n); q = prime(3); while (! vecsearch(factor((q^2 - 1)/24)[,1], p), q = nextprime(q+1)); q;}
