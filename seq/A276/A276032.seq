%N A276032 Number of refinements of the partition n^1 with all numbers taken modulo 2.
%C A276032 Consider the ranked poset L(n) of partitions defined in A002846, and take the elements of each node modulo 2, collapsing two equivalent nodes into 1. Then a(n) is the total number of paths of all lengths 0,1,...,n-1 that start at (n mod 2)^1 and end at any node in the poset.
%C A276032 Odd-indexed terms are the partial sums of Catalan numbers: A014138.
%C A276032 Even-indexed terms are one less than the following odd-indexed term.
