%N A276825 Number of ways to write n as x^3 + P_2, where x and P_2 are positive integers with P_2 a product of at most two primes.
%C A276825 Conjecture: Any integer n > 1 can be written as x^3 + P_2, where x and P_2 are positive integers with P_2 a product of at most two primes.
%C A276825 We have verified this for n up to 10^8, and we guess that a(n) > 1 for all n > 3275.
%C A276825 It seems that any integer n > 1 also can be written as x^2 + P_2, where x and P_2 are positive integers with P_2 a product of at most two primes. Goldbach's conjecture implies that for each integer n > 1 we can write 2*n as p + q with p <= n and q >= n both prime, and hence n^2 - (n-p)^2 = p*(2n-p) = p*q is a product of two primes. In 1923 Hardy and Littlewood conjectured that if an integer n is large enough and not a square then it can be written as the sum of a prime and a square.
