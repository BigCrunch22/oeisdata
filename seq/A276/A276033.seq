%N A276033 Number of generalizations of the partition 1^n with all elements taken modulo 2.
%C A276033 Consider the ranked poset L(n) of partitions defined in A002846, and take the elements of each node modulo 2, collapsing two equivalent nodes into 1. Then a(n) is the total number of paths of all lengths 0,1,...,n-1 that start at any node in the poset and end at 1^n.
%C A276033 Odd-indexed terms are the partial sums of Catalan numbers: A014138.  Even-indexed terms a_{2n} are C_n (the n-th Catalan number) less than the following odd-indexed term.
