%N A276935 Number of distinct prime factors prime(k) of n such that prime(k)^k, but not prime(k)^(k+1) is a divisor of n.

%F A276935 a(1) = 0, for n > 1, a(n) = a(A028234(n)) + [A067029(n) = A055396(n)], where [] is Iverson bracket, giving 1 as its result when the stated equivalence is true and 0 otherwise.
%e A276935 For n = 12 = 2*2*3 = prime(1)^2 * prime(2)^1, neither of the prime factors satisfies the condition, thus a(12) = 0.
%e A276935 For n = 18 = 2*3*3 = prime(1)^1 * prime(2)^2, both prime factors satisfy the condition, thus a(18) = 1+1 = 2.
%e A276935 For n = 750 = 2*3*5*5*5 = prime(1)^1 * prime(2)^1 * prime(3)^3, only the prime factors 2 and 5 satisfy the condition, thus a(750) = 1+1 = 2.
