%N A276638 a(0)=0; thereafter a(n) is the number of matches between the first n terms circularly shifted by s and the reverse of the first n terms, maximized over s.
%C A276638 a(n) is the number of matches between (a(s), ..., a(n-1), a(0), ..., a(s-1)) and (a(n-1), ..., a(0)), maximized over s.
%C A276638 The odd bisection of the sequence (i. e., the subsequence a(2k+1)) appears to be bound both above and below by n^0.63 asymptotically. It includes odd terms only and grows monotonically with many plateaus.
%C A276638 The even bisection of the sequence (i. e., the subsequence a(2k)) appears to be bound both above and below asymptotically by the same power function as the odd bisection with larger coefficients. However, its behavior differs in other aspects: it includes even terms only and exhibits stochastic oscillations with increasing amplitude.

%e A276638 The first 6 terms (0, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3) shifted by 5 to the left yield (3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 4), which coincides with the first 6 terms reversed (3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 0) at 4 positions, and no shift produces more matches than 4, thus a(6)=4.
