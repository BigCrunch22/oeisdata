%N A276711 Number of primes p <= n such that n - p is a perfect power (including 0 and 1).
%C A276711 Conjecture: For n > 1, we have a(n) > 0 except for n = 11^6 = 1771561. In other words, any integer n > 1 other than 11^6 can be written as p + x^k, where p is a prime, x is a nonnegative integer and k is an integer greater than one.  Moreover, any integer n > 5 not among 8, 24, 1549, 1771561 can be written as p + x^k, where p is a prime, and x and k are integers greater than one.
%C A276711 This has been verified for n up to 10^10. On the author's request Prof. Qing-Hu Hou at Tianjin Univ. verified it for n up to 6*10^9, and then the author used Hou's program to check the conjecture for n from 6*10^9 to 10^10. The author has also finished the verification of the conjecture for squares not exceeding 10^14 and sixth powers not exceeding 10^18, for example, 991^6 - 230^5 is a prime. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Sep 22 2016
