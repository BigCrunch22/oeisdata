%N A259212 A total of n married couples, including a mathematician M and his wife W, are to be seated at the 2n chairs around a circular table. M and W are the first couple allowed to choose chairs, and they choose two chairs next to each other. The sequence gives the number of ways of seating the remaining couples so that women and men are in alternate chairs but M and W are the only couple seated next to each other.
%C A259212 After M and W are seated at neighboring chairs, the problem of enumerating the ways of seating the remaining n-1 married couples is equivalent to the following problem: find the number of ways of seating n-1 married couples at 2*(n-1) chairs in a straight line, men and women in alternate chairs, so that no husband is next to his wife. According to our comment in A000271, this problem has a solution 2*(n-1)!*A000271(n-1), n >= 2. Here the coefficient 2 should be replaced by 1, since the place of the first woman W, by the condition, is already fixed.
%C A259212 Also the number of Hamiltonian paths in the (n-1)-crown graph for n > 3. - _Eric W. Weisstein_, Mar 27 2018

%F A259212 From _Vladimir Shevelev_, Jul 07 2015: (Start)
%F A259212 Consider the general formula for solution A(r,n) in A258673 without the restriction A(r,n)=0 for n <= (d+1)/2 in case d=2*n-1. The case when M and W sit at neighboring chairs corresponds to d=1, r=2 or d=2*n-1, r=n+1. In both cases, from this formula we have
%F A259212 A(r,n) = a(n)/(n-1)! = Sum_{j=0..n-1} (-1)^j * binomial(2*n-j-2,j)*(n-j-1)!, n > 1. (End)
