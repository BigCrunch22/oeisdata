%N A259917 All friendly numbers, with smallest member of each club listed just before the second-smallest one.
%C A259917 Run through all natural numbers i = 1, 2, 3, ... in order, and record for each the abundancy index sigma(i)/i. When we reach an abundancy that has been seen before, output first the "old" number which had that abundancy (unless that number has already been output earlier), and output secondly the current i.
%C A259917 By construction, no number can occur more than once in the sequence.
%C A259917 Friendly numbers that are not smallest in their club, appear in increasing order. Friendly numbers that are smallest in their club, appear just before the second-smallest member.
%C A259917 If we were to "forget" to output the smallest member in each club, we would get instead A095301.
%C A259917 Oppositely, if we output the smallest members only, we get instead A259918.
%C A259917 It is not known whether the number 10 belongs to this sequence.
