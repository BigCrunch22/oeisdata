%N A259288 Odd numbers of the form (m*k)^2/(m^2-k^2) for distinct integers m and k.
%C A259288 The first term ending in a 9 seems to be 1225449, and the first term ending in a 1 is 136161.
%C A259288 For 1 <= m <= 10^4 and 1 <= k <= m, there are 9217 numbers of the form (m*k)^2/(m^2-k^2). Of these numbers, only 679 are odd.
%C A259288 If a(n) is not a square, then m = 9*k or m = 7*k. If a(n) is a square, m does not appear to be a multiple of k.
%C A259288 Let a(n) be a square generated by m_1 and k_1. If a(n-1) is generated by m_2 and k_2, then k_1 = k_2 and m_1 < m_2.
%C A259288 The reciprocals of these numbers can be represented as the difference in the reciprocals of two squares (i.e., there exists two distinct integers m and k satisfying 1/a(n) = 1/m^2 - 1/k^2).
%e A259288 (84*12)^2/(84^2-12^2) = 84^2/48 = 147. So 147 is a member of this sequence. (Note that k=12 and m=84 and so m=7*k.)
