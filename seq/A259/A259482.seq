%N A259482 Number of states in smallest deterministic finite automaton that accepts exactly the strings over the alphabet {1,2,...,n} having all permutations of 12...n as subsequences.
%C A259482 The automaton is assumed to be "complete"; that is, there is a transition from every state on every letter.
%C A259482 Also, the length of the shortest string accepted by this automaton is the sequence A062714.
%H A259482 Kevin Ryde, <a href="/A259482/a259482.pl.txt">Perl program running Foma or SFST to construct the DFAs</a>
%e A259482 For n = 2 there is a 6-state automaton accepting (11*22*1 + 22*11*2)(1 + 2)*.
%Y A259482 Cf. A062714.
