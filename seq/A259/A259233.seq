%N A259233 Random number table used by Doom.
%C A259233 From _Simon Howard_, Oct 25 2024: (Start)
%C A259233 The same table of numbers is also used in earlier games by id Software, including Catacomb 3D (1991) and Wolfenstein 3D (1992), but was used as early as the Commander Keen series. Due to code reuse, the table subsequently found its way into games from other companies: Apogee Software's Rise of the Triad (1995) and Raven Software's Heretic (1994) and Hexen (1995) among others.
%C A259233 The sequence is bytes from a 32-bit linear congruential generator using a multiplier of 134775813 and an increment of 1; these parameters were used in the pseudorandom number generators shipped with various compilers produced by Borland International, Inc. in the late 1980s. This suggests that a program built using one of these compilers was used to generate the table. (End)
