%N A259278 Number of compositions of n into parts 1, 6, and 7.
%C A259278 Suppose A is a subset of {1,2,3,...,n} having the following property: if A includes an integer k, then A includes none of the integers k+2, k+3, k+4, or k+5. The number of subsets having this property is a(n+5).
%C A259278 The terms of this sequence also give us this coloring problem's answer: suppose that, given an n-section board, if we paint the k-th section, we can't paint the (k+2)-th, (k+3)-th, (k+4)-th, or (k+5)-th section. In how many different ways can we paint this n-section board (where painting none of the sections is considered one of the ways)? Similarly the answer is a(n+5).

%e A259278 For n=3 so {1,2,3}, the answer is a(3+5) = a(8), so the answer is 6.
%e A259278 It can be checked easily. Here are the subsets: {},{1},{2},{3},{1,2},{2,3}.
%e A259278 For n=4, the number of ways of painting a 4-section board is a(4+5)=a(9)=8; here are the 8 situations:
%e A259278 situation 1: none
%e A259278 situation 2: painted only 1st section
%e A259278 situation 3: painted only 2nd section
%e A259278 situation 4: painted only 3rd section
%e A259278 situation 5: painted only 4th section
%e A259278 situation 6: painted 1st and 2nd sections
