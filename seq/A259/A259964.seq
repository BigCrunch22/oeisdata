%N A259964 A specially constructed B_2 sequence with sum of reciprocals greater than that of the Mian-Chowla sequence A005282.
%C A259964 Constructed using the greedy algorithm (as for A005252) except at 15th term, which is 229.
%C A259964 It had been conjectured that the sum of reciprocals for B_2 sequences was maximized by A005282.  This sequence gives a counterexample.
