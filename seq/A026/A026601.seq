%N A026601 Numbers k such that A026600(k) = 1.
%C A026601 It appears that a(n) gives the position of its own n-th 1 modulo 3 term, the n-th 2 modulo 3 term in A026602, and the n-th multiple of 3 in A026603. A026602 and A026603 appear to have analogous indexical properties. - _Matthew Vandermast_, Oct 06 2010
%C A026601 This follows directly from the generating morphism for A026600: a 1 in position k creates a 1 in position 3k-2, a 2 in position 3k-1, and a 3 in position 3k. Since each block of three terms in A026600 is a permutation of {1,2,3}, these created terms are the k-th terms of their respective index sequences. The proof for the other index sequences is similar. - _Charlie Neder_, Mar 10 2019
