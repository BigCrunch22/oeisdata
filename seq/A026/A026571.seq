%N A026571 a(n) = T(n,n-2), T given by A026568. Also a(n) = number of integer strings s(0), ..., s(n) counted by T, such that s(n) = 2.

%C A026571 The sequence corresponds to the cumulative distribution function of the number of petals in a rooted plane tree with nonempty flowers everywhere but on the root, with flowers made out of petals of size one.
%C A026571 Examples:
%C A026571 a(2)=1 because there is only one element of size 2, and it consists of the root with one descendant with a flower with a single petal attached to it;
%C A026571 a(3)=2 because again there is only one element of size 3 that consists of the root with one descendant with a flower with two petals attached to it;
%C A026571 a(4)=7 because there is one tree with the root and two descendants, each with a flower with one petal only (two petals in total), then there is one tree with the root and one descendant that also has a descendant, and both descendants with a flower with one petal only (two petals in total), and finally there is the tree with the root and one descendant with a flower with three petals.
