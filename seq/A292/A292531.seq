%N A292531 a(n) = 0 if n is a power of 2. Otherwise, product of 2 numbers nearest n that have more 2's in their prime factorization than n.
%C A292531 1) For all odd n, a(n) = n^2 - 1.
%C A292531 2) All numbers in sequence are divisible by 8.
%C A292531 3) a(n) is not divisible by 16 if and only if n = 8k+3 or n = 8k+5.
%C A292531 Proposition 2) is true. Proof: 0 mod 2 = 0, so the conjecture trivially holds when n is a power of 2. For n not a power of 2, a(n) has by definition the repeated prime factor 2^2 and so is divisible by 8 when a(n) > 4. - _Felix Fr√∂hlich_, Sep 19 2017
%F A292531 a(n) = p^2 * ceiling(n/p) * floor(n/p), where p = A171977(n). - _Giovanni Resta_, Sep 19 2017
%e A292531 a(40) = 1536 because 40 has three 2's in its prime factorization, and the closest integers to 40 that have at least four 2's are 32 and 48, and 32 times 48 = 1536.
