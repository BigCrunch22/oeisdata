%N A292703 Values of n such that prime(n) does not divide any 10-digit pandigital number (i.e. any value in A050278).
%C A292703 This is the complement of the finite list of n such that prime(n) divides one or more 10-digit pandigital numbers. That finite list has been obtained by computer; it contains 1102173 numbers, with the first number that is not in the list being 10545 and the last that is in the list being 55537259.
%C A292703 A292471 is the corresponding list of primes.
%C A292703 These are the values of n for which A180489(n) has more than 10 digits, and also the values of n for which A274328(n) = 0.
%e A292703 a(1) = 10545 because prime(10545) = 111119 does not divide any of the 10-digit pandigital numbers 1023456789, 1023456798, ..., 9876543210, and all smaller primes do divide at least one of them.
%Y A292703 Cf. A050278, A061604, A180489, A274328, A292471.
