%N A292946 a(n) = A292945(A163511(n)).
%C A292946 Because A292945(n) = a(A243071(n)), the sequence works as a "masking function" where the 1-bits in a(n) (always a subset of the 1-bits in binary expansion of n) indicate which numbers are of the form 6k+5 in binary tree A163511 (or its mirror image tree A005940) on that trajectory which leads from the root of the tree to the node containing A163511(n).
%C A292946 The AND - XOR formulas just restate the fact that J(-3|n) = J(-1|n)*J(3|n), as the Jacobi-symbol is multiplicative (also) with respect to its upper argument.

%F A292946 a(n) = A292264(n) AND (A292256(n) XOR A292274(n)), where AND is bitwise-and (A004198) and XOR is bitwise-XOR (A003987).
%F A292946 a(n) = A292264(n) AND (A292254(n) XOR A292271(n)). [See comments.]
