%N A292023 Smallest number starting a longest interval of consecutive integers, each of which is divisible by at least one of n primes specifically chosen to minimize the number.
%C A292023 This sequence is similar to A049300, except that A049300 uses only the first n primes.
%H A292023 Pradeep Mutalik, <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-prime-rib-problem-20170814">The Prime Rib Problem</a>
%F A292023 Empirical observations, discovered by heuristic methods augmented by computer searches.
%e A292023 For n=5, the smallest number generating the maximal interval (13) is 114 using the first n primes. However, if all primes are allowed, the smallest number is 24. Hence a(5) is 24.
%Y A292023 Cf. A049300 - see comment above. The maximal interval is given by A058989.
