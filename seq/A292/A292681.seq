%N A292681 Rule 6: (000, ..., 111) -> (0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), without extending to the right of input bit 0.
%C A292681 This is A292680 / 2; the orbit of 1 under A292680 is A266180.
%C A292681 Rule 6 is the smallest rule which is even (otherwise infinitely many bits would be switched on at step 1, for any finite starting value) and nontrivial (i.e., does not lead to extinction nor simple reproduction, possibly shifted left or right, of a single-bit initial state).
%C A292681 In the context of elementary cellular automata, one would usually consider one further bit of output (i.e., the cell which has bit 0 of the input as left neighbor). This leads to A292680 which has all terms even, so it is natural to consider this variant.
