%N A292687 a(n) = Product_{k=0..n-1} (4^(3^k) + 1) = decimal value of the Sierpinski-type iteration result A292686(n) (replace 0 with 000 and 1 with 101) considered as a binary number.
%C A292687 The next term, a(6), has 202 digits and does not fit on one line.
%C A292687 This is the decimal representation of the terms of A292686 considered as binary numbers.
%C A292687 To get a(n+1) from a(n), write a(n) in binary, replace digits 0 with 000 and 1 with 101, and convert back to decimal. Equivalently, consider the binary expansion of a(n) as base-8 expansion, multiply it by 5, and convert back from octal to decimal.
%F A292687 a(n+1) = (4^(3^n)+1)*a(n).
%F A292687 a(n) = Product_{k=0..n-1} (4^(3^k)+1).
%e A292687 a(0) = 1 is already written in binary; multiplied by 5 it yields 5, read in octal is the same as in decimal, a(1) = 5.
%e A292687 a(1) = 5  = 101[2] in binary; consider 101 in base 8 (or base 10), multiply by 5 to get 505, convert from octal to decimal to get a(2) = 5*8^2 + 5 = 325.
%e A292687 a(2) = 325  = 101000101[2] in binary; consider this in base 8 (or base 10), multiply by 5 to get 505000505, convert from octal to decimal to get a(2) = 325*8^6 + 325 = 85197125.
