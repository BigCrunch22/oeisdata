%N A292670 Least number of symbols required to fill a grid of size n^2 X n^2 row by row in the greedy way such that in no row or column or n X n square any symbol occurs twice.
%C A292670 Consider the symbols as positive integers. By the greedy way we mean to fill the grid row by row from left to right always with the least possible positive integer such that the three constraints (on rows, columns and rectangular blocks) are satisfied.
%C A292670 In contrast to the sudoku case, the n X n rectangles have "floating" borders, so the constraint is actually equivalent to say that any element must be different from all neighbors in a Moore neighborhood of range n-1 (having up to (2n-1)^2 grid points).

%e A292670 For n = 2, the 4 X 4 grid is filled as follows:
%e A292670    [1 2 3 4]
%e A292670    [3 4 1 2]
%e A292670    [2 5 6 3]
%e A292670    [4 1 2 5], whence a(2) = 6.
%o A292670 (PARI) a(m,n=m^2,g=matrix(n,n))={my(ok(g,k,i,j,m)=if(m,ok(g[i,],k)&&ok(g[,j],k)&&ok(concat(Vec(g[max(1,i-m+1)..i,max(1,j-m+1)..min(#g,j+m-1)])),k),!setsearch(Set(g),k))); for(i=1,n,for(j=1,n,for(k=1,n^2,ok(g,k,i,j,m)&&(g[i,j]=k)&&break)));vecmax(g)} \\ without "vecmax" the program returns the full n^2 X n^2 board.
%Y A292670 Cf. A292671: grid size independent of block size; A292672, ..., A292679: A(m,n) for fixed n=2,...,9).
