%N A292906 Number of dihedral Carlitz compositions of n.
%C A292906 A cyclic Carlitz composition is a composition of length greater than one where adjacent parts, including the first and the last ones, are distinct. A composition of length one is also considered cyclic and Carlitz. Assume two cyclic Carlitz compositions are considered equivalent iff one can be obtained from the other by a rotation or reversal of order. Each equivalence class obtained is called a dihedral Carlitz composition of n.

%F A292906 a(n) = (A106369(n) + A292200(n))/2.
%F A292906 a(n) = (2*A106369(n) + A291941(n) + 1)/4.
%F A292906 G.f.: (g.f. of A106369 + g.f. of A292200)/2.
%e A292906 a(6) = 5 because n = 6 has the following dihedral Carlitz compositions: 6, 1+5, 2+4, 1+2+3, 1+2+1+2. (For example, the equivalence class for the dihedral Carlitz composition 1+2+3 is {(1,2,3),(2,3,1), (3,1,2), (3,2,1),(2,1,3),(1,3,2)}.)
