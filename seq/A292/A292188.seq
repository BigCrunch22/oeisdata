%N A292188 Composite numbers m such that all prime divisors p > m of 2^m - 1 are of the form p = 2*k*m + 1.
%C A292188 There are no terms of the forms q-1 and 2q with q prime.
%C A292188 Are there infinitely many the terms m = 3q with q prime?
%e A292188 For 2^15 - 1 = 7*31*151, 30/15 = 2 and 150/15 = 10, so 15 is a term.
%e A292188 For 2^16 - 1 = 3*5*17*257, 16/16 = 1 is odd, so 16 is not a term.
