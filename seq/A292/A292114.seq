%N A292114 List of numbers n such that A039655(n) reaches a new record high.
%C A292114 Naively, one might have expected these numbers to have some other distinguishing property (primorials, perhaps), but that seems not to be the case.
%C A292114 Increasingly many of the values are of the form m*p with a (large) prime p and a smooth m, often m = 2^k (for a(n), n = 12, 14, 21, 23, 26, 28, 29, ...) or m = 2^k*3^k' (n = 7, 9, 19, 22, 30, ...) or m = 2^k*5^k' (n = 20, 25, ...). I conjecture that almost all terms are even. Also, for most terms (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 30, 31, ...), either a(n)-1 or a(n)+1 has at most 2 prime divisors. - _M. F. Hasler_, Sep 25 2017
