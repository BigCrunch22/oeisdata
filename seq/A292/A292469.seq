%N A292469 Let P be the sequence of distinct lattice points defined by the following rules: P(1) = (0,0), P(2) = (1,0), and for any n > 2, P(n) is the closest lattice point to P(n-1) such that the Z-coordinate of the cross product of the vectors (P(n-1), P(n)) and (P(n-1), P(j)) is strictly negative for j=1..n-2, and in case of a tie, P(n) maximizes the dot product of the vectors (P(n-2), P(n-1)) and (P(n-1), P(n)); a(n) = X-coordinate of P(n).
%C A292469 More informally:
%C A292469 - the "scalar product" constraint means that the points P(1), ..., P(n-2) are all on the left side of the fixed vector (P(n-1), P(n)),
%C A292469 - the "dot product" constraint means the angle of the vectors (P(n-2), P(n-1)) and (P(n-1), P(n)) is maximized.
%C A292469 See A292470 for the Y-coordinate of P(n).
%C A292469 The points of sequence P spin around the origin, and the segments joining consecutive points of P do not intersect (except at the common endpoint of two consecutive segments); these properties are the original motivations for this sequence.
