%N A292997 Irregular triangle read by rows: lexicographically earliest, minimum size sets, S_n, such that {1, 2, ... n} is a subset of the union of S_n with the sums of distinct pairs in S_n and the differences of pairs in S_n.
%C A292997 Each row is weakly longer than the preceding row, and weakly lexicographically later if the preceding row is the same length.
%C A292997 Conjecture: A225687 gives the row lengths.

%H A292997 Reddit user uoaei, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/72m1d8">For a given maximum integer N, what is the set of integers with minimal cardinality that can give me any integer between 1 and N by only one addition or subtraction between any two elements in that set?</a>
%e A292997 For n = 7, S_7 = {1, 2, 5}. Because {1, 2, ..., 7} can be represented as {1, 2, 1 + 2, 5 - 1, 5, 5 + 1, 5 + 2}, where each term is in S_7 or is the sum or difference of two distinct terms in S_7.
%e A292997 There is no set of fewer than three elements with this property, and S_7 is the lexicographically earliest set of three elements with this property.
