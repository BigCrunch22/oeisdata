%N A292206 Number of unrooted unlabeled connected four-regular maps on a compact closed oriented surface with n vertices (and thus 2*n edges).
%C A292206 Equivalently, the number of unrooted quadrangulations of oriented surfaces with n quadrangles (and thus 2*n edges).
%C A292206 Equivalently, the number of pairs (alpha,sigma) of permutations on a set of size 4*n up to simultaneous conjugacy such that alpha (resp. sigma) has only cycles of length 2 (resp. 4) and the subgroup generated by them acts transitively.
%C A292206 There is no recurrence relation known for this sequence.

%e A292206 For n = 1, a(n) = 2:
%e A292206 1) the figure-eight map on a sphere (1 vertex, which has degree 4, and 2 edges) <-> its dual map, which is the quadrangulation of a sphere created by a 2-edge path (it bounds 1 region, which has 4 boundary segments, even though they are formed by only 2 different edges) <-> the conjugacy class of the pair of permutations ((12)(34), (1234));
%e A292206 2) the map on a torus consisting of two non-homotopic nontrivial loops (1 vertex, which has degree 4, and 2 edges) <-> its dual map, which is the same map again (it bounds 1 region, which has 4 boundary segments, even though they are formed by only 2 different edges) <-> the conjugacy class of the pair of permutations ((13)(24), (1234)).
