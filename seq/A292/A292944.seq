%C A292944 In binary expansion (A007088) of n, clear the most significant bit and all those 1-bits that have another 1-bit at their left side, except for the second most significant 1-bit, even in cases where the binary expansion begins as "11...".
%C A292944 Because A292943(n) = a(A243071(n)), the sequence works as a "masking function" where the 1-bits in a(n) (always a subset of the 1-bits in binary expansion of n) indicate which numbers are of the form 6k+3 (odd multiples of three) in binary tree A163511 (or its mirror image tree A005940) on that trajectory which leads from the root of the tree to the node containing A163511(n).

%F A292944 a(n) = A292272(A004754(n)) - 2*A053644(n).
%F A292944 a(n) = A292943(A163511(n)).
%F A292944 Other identities. For all n >= 0:
%F A292944 a(n) + A292264(n) = A292942(n) + a(n) + A292946(n) = a(n) + A292254(n) + A292256(n) = n.
%F A292944 a(n) = a(n) AND n; a(n) AND A292264(n) = 0, where AND is bitwise-and (A004198).
%e A292944 For n = 23, 10111 in binary, when we clear (change to zero) the most significant bit (always 1) and also all 1-bits that have 1's at their left side, we are left with 100, which in binary stands for 4, thus a(23) = 4.
%e A292944 For n = 27, 11011 in binary, when we clear the most significant bit, and also all 1-bits that have 1's at their left side except the second most significant, we are left with 1010, which in binary stands for ten, thus a(27) = 10.
