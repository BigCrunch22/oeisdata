%N A292244 Base-2 expansion of a(n) encodes the steps where multiples of 3 are encountered when map x -> A253889(x) is iterated down to 1, starting from x=n.

%e A292244 For n = 3, the starting value is a multiple of three, after which follows A253889(3) = 1, the end point of iteration, which is not a multiple of three, thus a(3) = 1*(2^0) = 1.
%e A292244 For n = 8, the starting value is not a multiple of three, after which follows A253889(8) = 3, which is, thus a(8) = 0*(2^0) + 1*(2^1) = 2.
%e A292244 For n = 9, the starting value is a multiple of three, after which follows A253889(9) = 8 (which is not), while A253889(8) = 3 (which is), thus a(9) = 1*(2^0) + 0*(2^1) + 1*(2^2) = 5.
