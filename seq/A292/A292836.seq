%N A292836 a(n) is the minimum number of steps to a terminal state during the following procedure: start with n piles each containing one stone; any number of stones can be transferred between piles of equal size.
%C A292836 A terminal state is one in which all pile sizes are different, that is, there are no legal remaining ways to move stones.
%C A292836 A121924 is the analogous sequence for when only one stone can be moved at a time.
%C A292836 A011371 is the analogous sequence for when all stones must be moved at once.
%C A292836 Both A011371 and A121924 are upper bounds for this sequence.

%e A292836 For n = 6, two examples of a a(6) = 4 step walks to a terminal state are:
%e A292836 [1 1 1 1 1 1] -> [2, 1, 1, 1, 1] -> [2, 2, 1, 1] -> [3, 1, 1, 1] -> [3, 2, 1], and
%e A292836 [1 1 1 1 1 1] -> [2, 1, 1, 1, 1] -> [2, 2, 1, 1] -> [2, 2, 2] -> [4, 2].
