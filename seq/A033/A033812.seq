%N A033812 The Loh-Shu 3 X 3 magic square, lexicographically largest variant when read by columns.
%C A033812 Of course there are a large number of ways to convert this (unique) magic square to a sequence by reading it by rows, so the sequence is hardly unique. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 29 2002
%C A033812 This magic square is referred to Loh-Shu magic square and is attributed to the legendary Fu Xi (Fuh-Hi).
%C A033812 Among all the equivalent variants of this magic square (modulo rotations and reflections) this one can be characterized as the lexicographically largest one when read by columns, i.e., (8, 3, 4, 1, ...), while the lexicographically smallest one would be (2, 7, 6, 9, ...). - _M. F. Hasler_, Jan 26 2019
