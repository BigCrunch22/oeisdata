%N A033029 Numbers whose base-16 expansion has no run of digits with length < 2.
%C A033029 First term that is not a multiple of 17 (A008599) is 273, which is one more than 272 = 16 * 17. In hexadecimal, 272 is 110, which having a single 0 next to a 1, disqualifies it from this sequence. - _Alonso del Arte_, Oct 16 2016
