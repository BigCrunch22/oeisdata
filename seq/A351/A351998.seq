%N A351998 A chain reaction sequence: a digit d1 from a(n) is expelled towards a(n+1) where it hits a digit d2 [from a(n+1)] and replaces it; d2 in turn is expelled towards a(n+2), hits a digit d3 there and replaces it; d3 in turn is expelled towards a(n+3), hits a digit there, and replaces it; d4 is expelled... etc. At the end of the chain reaction, only even numbers will be left. This is the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers with this property.
%C A351998 The sequence is a permutation of the integers > 0.
