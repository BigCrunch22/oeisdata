%N A351542 Even numbers k that have an odd prime factor p such that p also divides sigma(k), but valuation(k,p) differs from valuation(sigma(k), p), and p does not divide A003961(k), where A003961 is fully multiplicative with a(p) = nextprime(p), and sigma is the sum of divisors function.
%C A351542 Even numbers k that have an odd prime factor prime(i) such that it is also a prime factor of sigma(k), but prime(i-1) is not a factor of k, and A286561(k, prime(i)) <> A286561(sigma(k), prime(i)). This differs from the definition of A351543 in that A286561(k, prime(i)) must be > 0.

%e A351542 196 = 2^2 * 7^2 is present as sigma(196) = 399 = 3^1 * 7^1 * 19^1, which thus has a shared prime factor 7 with 196, but occurring with smaller exponent, and with no prime 5 (which is the previous prime before 7) present in the prime factorization of 196.
%e A351542 364 = 2^2 * 7^1 * 13^1 is present as sigma(364) = 784 = 2^4 * 7^2, which thus has a shared prime factor 7 with 364, but occurring with larger exponent, and with no prime 5 (which is the previous prime before 7) present in the prime factorization of 364.
