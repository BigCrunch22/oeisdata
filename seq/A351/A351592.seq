%N A351592 Number of Look-and-Say partitions (A239455) of n without distinct multiplicities, i.e., those that are not Wilf partitions (A098859).
%C A351592 A partition is Look-and-Say iff it has a permutation with all distinct run-lengths. For example, the partition y = (2,2,2,1,1,1) has the permutation (2,2,1,1,1,2), with run-lengths (2,3,1), which are distinct, so y is counted under A239455(9).
%C A351592 A partition is Wilf iff it has distinct multiplicities of parts. For example, (2,2,2,1,1,1) has multiplicities (3,3), so is not counted under A098859(9).
%C A351592 The Heinz numbers of these partitions are given by A351294 \ A130091.
%C A351592 Is a(17) = 0 the last zero of the sequence?
%F A351592 a(n) = A239455(n) - A098859(n). Here we assume A239455(0) = 1.
%e A351592 The a(9) = 1 through a(18) = 5 partitions are (empty columns not shown):
