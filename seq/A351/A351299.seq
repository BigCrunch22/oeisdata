%N A351299 a(n) is the number of distinct bipartitions of a solid triangular array of edge n, discounting inversions, reflections, and rotations.
%C A351299 Determined by exhaustive enumeration and testing. (Related to A061348 but discounting inversions.)
%C A351299 Discounting inversions allows only one of these two to be counted:
%C A351299     1     0
%C A351299    0 0   1 1
%C A351299 Related to A061348 (number of distinct binary labels of a solid triangular array of edge n, discounting reflections and rotations) except that inversions (swapping 0's and 1's) are also discounted.
%C A351299 Note that since the triangular numbers T(n) exhibit the odd/even pattern o o e e o o e e and only the odd triangular numbers are unable to support a 50/50 binary labeling, this sequence is A061348(n)/2 only for odd T(n), i.e., where floor((n-1)/2) is even.
%F A351299 a(n) = A061348(n)/2 where floor((n-1)/2) is even.
%e A351299 For n = 2, the a(2)=2 solutions are
%e A351299     0     1
%e A351299    0 0   0 0
%Y A351299 Cf. A061348.
