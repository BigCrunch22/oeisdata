%N A351993 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct positive numbers such that, when they are written in binary and concatenated, every pair of digits starting from a(1) contains the digits 0 and 1.
%C A351993 Numerous numbers can be immediately eliminated as possible terms in this sequence. Clearly any number whose binary string contains three or more consecutive 1's or 0's cannot be a term. Likewise any number ending with '11' binary cannot be a term as either the 1's appear in one pair, which is not allowed, or the final 1 is the first digit in the next pair, but that would force the next number to have 0 as its first digit, which is also not allowed. Also any number which matches the string XXAXX in binary cannot occur, where 'X' is either 0 or 1 and 'A' is an arbitrarily long string containing an odd number of 0's or 1's. Any such number would either have the first XX in a single pair, and if not, then the second XX would be.
%C A351993 This sequence is the binary equivalent of A345227. As it immediately reaches the regime where almost all pairs of digits must contain 0 and 1 it possibly offers insight into the behavior of A345227 when n >> 10^10 in that sequence.

%e A351993 a(1) = 0 = 0_2, a(2) = 1 = 1_2 (the only way to use two numbers in one pair).
%e A351993 a(3) = 2 = 10_2 (the next smallest unused number to contain 1 then 0 and fill the next pair).
%e A351993 a(4) = 4 = 100_2 (the next smallest unused number to contain 1 then 0, which fills the next pair, and then a 0 in the second-next pair; note that 3 = 11_2 can never be a term).
%e A351993 a(5) = 5 = 101_2 (the next smallest unused number to contain a 1 to fill the pair started by a(4) and then 0 and 1 to fill the next pair).
%e A351993 a(6) = 9 = 1001_2 (the next smallest unused number to contain two pairs both of which contain 0 and 1 and fill the next two pairs; note that 6 = 110_2 and 7 = 111_2 would fill the next pair with two 1's while 8 = 1000_2 would fill the second-next pair with two 0's). Neither 7 nor 8 can ever be terms.
