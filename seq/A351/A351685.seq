%N A351685 a(n) is the row of the Trithoff (tribonacci) array that contains the tails of the sequence which is n times the tribonacci numbers.
%C A351685 This sequence is increasing.
%C A351685 The first term of the row a(n) in the Trithoff array is sequence A351689.
%e A351685 Consider twice the tribonacci numbers: 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 8, 14, 26, 48, and so on. The first few terms can be found in the first row of the Trithoff array A136175. The tail starting with 14, 26, and 48 is the seventh row of the Trithoff array. Thus, a(2) = 7.
%Y A351685 Cf. A000073, A136175, A351689.
