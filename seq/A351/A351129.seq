%N A351129 Number of regions in a regular n-gon with all diagonals drawn whose edges all have the same number of facing edges.
%C A351129 See A351045 for details of an edge's count of facing edges in an n-gon with all diagonals drawn.

%e A351129 a(5) = 1. A pentagon with all diagonals drawn contains a central pentagon which is surrounded by five other triangles and therefore all its edges have a facing edge count of 6. See the attached image.
%e A351129 a(8) = 8. An octagon with all diagonals drawn contains eight central triangles all of which are surrounded by three other triangles and therefore all their edges have a facing edge count of 4. See the attached image.
%e A351129 a(15) = 46. A 15-gon with all diagonals drawn contains one central 15-gon which is surrounded by triangles, thirty quadrilaterals which are surrounded by other quadrilaterals, and fifteen triangles which are surrounded by pentagons. This gives a total of forty-six regions whose edges all have the same facing edge count. See the attached image.
