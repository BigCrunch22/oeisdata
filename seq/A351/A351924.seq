%e A351924 a(3) = 5 as a diagonal of a 6-gon, when all its vertices are connected by lines and where the diagonal passes through the center of the 6-gon, has five vertices on it - the two outer vertices, the central vertex, and two more vertices formed by intersections of the central diagonal with other diagonals. See the linked image of the 6-gon.
