%N A351498 Position k of first term in a run of odd terms with length > 1 in A093714.
%C A351498 Let S = A093714, known to be a permutation of the natural numbers.
%C A351498 S(k) and S(k+1) are odd.
%C A351498 Theorem: S(n) = n implies S(n) and n have the same parity. Proof: S(n) = n iff S(n) mod n = 0, since n | n. If prime q|n yet (S(n),q) = 1, then S(n) != n, a contradiction.
%C A351498 Corollary: Fixed points in S(n) appear iff S(n) and n have same parity.
%C A351498 Corollary: Consecutive odd terms S(k), S(k+1) imply that the smallest missing number u in S is either odd or (S(k),u) > 1.
%C A351498 Fixed points S(k) appear at k in intervals [78, 1787], [15022, 38123], [45052, 1036043]. These positions result from a dataset of S(1..2^30). Are there any more runs of odd terms?
%e A351498 S(1) = 1 and S(2) = 3, therefore this sequence begins with 1.
%e A351498 S(10) = 13 and S(11) = 9, therefore 10 is in this sequence.
%e A351498 S(17) = 23 and S(18) = 15, therefore 17 is in this sequence.
%e A351498 For 2 <= k <= 10, S(k) and k have different parity, but for 11 <= k <= 17, S(k) and k have the same parity.
