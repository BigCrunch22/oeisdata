%N A351869 a(n) is the number of self-complementary score sequences that are possible for strong tournaments on n vertices.
%C A351869 See A000571 for the definition of a tournament and its score sequence. A tournament is strong if every two vertices are mutually reachable by directed paths. Alternatively, a tournament is strong if it contains a directed Hamiltonian cycle.
%C A351869 A sequence (s_1 <= s_2 <= ... <= s_n) of integers is the score sequence of a strong tournament iff Sum_{i=1..r} s_i > binomial(r,2) for 1 <= r < n and Sum_{i=1..n} s_i = binomial(n,2). It is self-complementary iff s_{n+1-i} = n-1-s_i for 1 <= i <= n/2.
