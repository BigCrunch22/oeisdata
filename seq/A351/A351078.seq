%N A351078 First noncomposite number reached when iterating the map x -> x', when starting from x = n, or 0 if no such number is ever reached. Here x' is the arithmetic derivative of x, A003415.
%C A351078 Primes of A189483 occur only once, on the corresponding indices, while A189441 may also occur in other positions.
%C A351078 There are interesting white "filament-like regions" in the scatter plot.

%F A351078 For all n, a(4*n) = a(27*n) = a((p^p)*n) = a(A099309(n)) = 0.
%F A351078 a(p) = p for all primes p.
%e A351078 For n = 15, if we iterate with A003415, we get a path 15 -> 8 -> 12 -> 16 -> 32 -> 80 -> 176 -> 368 -> ..., where the terms just keep on growing without ever reaching a prime or 1, therefore a(15) = 0.
%e A351078 For n = 18, its path down to zero, when iterating A003415 is: 18 -> 21 -> 10 -> 7 -> 1 -> 0, and the first noncomposite term on the path is prime 7, therefore a(18) = 7.
