%N A351103 a(n) is the total number of polygons left over with maximum number of sides when partitioning the set of vertices of a convex n-gon into nonintersecting polygons.
%C A351103 Alternatively, total number of regions left over when partitioning the set of vertices of a convex n-gon into nonintersecting polygons, each containing adjacent vertices of the n-gon.
%F A351103 For k >= 3, a(3*k) = 3, a(3*k+1) = 3*k+1, a(3*k+2) = 3 + a(3*k-2) + a(3*k-1), with a(3)=a(4)=a(5)=0 and a(6) = 3, a(7) = 7, a(8) = 12.
%e A351103 n = 18 is an 18-gon, which has 6 triangles each containing adjacent vertices of the 18-gon and the leftover region in each case is a 12-gon. Since there are only 3 orientations of partitioning, the total number of leftover regions is 3.
%e A351103 n = 19 is a 19-gon, which has 5 triangles and 1 quadrilateral each containing adjacent vertices of the 19-gon and the leftover regions in each case is a 12-gon. Since there are 19 orientations of partitioning, the total number of leftover regions is 19.
%e A351103 n = 20 is a 20-gon, which has 5 triangles with one pentagon or 4 triangles with 2 quadrilaterals. In the first case the number of leftover regions is 20 because it has 20 orientations, in the second case the number of leftover regions is 20 + 20 + 10 = 50 because it has 3 different permutations of 3,3,3,3,4,4 with 20 orientations, 3,3,3,4,3,4 with 20 orientations, and 3,3,4,3,3,4 with 10 orientations. Therefore the total is 70.
