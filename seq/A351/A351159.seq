%N A351159 Number of polyominoes of n cells with both diagonal symmetries, for which the 180-degree rotational symmetry has an axis that coincides with the center of a square, but without 90-degree rotational symmetry.
%C A351159 This sequence enumerates a subset of the polyominoes enumerated by A056878.
%F A351159 For odd n, a(n) = A056878(n); for even n, a(n) = A056878(n) - A351160(n/2).
%e A351159 For a(7)=1, the heptomino with exactly fourfold symmetry and axes of symmetry parallel to the diagonals of the cells is composed of two 2 X 2 squares with one cell in common.
%Y A351159 Cf. A000105, A056878, A351160.
