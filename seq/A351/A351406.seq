%N A351406 For all a(2n) the cumulative sum of the odd digits used so far in the sequence [including a(2n)] is twice the cumulative sum of the even digits used so far in the sequence [including a(2n)]. This is the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct numbers >= 0 with this property.
%C A351406 The sequence is a permutation of the nonnegative integers.
