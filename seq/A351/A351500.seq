%N A351500 Highly composite numbers (A002182) ordered by the number of 2's in their prime factorizations.
%C A351500 If two or more highly composite numbers have the same number of 2's in their prime factorizations, then this sequence simply sorts them in numerical order.
%e A351500 1260 (which has only two 2's in its prime factorization) comes before 24 (which has three 2's in its prime factorization) in this sequence.
%Y A351500 Cf. A002182, A007814, A112779.
