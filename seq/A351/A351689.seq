%N A351689 a(n) is the number in the first column of the Trithoff (tribonacci) array that starts off the row containing the tail of n times the tribonacci sequence.
%C A351689 The sequence is increasing.
%C A351689 a(n) is divisible by n.
%C A351689 The row number where the tail of n times tribonacci numbers appears in the Trithoff array form sequence A351685.
%e A351689 Consider twice the tribonacci numbers: 0, 0, 2, 2, 4, 8, 14, 26, 48, and so on. The first few terms can be found in the first row of the Trithoff array A136175. The tail starting with 14, 26, and 48 is the seventh row of the Trithoff array. The first number in the seventh row is 14. Thus, a(2) = 14.
