%N A351723 Numbers of the form x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + x*y*z with x,y,z nonnegative integers.
%C A351723 It is easy to see that no term is congruent to 3 modulo 4.
%C A351723 Conjecture 1: a(n) < 2*n for all n > 0, and a(n)/n has a limit as n tends to the infinity. Also, a(n) <= a(n-1) + a(n-2) for all n > 4.
%C A351723 Conjecture 2: Let S = {x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + x*y*z: x,y,z = 0,1,2,...}.
%C A351723 (i) 7 and 487 are the only nonnegative integers which cannot be written as w^2 + s, where w is a nonnegative integer and s is an element of S. Also, 7, 87 and 267 are the only nonnegative integers which cannot be written as w^3 + s, where w is a nonnegative integer and s is an element of S.
%C A351723 (ii) Let k be 2 or 3. Then each nonnegative integer not congruent to 3 modulo 4 can be written as 4*w^k + s, where w is a nonnegative integer and s is an element of S.
%C A351723 This has been verified for nonnegative integers up to 10^6.
