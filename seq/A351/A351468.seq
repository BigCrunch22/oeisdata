%N A351468 Irregular triangle read by rows where row n is Newey's sequence containing all permutations of 1..n.
%C A351468 Row n contains n^2 - 2*n + 4 = A117950(n-1) terms, numbered as columns k >= 1. Row n contains within it all permutations of 1..n as subsequences. These subsequences need not be consecutive terms (and in general are not).
%C A351468 Newey's construction (section 6) is an initial 1..n then successive term 1 and n-2 terms from a rotating block of 2..n. The effect is term 1 at k=1, k=n+1, then steps n-1 apart, and the rest filled with repeating 2..n.
%C A351468 Koutas and Hu (equation (1)) form the same by blocks D_k(m|n) which start with 1 and then appropriate parts of rotated 2..n like Newey.
%C A351468 _Jon E. Schoenfield_ in A062714 starts from repeated 2..n and inserts 1's.
%C A351468 For n = 3 to 7, Newey shows these sequences are as short as possible (A062714) for any sequence containing all permutations, and noted the "obvious" conjecture that maybe they would be shortest always. But this is not so, since _Jon E. Schoenfield_ gives a shorter n=16 in A062714, and Radomirovic constructs shorter for all n >= 10.
