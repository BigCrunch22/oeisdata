%N A351837 Consider a variant of the toothpick sequence (A139250) where each new toothpick, except the first, touches exactly one existing toothpick at the ends, this one being in the prior stage; a(n) is the total number of toothpicks at stage n.
%C A351837 We consider toothpicks of length 1, parallel to the X and Y axes.
%C A351837 We start at stage 0 with no toothpicks.
%C A351837 At stage 1 we place one toothpick anywhere in the plane.
%C A351837 At stage n > 1, we consider all exposed ends E (i.e. in contact with no other toothpick) and attach perpendicular toothpicks in contact with E by one end provided that they won't touch other existing toothpicks (from stages 1 to n-1).
%C A351837 A toothpick added at stage n may touch other toothpicks added at stage n.
