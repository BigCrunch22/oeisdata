%N A351088 Numbers k such that A327860(k) is reachable from k by iterating the arithmetic derivative (A003415) and there are no terms with p^p-factors on the path there.
%C A351088 Sequence includes also the terms for which no iterations are needed (when k is already equal to A327860(k)), thus A328110 is a subsequence. The other terms (and also 1) seem to be the intersection of primorials (A002110) with sequence A099308. This includes terms A002110(A109628(n)), whose arithmetic derivatives are in A244622.
%C A351088 The numbers k for which A276086(k) is reachable from k by iterating A003415 form a subsequence of this sequence, but so far only one term is known: 6, for which A276086(6) = A003415(6) = 5. (See A351228). It would be interesting to know whether there are more such terms, especially terms that require more than one iteration of A003415.
%C A351088 Question: The eleven known terms are all in A276156, i.e., are repunits in primorial base. Is this a necessary property for the terms of this sequence (and also for A328110)? - _Antti Karttunen_, Feb 04 2024
