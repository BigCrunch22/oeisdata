%C A351331 Arises in studying the "Pile of pairs of coconuts (and pals)" problem.
%C A351331 Motivated by a question passed along by Timothy Hunt from Kara Goeke; it is a generalization of the exercise in the first reference, which asks for a solution for n=3. For odd-indexed terms, the index may be taken as the number of participants in the circle. (The game doesn't work for even numbers of participants.)
%C A351331 In the case in the exercise: there are three participants splitting a box of chocolates whose number is even. The first person takes one, notes that the remainder is divisible by three, takes 1/3 of the remaining chocolates, passes the remainder to the second person, who takes one, notes that the remainder is divisible by three, takes 1/3 of the remaining chocolates, and passes the remainder to the last person, who takes one, notes that the remainder is divisible by three, and takes 1/3 of the remainder. The number of chocolates remaining after this last division are once again divisible by three.
%C A351331 The generalization that this sequence solves is that there are any odd number of people n in the circle, and that they each take 1/n of the remainder after taking their initial single item; the final number left is divisible by n as well.
%C A351331 The "Pals" part is that although this only represents solutions to the problem for an odd number of participants, the formula that generates those solutions is perfectly well-behaved for even n as well, and those may as well be terms in the sequence.
%C A351331 This is the same basic problem as A002021, with the further constraint that the initial number of coconuts be even.
