%e A351298 [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7]  is a closed circuit on a square grid formed by going 1 cell up (North), 2 cells to the right (East), 3 cells up again (North), 5 cells to the right again (East), 4 cells down (South) and 7 cells to the left (West); the next smallest such circuit is given by [6, 8, 9, 10, 15, 18] as all the terms of the final sequence must be distinct; the next circuit is [11, 12, 13, 14, 24, 26], etc. Concatenating all circuits gives the sequence.
%Y A351298 Cf. A101544 (where the array has 3 columns; there are 6 columns here: if we label them a, b, c, d, e, f the terms a + c = e and b + d = f).
