%N A351614 Numbers with exactly one pair of distinct prime factors whose sum is prime.
%C A351614 Even numbers such that exactly one of its distinct prime factors is the lesser of twin primes (see A001359). For example, 70 is in the sequence since it is even and 5 is the only distinct prime factor of 70 such that 5+2 is also prime.
%e A351614 10 is in the sequence since it has exactly one pair of prime factors 2,5 which sum to a prime.
%e A351614 12 is in the sequence since it has one pair of prime factors 2,3 which sum to a prime.
%Y A351614 Cf. A001359 (lesser of twin primes).
