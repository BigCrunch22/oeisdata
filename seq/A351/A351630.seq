%N A351630 Nim values that occur at infinitely many heap sizes in the combinatorial game Mem0.
%C A351630 The impartial combinatorial game Mem0 (aka Short Local Nim) is played with heaps of tokens, as in Nim. On each turn, k tokens may be removed from a heap H, provided that k is not equal to the number of tokens that were removed on the immediately preceding move on H.
%C A351630 A heap may be denoted by n_k, where n is the number of tokens remaining and k the number removed on the preceding move. There are many nim values m that occur at just finitely many heap sizes, in the sense that G(n_k) = m for just finitely many choices of n. This sequence gives the exceptional values of m that occur at infinitely many heap sizes.
%C A351630 It is unknown whether there are infinitely many such m. It is remarkable that such simple, parameterless rules give rise to an unusual and mysterious integer sequence.
