%N A351459 Intersection of A349745 and A351458: numbers k for which k * gcd(sigma(k), A003961(k)) is equal to sigma(k) * gcd(k, A003961(k)) and also k * gcd(sigma(k), A276086(k)) is equal to sigma(k) * gcd(k, A276086(k)).
%C A351459 All 3-perfect numbers (A005820) that are even and not multiples of 3 are included in this sequence, including also any hypothetical term of the form 4u+2.
%C A351459 If A323653 is indeed a subsequence of this sequence, then there are no odd perfect numbers. - _Antti Karttunen_, Jul 17 2023
