%N A065106 Smallest Fibonacci index to produce a factor p^2 (for primes p).
%C A065106 Following Lucas, these might be called the prime-squared ranks of apparition.
%C A065106 Assuming that there are no square primitive factors in the Fibonacci sequence (an open question), then this sequence continues 1431, 1892, 2147, 2701, 2943, 3029, 3422, 3852, 4378, 4556, 4753, 4970, 5050, 5513, 6162, 6394, 6972, 7550, 7868, 8841, 8862, 9453. This is obtained by sorting the sequence prime(n)*A001602(n). - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 15 2004
%e A065106 342 is here but not in A065069 because Fib(342) is the first Fib divisible by 19^2, but 342 is divisible by 6 and so is not a primitive index.
%Y A065106 Cf. A065069, A037917, A065107.
%Y A065106 Cf. A001602 (smallest m such that prime(n) divides Fibonacci(m)).
