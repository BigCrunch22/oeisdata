%N A065399 a(n) is the greatest integer m such that (1) written in base n it is also readable as if it is in factorial base and (2) this factorial base value is smaller than or equal to m.
%C A065399 Such a number will always have the maximum allowable digit in all places that are larger in base n than in factorial base. The remaining digits can be checked sequentially, since the difference between place values in factorial base and base n increase by more than a factor of n at that point. - _Charlie Neder_, Jun 12 2019

%e A065399 We have 2221 in base 3 is equal to 79 and in factorial base is equal to 65. There is no greater number in base 3 whose factorial base interpretation is less than the number itself. So a(3)=79.
