%N A065879 a(n) is the smallest positive number that is n times the number of 1's in its binary expansion, or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A065879 a(n) is bounded above by n*A272756(n), so a program only has to check values up to that point to see if a(n) is zero. - _Peter Kagey_, May 05 2016

%e A065879 a(23) is 69 since 69 is written in binary as 1000101, 69/(1+0+0+0+1+0+1)=23 and there is no smaller possibility (neither 23 nor 46 are divisible by their number of binary 1's).
