%N A065107 Start of the permutation of the primes in the order in which p^2 first appears as a factor of a number in the Fibonacci sequence.
%C A065107 Assuming that there are no square primitive factors in the Fibonacci sequence (an open question), then this sequence continues 53, 43, 113, 73, 109, 233, 59, 107, 199, 67, 97, 71, 101, 149, 79, 139, 83, 151, 281, 421, 211, 137, 103, 157, 307, 521. This is obtained by sorting the pairs (prime(n)*A001602(n), prime(n)) by the first position and noting the order of the primes in the second position. - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 15 2004
%Y A065107 Cf. A065069, A065106.
%Y A065107 Cf. A001602 (smallest m such that prime(n) divides Fibonacci(m)).
