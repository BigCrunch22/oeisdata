%N A065907 First solution mod p of x^4 = 2 for primes p such that only two solutions exist.
%C A065907 Conjecture: no integer occurs more than three times in this sequence. Confirmed for the first 2399 terms of A007522 (primes < 100000). There are integers which do occur thrice, e.g. 221, 1159.
%F A065907 a(n) = first (least) solution mod p of x^4 = 2, where p is the n-th prime such that x^4 = 2 has only two solutions mod p, i.e. p is the n-th term of A007522.
%e A065907 a(8) = 4, since 127 is the eighth term of A007522 and 4 is the first solution mod 127 of x^4 = 2.
