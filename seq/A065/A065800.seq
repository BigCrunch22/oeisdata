%N A065800 Numbers n which, for some r, are r-digit maximizers of n/phi(n).
%C A065800 I can show that for r > 1, the first r-digit term of the sequence is the smallest r-digit primorial, if it exists. It remains to investigate the first terms when existence fails. It is also not hard to see that for r > 1, the r-digit terms are in arithmetic progression with common difference equal to the smallest r-digit term. For example, 210, 420, 630, 840 are in arithmetic progression with common difference 210. Obviously the r-digit minimizer of n/phi(n) is the largest prime of n digits.
%e A065800 30/phi(30) = 15/4 is maximal for two-digit numbers. 210/phi(210) = 35/8 is maximal for three-digit numbers.
