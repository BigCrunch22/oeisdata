%N A065670 Permutation of N induced by rotating the node 6 right in the infinite planar binary tree shown at A065658.
%H A065670 <a href="/index/Per#IntegerPermutation">Index entries for sequences that are permutations of the natural numbers</a>
%e A065670 This permutation touches only the rationals in the range ]1/2, 3/4[, which for example contains the sixth node = 3/5 of the SB ]0,1[ tree (A007305/A007306) which has an infinite, but periodic binary fractional expansion 0.100110011001... and by this permutation it is changed to 0.1010100110011001... = 53/80, which is located as the 234881023th node in the SB ]0,1[ tree.
%p A065670 [seq(RotateBinFracNodeRight(6,j),j=1..256)];
%Y A065670 The sixth row of A065658. Inverse of A065671.
