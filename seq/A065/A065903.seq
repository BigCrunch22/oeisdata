%N A065903 Integers i > 1 for which there is no prime p such that i is a solution mod p of x^4 = 2.
%C A065903 Solutions mod p are represented by integers from 0 to p-1. The following equivalences holds for i > 1: There is a prime p such that i is a solution mod p of x^4 = 2 iff i^4 - 2 has a prime factor > i; i is a solution mod p of x^4 = 2 iff p is a prime factor of i^4 - 2 and p > i. i^4 - 2 has at most three prime factors > i. For i such that i^4 - 2 has one resp. two resp. three prime factors > i; cf. A065904 resp. A065905 resp. A065906.
%F A065903 a(n) = n-th integer i such that i^4 - 2 has no prime factor > i.
%e A065903 a(2) = 1741, since 1741 is (after 1689) the second integer i for which there are no primes p > i such that i is a solution mod p of x^4 = 2, or equivalently, 1741^4 - 2 = 9187452028559 = 7*7*79*887*1609*1663 has no prime factor > 1741. (cf. A065902).
