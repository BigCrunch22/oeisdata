%N A065198 Indices of record high values in A033665, ignoring those numbers that are believed never to reach a palindrome.
%C A065198 Integers like 196, for which a palindrome is supposedly never reached, are disregarded. A065199 gives the corresponding records.
%C A065198 a(39) <= N = 12000700000025339936491 for which A033665(N) = 288, found on April 26, 2019 according to Doucette's web site. - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 16 2020
%C A065198 From _A.H.M. Smeets_, Sep 18 2021: (Start)
%C A065198 Let d_0 d_1 d_2 ... d_n be the decimal digits of an (n+1)-digit number.
%C A065198 All numbers in this sequence seem to satisfy the following condition:
%C A065198 d_0 = "1" or d_n = "9", and for all k, 0 < k < floor((n-1)/2), d_k = "0" or d_k = "9" or d_(n-k) = "0" or d_(n-k) = "9".
%C A065198 As from this, N = 12000700000025339936491, does not seem to be a record-setting number in this sequence, i.e., there must exist a smaller number N with at least a delay of 288 to reach a palindromic number. (End)

%e A065198 Starting with 89, 24 'Reverse and Add' steps are needed to reach a palindrome; starting with n < 89, fewer (at most 6, in fact) steps are needed. So 89 is a term.
