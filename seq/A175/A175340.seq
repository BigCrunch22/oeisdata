%N A175340 Numbers that can be written as a product of k consecutive composite numbers and also of k+1 consecutive composite numbers, for some k>1, with no factor used twice.
%C A175340 The term 725760 has three representations of 4, 5 and 6 numbers (with overlap).

%C A175340 a(12) > 10^22 if it exists.
%C A175340 Let x be the product of k consecutive composite numbers and y be the product of k+1 consecutive composite numbers giving some a(m). This sequence does not allow factors of x and y to overlap. If we do allow such overlaps we get A342876. (End)
%F A175340 Numbers of the form Product_{i=x..x+k} A002808(i) = Product_{i=y..y+k-1} A002808(i), where y > x + k and k > 1.

%e A175340 1814400 = 8*9*10*12*14*15 = 15*16*18*20*21 is not in the sequence as the factor 15 is used more than once.
