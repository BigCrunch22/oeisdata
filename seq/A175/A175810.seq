%N A175810 To calculate n-th term, find all shortest common superstrings of the binary representations of all natural numbers from 1 to n, read them as numbers in base-2, and pick max.
%e A175810 a(5)=52 because there are 2 shortest common superstrings of 1,10,11,100,101, they are 110100=52 and 101100=44. Pick 52 because 52>44.
