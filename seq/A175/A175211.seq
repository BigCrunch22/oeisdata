%N A175211 The finite sequence with the largest possible number of terms such that a(1) = a(2) = 1, for n >= 3, a(n) = prime p such that p = Sum_{i=1...k} a(n-i) for any k.
%C A175211 There are like shorter finite sequences with different terms: (1,1,2,3,5,11,19,41,71,131,281), (1,1,2,3,5,11,19,41,71,131,283), (1,1,2,3,5,11,19,41,79,139), (1,1,2,3,5,11,19,41,83), (1,1,2,3,5,11,23), (1,1,2,3,7,13,23,43,79), (1,1,2,3,7,13,23,43,89,181,313), (1,1,2,3,7,13,23,43,89,181,359).
%e A175211 For n=15: a(15)=4603=a(14)+a(13)+a(12)=2657+1327+619, 4603=prime.
