%N A175278 Base-6 pandigital primes: primes having at least one of each digit 0,1,2,3,4,5 when written in base 6.
%C A175278 Terms in this sequence have at least 7 digits in base 6, i.e., are larger than 6^6, since sum(d_i 6^i) = sum(d_i) (mod 5), and 0+1+2+3+4+5 is divisible by 5. So the smallest ones should be of the form "101...." in base 6, where "...." is a permutation of "2345". Actually there is only one such prime, cf. examples.

%e A175278 The smallest base-6 pandigital prime is written "1013425" in base 6.
%e A175278 The next smallest such prime is "1023345"[6]; note that here the "3" is repeated, since there is no such prime of the form "102wxyz" with w=0, 1 or 2. (Using the same reasoning as in the comment, it follows that the (7-digit base-6 pandigital) number has the same parity as the repeated digit, which therefore must be odd to get a prime.)
