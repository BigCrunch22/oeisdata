%N A175149 A positive integer n is included if (d(n),d(n+1),d(n+2)) is a permutation of three integers in arithmetic progression, where d(n) = the number of divisors of n.

%e A175149 d(10) = 4, d(11) = 2, and d(12) = 6. Now, (4,2,6) is a permutation of (2,4,6), which are three integers in arithmetic progression because 4-2 = 6-4. So 10 is included in the sequence.
