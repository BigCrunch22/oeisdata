%N A175338 Minima in cycles with Gray permutation.
%C A175338 The binary Gray code induces a permutation of the nonnegative numbers. The sequence lists the minimum of each cycle. The sequence is strictly increasing but the corresponding list of maxima (A175339) is not.
%H A175338 Joerg Arndt: <a href="http://www.jjj.de/fxt#fxtbook">Fxtbook</a>, section 2.12 "The Gray permutation", p.128ff
%e A175338 The first two cycles are the (fixed points) 0 and 1 (==> a(0) and a(1)). The third cycle is (the 2-cycle) (3,4), its minimum is 3 so a(2)=3, its maximum is 4 so A175339(2)=4. The 5th cycle is ( 8, 15, 10, 12 ) its minimum is 8 so a(4)=8, its maximum is 15 so A175339(4)=15.
%Y A175338 A175339 (cycle maxima).
