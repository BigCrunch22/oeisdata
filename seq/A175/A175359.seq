%N A175359 Let S be the set of positive integers that, when written in binary, exist as substrings in the binary representation of n. a(n) = number of partitions of n into parts that are all members of S. Each part may occur any number of times in a partition.

%e A175359 6 in binary is 110. The numerical values of the substrings of 110 are 1 (1 in binary), 2 (10 in binary), 3 (11 in binary), and 6 (110 in binary). The partitions of 6 into parts (1,2,3,6) are: 1+1+1+1+1+1, 2+1+1+1+1, 2+2+1+1, 2+2+2, 3+1+1+1, 3+2+1, 3+3, 6. There are 8 such partitions, so a(6) = 8.
