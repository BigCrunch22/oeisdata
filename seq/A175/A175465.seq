%N A175465 a(n) is the number of elements in the largest set of same-sized run-lengths (of either 0's or 1's) in the binary representation of n.
%C A175465 It is possible that two or more run-lengths may be tied for the greatest number of runs of each length.

%e A175465 1132 in binary is 10001101100. There are two runs of one digit (one run of a 0, one of a 1), three runs of two digits (one run of two 0's, two runs of two 1's), and one run of three 0's. Since the greatest number of similar-sized runs is 3 (of two digits each), then a(1132) = 3.
