%N A175075 Primes q with result 2 under iterations of {r mod (max prime p < r)} starting at r = q.
%C A175075 a(1) = 2, a(n) = A006512(n-1) for 2 <= n <= 82, a(83) = 2999. Sequence is the union of A006512 and A175080. Subsequence of A175072. Primes q with some results of {2, 28, 36, 52, 58, 66, ... } under first step of iteration of {r mod (max prime p < r)} starting at r = q, i.e. number 2 and primes q such that difference q and previous prime is equal to some of the values 2, 28, 36, 52, 58, 66, ...
%C A175075 Not the same as A094743: contains 2999, 3299, 5147, 5981, 8999, 9587, 10037, 10427, 10559, 10937, 11579, 12889, ... that are absent from that sequence. Up to 10^9, there are 3247366 terms in this sequence that are not in A094743, though every term from that sequence appears here. Is A094743 a subsequence of this sequence? - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jan 12 2022
%C A175075 It suffices to stop after the iterations yield a number less than 5 and check if the result is 2. Under this procedure, 2 takes 0 iterations, 5 is the first prime to take 1 iteration, 29 is the first to take 2 iterations, 2999 is the first to take 3 iterations, and 401429925999155063 is the first to take 4 iterations. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jan 14 2022
