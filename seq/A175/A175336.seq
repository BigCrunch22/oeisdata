%N A175336 a(1)=1. For n>1, a(n) equals the smallest number > a(n-1) of the form a(k) U j U a(k) U j, where U represents concatenation (written in decimal) of the binary representation of the arguments, where 1<=k < n, and j = {0} or {1} or {}.
%C A175336 Each term of sequence A175335 exists in this sequence.
%e A175336 10 (decimal), a term of the sequence, written in binary is 1010. Letting j={0}, we have that the decimal value of 1010 U 0 U 1010 U 0 = 1010010100, which is 660, is in the sequence.
%e A175336 Letting j = the empty string instead, and keeping a(k) = 10, we have the concatenation 1010 U 1010, which is 10101010. This is 170 in decimal, so 170 is in this sequence.
