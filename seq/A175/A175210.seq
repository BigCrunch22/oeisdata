%N A175210 a(n) = largest prime (or 1, if no such prime exists) that is < p(n) and whose binary representation occurs as a substring in the binary representation of p(n), where p(n) is the n-th prime.
%C A175210 Only a(1) and a(2) = 1.
%e A175210 29, the 10th prime, is 11101 in binary. The largest prime that is < 29 and whose binary representation occurs as a substring in this is 13 (1101 in binary), which occurs in binary 29 as follows: 1(1101). So a(10) = 13.
