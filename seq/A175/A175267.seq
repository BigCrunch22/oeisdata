%N A175267 a(n) = the minimum number of 0's that, if removed from the binary representation of n, leaves a palindrome.
%C A175267 a(2^m) = m, for all m >= 0.
%C A175267 a(2^m-1) = 0 for all m >= 0.
%C A175267 If 2^k is the largest power of 2 that divides n, then a(n) >= k.
%e A175267 20 in binary is 10100. This is not a palindrome, so a(20) > 0. Removing one 0 gets either 1100 or 1010 (the latter in two ways). Neither of these is a palindrome, so a(20)>1. But removing the last two 0's so that we have 101 does indeed leave a palindrome. So a(20) = 2.
