%N A175403 a(n) is the smallest number m requiring n iterations {((((D_1^D_2)^D_3)^D_4)^...)^D_k to reach a one-digit number starting at r = n, where D_k is the k-th digit D of the number r and k is the digit number of the number r in the decimal expansion of r (A055642)}.
%C A175403 Conjecture: sequence is finite.
%C A175403 Assuming that A020665(2) = 86, A020665(3) = 68, A020665(5) = 58 and A020665(7) = 35, a(4) is the last term; see A175402.
%e A175403 For n = 4: a(4) = 29 because 29 is the smallest number with 4 steps of defined iteration: {2^9 = 512}, {(5^1)^2 = 25}, {2^5 = 32}, {3^2 = 9}.
