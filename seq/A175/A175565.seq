%N A175565 a(n) = smallest prime > a(n-1) such that in the sum a(n-1) + a(n) there are no carries, with a(1)=2.
%C A175565 For each digit place we must have sum of digits of a(n) and a(n-1) less than 10.
%C A175565 The sequence terminates if a(n) is a prime of form 10k+9 (A030433).
%C A175565 It seems very likely that the sequence is finite for any a(1).
%C A175565 E.g., sequence with a(1)=1013 terminates at a(8060)=10000019.
%e A175565 After 5 we cannot use 7 because 5 + 7 = 12 and here 1 carries to the next digit place.
