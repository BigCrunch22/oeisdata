%N A175955 Number of ways to connect with nonintersecting chords n unlabeled points equally spaced on a circle such that the resulting configuration is not invariant w.r.t. rotation any angle < 2*Pi.
%C A175955 Also, number of chord configurations on n vertices of the period n.
%C A175955 Number of such chord configurations on 2n vertices with n chords is given by A005354(n+1).
%F A175955 For odd prime p, a(p) = (A001006(p)-1)/p = A175954(p)-1.
%e A175955 For n=2, there are only two configurations possible: two diametrically located points on a circle connected or not connected with a chord. Since both these configurations are invariant w.r.t. rotation by angle Pi, a(2)=0.
