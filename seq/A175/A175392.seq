%N A175392 a(n) is the smallest positive integer that, when written in binary, occurs in binary A154809(n) but not in binary A030101(A154809(n)).
%C A175392 A154809(n) is the n-th positive integer that is not a palindrome when written in binary.
%C A175392 A030101(n) is the decimal value of the digits of binary n written in backwards order.
%C A175392 No substring in binary n is absent from binary A030101(n) if n is a palindrome when written in binary.
%C A175392 It is immaterial if the leading 0's are included as part of A030101(A154809(n)) when checking if a particular substring is part of it, because the binary representations of all substrings begin with 1.

%e A175392 20 in binary is 10100. A030101(20) = 5, which is 00101 = 101 in binary. The positive integers that occur as substrings of 10100 when written in binary are 1 (1 in binary), 2 (10 in binary), 4 (100 in binary), 5 (101 in binary), 10 (1010 in binary), and 20 (10100 in binary). The binary substring with the largest decimal value not present in (00)101 is 100, which is 4 in decimal. So a(20) = 4.
