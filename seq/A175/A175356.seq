%N A175356 Those positive integers n where, when written in binary, there are exactly k number of runs (of either 0's or 1's) each of exactly k length, for all k where 1<=k<=m, for some positive integer m.
%C A175356 A "run" of 0's is not immediately bounded by any 0's, and a "run" of 1's is not immediately bounded by any 1's.
%C A175356 There are exactly (m*(m+1)/2)! / Product_{k=1 to m} k! numbers in the sequence each of m^3/3 + m^2/2 + m/6 binary digits, for all m >= 1, and none of any other number of binary digits.
%C A175356 A005811(a(n)) is triangular, i.e., in A000217. - _Michael S. Branicky_, Jan 19 2021
