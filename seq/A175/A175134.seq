%N A175134 a(n) = number of pairs of permutations (p, q) of the same (arbitrary) size m such that f_m(f_{m-1}(...f_1(1)...)) = n, where f_i(x) = p_i*x + q_i.
%C A175134 For a fixed m, the smallest value of f_m(f_{m-1}(...f_1(1)...)) is achieved on the pair ((m,m-1,...,1), (1,2,...,m)) and is given by A370369(m) + m = A014144(m) + m!. Hence, to compute a(n) one can restrict m to those satisfying A014144(m) + m! <= n. - _Max Alekseyev_, Jan 29 2025
%e A175134 For n = 13, suitable pairs of permutations are ((3,2,1),(1,2,3)) and ((3,2,1),(1,3,2)).
