%N A175419 The single-digit number obtained by iterated mapping of r (starting with n) to a power-tower of its digits, or -1 if such a single-digit number is never reached.
%C A175419 Define a map r->A175420(r) which takes the base-10 digits of r = sum_{i>=0} d_i*10^i and assigns the power-tower (d_0^d_1)^d_2)^d^3... to the result. There are A055642(r)-1 exponentiations in this expression. Single-digit numbers are fixed points of the map.
%C A175419 Starting with n, this map is iterated as often as needed to result in a single-digit number, which becomes a(n). In case the iteration does not reach a single-digit number (i.e., enters cycles with only multi-digit numbers), a(n)= -1.
%C A175419 The entries 1 to 9 appear infinitely often in the sequence.
%C A175419 The entry -1 appears infinitely often in the sequence, see A175426.
%C A175419 After k iterations (k >= 0) we reach the following sequences:
