%N A175107 a(1)=1. For n >= 2, if A025474(n) is the exponent of the n-th prime-power (1 is considered the first prime-power here), then a(n) = the A025474(n)th integer from among those positive integers not yet in the sequence.
%C A175107 This sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.
%e A175107 9 is the 8th power of a prime. 9 = 3^2. So we want the 2nd integer (because 2 is the exponent) from among those positive integers not in the first 7 terms of the sequence. The first 7 terms are 1,2,3,5,4,6, 9. Those positive integers not yet appearing form the infinite sequence 7,8,10,11,12,13,14,15,16... The 2nd integer not yet occurring is 8. So a(9)=8.
%Y A175107 Cf. A025474.
