%N A175021 A positive integer n is included if n is not the smallest positive integer with its particular multiset of run-lengths (of either 0 or 1 considered together) in its binary representation.
%C A175021 A175020 contains those positive integers not in this sequence.

%e A175021 9 in binary is 1001. The run lengths form the multiset (1,2,1). Since no positive integer < 9 has this same multiset of run lengths, then 9 is not in this sequence. On the other hand, 23 in binary is 10111. The run-lengths are (1,1,3). But 17 (which is < 23) in binary is 10001, which has the run-lengths of (1,3,1). Since the multisets (1,1,3) and (1,3,1) are identical, then 23 is in this sequence.
