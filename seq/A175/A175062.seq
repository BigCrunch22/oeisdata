%N A175062 An arrangement of permutations. Irregular table read by rows: Read A175061(n) in binary from left to right. Row n contains the lengths of the runs of 0's and 1's.
%C A175062 Let F(n) = sum{k=1 to n} k!. Then rows F(n-1)+1 to F(n) are the permutations of (1,2,3,...,n). (And each row in this range is made up of exactly n terms, obviously.)
%e A175062 A175061(10) = 536 in binary is 1000011000. This contains a run of one 1, followed by a run of four 0's, followed by a run of two 1's, followed finally by a run of three 0's. So row 10 consists of the run lengths (1,4,2,3), a permutation of (1,2,3,4).
