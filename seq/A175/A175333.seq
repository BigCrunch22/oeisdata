%N A175333 a(n) is the smallest prime such that (binary a(n)) OR (binary prime(n)) is one less than a power of 2.
%C A175333 By a(n) "OR" prime(n), OR the respective digits, reading right to left, of a(n) and the n-th prime written in binary.
%C A175333 Each digit of binary a(n) OR'ed with the respective (reading right to left) digit of binary prime(n) is 1.

%e A175333 19, the 8th prime, in binary is 10011. The smallest number that when written in binary and OR'ed with 10011, then it is a power of 2 minus 1, is 12 (1100 in binary). But 12 is not a prime. The next larger number that works, which is a prime, is 13 (1101 in binary). OR'ing the respective digits of 10011 and 01101 (with appropriate leading 0), from right to left, is: 1 OR 1 = 1; 1 OR 0 = 1; 0 OR 1 = 1; 0 OR 1 = 1; and 1 OR 0 = 1. Since all pairs of respective digits OR'ed equal 1 (and the resulting binary number represents a power of 2 minus 1), then a(8) = 13.
