%N A175310 Let a(0) = 1. Either, a(n) = the smallest prime not yet occurring in the sequence that, when written in binary, it is a substring in the binary representation of a(n-1); or, if no such prime exists, a(n) = the smallest prime not yet occurring that when written in binary, a(n-1) is contained as a substring within it.

%H A175310 H. Havermann, <a href="http://chesswanks.com/seq/BinaryPrimeCascade.txt">Binary Prime Cascade</a>: A 3.4 MB file of 10000 formatted binary terms. The formatting consists of aligning the coincident parts of adjacent terms. In the event of ambiguity (as happens, for example, at indices 5, 9, and 10), the subsequent term is placed - for numbers smaller than their predecessor, as far to the left as possible, and for numbers greater than their predecessor, as far to the right as possible. Currently, the Safari web-browser will not display the file as intended. The gradual drift to the left continues beyond the 10000 terms shown. [From _Hans Havermann_, Apr 10 2010]
