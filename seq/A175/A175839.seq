%N A175839 Smallest runs of n*2-1 consecutive composites.
%C A175839 Even lengths of runs of composites are omitted, as nontrivial runs always have odd lengths (see A046933).
%C A175839 Run 5 (starting at 114) has 13 consecutive composites and is repeated in runs 6 and 7. Run 8 starts at 524 = A008950(6).
