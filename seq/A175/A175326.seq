%N A175326 A positive integer n is included if the run-lengths (of runs both of 0's and of 1's) of the binary representation of n form an arithmetic progression (when written in order).
%C A175326 The difference between the lengths of consecutive runs in binary n may be either positive, 0, or negative.
%C A175326 This sequence provides a way to order all of the finite sequences each of positive integers arranged in an arithmetic progression (with common difference between consecutive integers being either positive, zero, or negative). See A175327.
