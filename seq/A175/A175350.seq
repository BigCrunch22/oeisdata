%N A175350 a(n) = the smallest positive integer not yet occurring such that the number of divisors of Sum_{k=1..n} a(k) is exactly n.
%C A175350 It seems likely that this is a permutation of the positive integers. Is it?
%F A175350 Sum_{k=1..n} a(k) = A175351(n).
%e A175350 a(4) = k where sigma(a(1) + a(2) + a(3) + k) = sigma(9 + k) = 4. The next number larger than 9 having four divisors is 10. This would give k = 1, which is in the sequence. The next number larger than 10 having four divisors is 14. This would give k = 14 - 9 = 5, which isn't already in the sequence. Therefore, a(4) = 5. - _David A. Corneth_, Mar 08 2017
