%N A175872 Write n in binary. Consider the 0's and 1 as a list. (*) If the new list consists entirely of 1's, then a(n) = the number of 1's, and end. Otherwise, construct a new list made up of the lengths, written in order, of the runs of similarly-valued terms from the previous list. Go to *.
%C A175872 n appears for the first time at A000975(n). - Sean A. Irvine and _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 02 2010
%C A175872 A217921(n) = number of steps needed to calculate a(n). - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Mar 26 2013

%e A175872 100 (decimal) in binary is 1100100. The lengths of the runs are: 2,2,1,2. The lengths of the runs in the latest list are: 2,1,1. The lengths of the runs in the latest list are: 1,2. The lengths of the runs in the latest list are: 1,1. This last list consists entirely of 1's. There are two 1's, so a(100) = 2.
