%N A175108 a(n) = number of partitions of d(n) into d(k)'s, where the k's are each <= n and distinct, but the d(k)'s need not be distinct. Here d(m) = the number of divisors of m.
%C A175108 a(n) = the coefficient of x^d(n) in the product: Product_{k=1..n} (1 + x^d(k)).
%e A175108 The first 10 terms of the number-of-divisors sequence (A000005) are 1,2,2,3,2,4,2,4,3,4. For a(10), we want the number of partitions of these 10 terms that sum to d(10)=4. We have: d(10)=4, d(8)=4, d(6)=4, d(9)+d(1) = 3+1, d(4)+d(1) = 3+1, d(7)+d(5) = d(7)+d(3) = d(7)+d(2) = d(5)+d(3) = d(5)+d(2) = d(3)+d(2) = 2+2. So there are 11 such sums (including those equal to 4 itself). Therefore a(10)=11.
