%N A049805 Triangular array T read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of Farey fractions of order n that are <= 1/k for k=1..n, for n>=1.
%C A049805 So, T(n, k) is also the index of fraction 1/k in the Farey fractions of order n. - _Michel Marcus_, Jun 27 2014
%C A049805 Start with array [1,k], and for each integer i from k+1 to n, insert i between every consecutive pair that sums to i. The length of the resulting array is T(n,k). For example, with n=5 and k=2 we have [1,2] -> [1,3,2] -> [1,4,3,2] -> [1,5,4,3,5,2] which has length 6, so T(5,2)=6. This is from a discovery of Leo Moser as described by Martin Gardner. - _Curtis Bechtel_, Oct 05 2024
