%N A049300 Smallest number starting a longest interval of consecutive integers, each of which is divisible by at least one of the first n primes.
%C A049300 The length of such longest interval of consecutive integers is given by A058989(n), which is the first maximal gaps A048670(n) minus 1 in the reduced residue system of consecutive primorial numbers.
%C A049300 Let j(m)=A048669(m) be the Jacobsthal function, i.e., the maximal distance between integers relatively prime to m. Let m=2*3*5*...*prime(n). Then a(n) is the least k>0 such that k,k+1,k+2,...,k+j(m)-2 are not coprime to m. Note that a(n) begins (or is inside) a large gap between primes. - _T. D. Noe_, Mar 29 2007

%e A049300 Between 1 and 7, all 5 numbers (2,3,4,5,6) are divisible either by 2,3 or 5. Thus a(3)=2, the initial term. Between 113 and 127 the 13 consecutive integers are divisible by 2,5,2,3,2,7,2,11,2,3,2,5,2, each from {2,3,5,7,11}. Thus a(5)=114, the smallest with this property.
