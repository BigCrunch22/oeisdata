%N A255668 Number of perfect digital invariants of order n, i.e., numbers equal to the sum of n-th powers of their digits.
%C A255668 Row lengths of the table A252648.
%C A255668 For a number with d digits, the sum of n-th powers cannot exceed d*9^n, but the number is not less than 10^(d-1). Therefore there is only a finite number of possible perfect digital invariants for any n, the largest of which has at most d* digits, where d* = 1+(n*log(9)+log d*)/log(10).

%F A255668 a(n) >= 2 for all n > 0, since 0 and 1 are digital invariants for any power n > 0.
%e A255668 a(0)=1 because 1 is the only number equal to the sum of 0th powers of its digits.
%e A255668 a(1)=10 because { 0, 1, ... 9 } are the only numbers equal to the sum of their digits (taken to the power 1).
%e A255668 a(2)=2 because 0 and 1 are the only numbers equal to the sum of the squares of their digits.
%e A255668 a(3)=6 because { 0, 1, 153, 370, 371, 407 } is the set of all numbers equal to the sum of the 3rd powers of their digits, cf. A046197.
