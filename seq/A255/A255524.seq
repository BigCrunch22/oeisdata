%N A255524 Let EKG-n denote the EKG sequence (A064413) started with n rather than 2, and suppose EKG-n first merges with some other EKG-i (i >= 2) sequence after f(n) (= A255583(n)) steps; then a(n) = smallest value of i such that EKG-i meets EKG-n after f(n) steps.
%C A255524 Does a(n) always exist?
%C A255524 See video for explanation.
%C A255524 Recommended for elementary school teachers to experiment with to teach factoring.

%e A255524 a(5) = 3 because the EKG sequence starting with 5 (EKG-5) starts coinciding with sequences EKG-3, EKG-6, EKG-9 and EKG-12 simultaneously (when all sequences hit 18).
%e A255524 EKG-3:  3, 6, 2, 4, 8, 10, 5, 15, 9, 12, 14, 7, 21, 18, 16, 20, 22, 11...
%e A255524 EKG-6:  6, 2, 4, 8, 10, 5, 15, 3, 9, 12, 14, 7, 21, 18, 16, 20, 22, 11...
%e A255524 EKG-9:  9, 3, 6, 2, 4, 8, 10, 5, 15, 12, 14, 7, 21, 18, 16, 20, 22, 11...
%e A255524 EKG-12: 12, 2, 4, 6, 3, 9, 15, 5, 10, 8, 14, 7, 21, 18, 16, 20, 22, 11...
%e A255524 EKG-5:  5, 10, 2, 4, 6, 3, 9, 12, 8, 14, 7, 21, 15, 18, 16, 20, 22, 11...
%e A255524 Of these, the smallest EKG sequence is numbered 3 so a(5) = 3.
%Y A255524 A255198 records the number of closest neighbors.
