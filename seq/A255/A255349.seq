%N A255349 Numbers n such that n(n+1) is divisible by some m(m+1) with none of {n, n+1} divisible by any of {m, m+1}.
%C A255349 A subsequence of A255346, see there for further information.

%e A255349 a(1)=20 since 20*21=420 is divisible by 14*15=210 and none of {20, 21} is divisible by any of {14, 15}.
%e A255349 a(2)=35 since 35*36 = 1260 is divisible by 14*15 = 210 (and also by 20*21 = 420).
%e A255349 69 is not in the sequence although 69*70 = 4830 is divisible by 14*15 = 210, because 14 divides 70.
