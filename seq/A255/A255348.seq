%N A255348 a(1)=1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest number not already used such that the set of prime divisors of one of the numbers {a(n-1), a(n)} is a subset of the set of prime divisors of the other.
%C A255348 The sequence is an analog of EKG-sequence A064413 with more hard condition on neighbor terms. However, we conjecture that, as A064413, it is a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A255348 By the definition, every two neighbor terms are strictly connected numbers defined in comment in A257112.
