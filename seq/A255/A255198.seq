%N A255198 Let EKG-n denote the EKG sequence (A064413) started with n rather than 2, and suppose EKG-n first merges with some other EKG-i (i >= 2) sequence after f(n) (= A255583(n)) steps; then a(n) = number of i such that EKG-i meets EKG-n after f(n) steps.
%C A255198 This sequence can be used in a classroom to introduce students to divisors.

%C A255198 EKG-5 merges with EKG-2 after three steps, so some care is needed in the definition. Perhaps the offset should be 3 rather than 2? - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 24 2015
%C A255198 Merging means that the sequences are identical for all future steps.  EKG-2 and EKG-5 merge at step 44.  From then on the sequences are identical.
%C A255198 EKG-3 and EKG-5 (below) do not merge at step 3, because the sequences are not identical from that point forward.

%e A255198 a(5) = 4 because the EKG sequence starting with 5 (EKG-5, A169841) starts coinciding with sequences EKG-3, EKG-6, EKG-9 and EKG-12 simultaneously (when all sequences hit 18).

%e A255198 a(12) = 3 because the EKG sequence starting with 12 (EKG-12, A169855) starts coinciding with sequences EKG-3, EKG-6, and EKG-9 simultaneously (when all sequences hit 14).
