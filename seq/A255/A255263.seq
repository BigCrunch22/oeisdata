%N A255263 Differences between the total number of ON cells at stage n of two-dimensional cellular automaton defined by "Rule 750" using the von Neumann neighborhood and the total number of toothpicks in the toothpick structure A139250 that are parallel to the initial toothpick, after n odd rounds.
%C A255263 It appears that the graph of A162795 lies between the graphs of A147562 and A169707.
%C A255263 It appears that a(n) = 0 if and only if n is a member of A048645.
