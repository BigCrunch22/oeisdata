%N A255392 Numbers n such that A241216(n) != A125173(n).
%C A255392 For the terms k<=161 we have A241216(k) = A125173(k) - 1.
%C A255392 Terms >= 53 are subject to the condition that including non-optimal partitions in the splitting scheme described in A241216 does not give better optimal partitions up to the last term given here.
