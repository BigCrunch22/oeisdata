%e A255058 The node 11 in the infinite trunk is A255056(11) = 30. Apart from 32, which is the next node (node 12) in the infinite trunk, it has one leaf-child 31 at the "left side" (less than 32), and one leaf-child 33 (more than 32) at the "right side", and also at that side a subtree of three nodes (34 <- 38 <- 43), starting from 34, so in total there are four branches emanating from 30, [i.e., four different k such that A236840(k) = 30], thus a(11) = 4.
%e A255058 Note that a(0) = 3, as for node zero, we count among its children the following cases A236840(2) = 0, A236840(1) = 0, and also A236840(0) = 0, with 0 being exceptionally its own child.
