%N A255372 Number of strings of n decimal digits that contain at least one string of exactly 2 consecutive "0" digits.

%F A255372 a(0) = a(1) = 0, a(2) = 1, a(n) = 9*(10^(n-3) - a(n-3) + Sum_{i=2..n-1} a(i)) for n>=3.
%F A255372 G.f.: x^2*(x-1)^2/((10*x-1)*(9*x^4-9*x^3+10*x-1)). - _Alois P. Heinz_, Feb 26 2015
%e A255372 a(2) = 1 because there is only 1 two-digit string that contains the substring "00", i.e., "00" itself.
%e A255372 a(3) = 18 because there are 18 three-digit strings that contain a "00" substring that is not part of a string of three or more consecutive "0" digits; using "+" to represent a nonzero digit, the 18 strings comprise 9 of the form "00+" and 9 of the form "+00". ("000" is excluded.)
%e A255372 a(4) = 261 because there are 261 four-digit strings that contain a "00" substring that is not part of a string of three or more consecutive "0" digits; using "+" as above and "." to denote any digit (0 or otherwise), the 261 strings comprise 9*10=90 of the form "00+.", 9*9=81 of the form "+00+", and 10*9=90 of the form ".+00".
%e A255372 a(5) = 3411 because there are 3411 five-digit strings that contain at least one "00" substring that is not part of a string of three or more consecutive "0" digits; using "+" and "." as above, the 3411 strings comprise 9*10*10=900 of the form "00+..", 9*9*10=810 of the form "+00+.", 10*9*9=810 of the form ".+00+", and 99*9=891 that are of the form "..+00" but not of the form "00+00" (since the 9 strings of that latter form were already counted among the 900 of the form "00+..").
