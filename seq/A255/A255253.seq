%N A255253 Complete list of siteswaps (indecomposable ground-state in concatenated decimal notation organized first by sum of digits and then by magnitude).
%C A255253 Siteswaping is worthy of exploration in the elementary school classroom. In my experience (Gordon Hamilton) students across a full spectrum of ability find the subject matter intriguing and the mathematics engaging.
%C A255253 By "indecomposable" we mean that the juggling state sequence associated to each loop should not return to the ground state 7 (xxx) until after the last throw.
%C A255253 By "ground state" we mean that the permutation is chosen that is as large as possible. Example: 3302 is the same as 3023 and 0233 and 2330. Only the 3302 is in the list because it is the largest number.
%C A255253 The list breaks down at term 57, which requires a digit for "10." In the classroom this can be solved by writing "10" vertically or using commas.
%e A255253 There are 13 siteswap sequences that have a digit-sum of 9. In order, these are 9, 423, 441, 450, 522, 531, 603, 612, 630, 711, 720, 801, 900.
%Y A255253 Cf. A065178, A084509, A065180.
