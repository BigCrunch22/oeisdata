%N A255617 a(n) is the smallest even term in A098550 less than 2*prime(n) but occurring after 2*prime(n); a(n)=0 if no such term exists.
%C A255617 Conjecture: for n>=5, positive a(n) > prime(n). Together with the known conjecture that, for n>=26, 2*prime(n) is the first multiple of prime(n) appearing in A098550, this conjecture would easily implies that the primes in A098550 occur in the natural order.
%C A255617 (Indeed, if 101<=P<Q, then, as known, the first multiple of P, 2*P, appears earlier than the first multiple of Q, 2*Q. By the conjecture, after 2*P there cannot appear any even number <P; thus if a(n)=2*P, then a(n+2)=P appears before 2*Q.)
