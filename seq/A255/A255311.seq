%N A255311 Decimal expansion of the prime gap constant (concatenate the sizes of prime gaps, A001223).
%C A255311 This prime gap constant is similar in spirit to the Copeland-Erd≈ës constant (A033308) and to the Champernowne constant (A033307). Its fractional part, the digits of which represent this sequence, is given as the limit of concatenating the digits (A255307) in the size of gaps between consecutive primes (A001223), while its integer part is zero by definition, as is the case with the other two constants.
%C A255311 The two other constants mentioned above are concatenation of strictly increasing numbers, which might be considered as a significant difference. At least at the beginning of this sequence, odd digits are quite rare, especially the larger ones. (The first digit '9' occurs at index n=46634.) Although prime gaps tend to increase, it is questionable whether this constant is normal, since it may be conjectured (generalizing the twin prime conjecture) that all (and especially small) gaps occur infinitely often. - _M.
