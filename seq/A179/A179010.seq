%N A179010 The number of isomorphism classes of commutative quandles of order n.
%C A179010 A quandle (X,*) is commutative if a*b = b*a for all a,b in X. Every finite commutative quandle (X,*) is obtained from an odd order, commutative Moufang loop (X,+) where x*y = (1/2)(x+y). Thus a(n) is the number of isomorphism classes of commutative Moufang loops of order n if n is odd and is 0 if n is even. Commutative Moufang loops of order less than 81 are associative hence abelian groups. But, there are two non-associative commutative Moufang loops of order 81. Thus a(n) = number of isomorphism classes of abelian groups of odd order for n < 81 and a(81) = A000688(81) + 2 = 7. For proofs of these facts see, e.g., the papers below by Belousov, Nagy and Vojtchovský, and Glauberman.
