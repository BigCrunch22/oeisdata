%N A179317 'APE(n,k)' triangle read by rows. APE(n,k) is the number of aperiodic k-palindromes of n up to cyclic equivalence.
%C A179317 A k-composition of n is an ordered collection of k positive integers (parts) which sum to n.
%C A179317 Two k-compositions of n are cyclically equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by a cyclic permutation of its parts.
%C A179317 A k-composition is aperiodic (primitive) if its period is k, or if it is not the concatenation of a smaller composition.
%C A179317 A k-palindrome of n is a k-composition of n which is a palindrome.
%C A179317 Let APE(n,k) denote the number of aperiodic k-palindromes of n up to cyclic equivalence.
%C A179317 This sequence is the 'APE(n,k)' triangle read by rows.
%C A179317 The only possibility for two distinct aperiodic palindromes to be cyclically equivalent is with an even number of terms and with a rotation by half the number of terms. For example, 123321 is cyclically equivalent to 321123. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Oct 07 2017

%e A179317 For example, row 8 is 1,0,3,1,3,1,1,0.
%e A179317 We have APE(8,3)=3 because there are 3 aperiodic 3-palindromes of 8, namely: 161, 242, and 323, and none are cyclically equivalent to the others.
%e A179317 We have APE(8,4)=1 because there are 2 aperiodic 4-palindromes of 8, namely: 3113 and 1331, but they are cyclically equivalent.
