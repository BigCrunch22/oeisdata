%N A179653 Triangular numbers (A000217) which are also primes in carryless digital root arithmetic in base 10 (A169911).
%C A179653 The complement, triangular numbers (A000217) which are not primes in carryless digital root arithmetic in base 10 (A169911), begins {1, 36, 66, 153, 171, 190, 210, 231, 253, 276, 300, 325, 351, 378, 435, 465, ...}.

%F A179653 A000217 INTERSECTION A169911.
%e A179653 1, though triangular, is a unit, not a prime, in standard or carryless arithmetic.
%e A179653 36 is triangular, A000217(8), yet not in A169911 since in carryless digital root arithmetic in base 10 we have 3*15 = 36 where both 3 and 15 are primes, and 3*18=36.
%e A179653 Similarly, 66 is triangular, A000217(11), yet not in A169911.
