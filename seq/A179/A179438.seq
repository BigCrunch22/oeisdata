%N A179438 Number of rooted trees which can be associated with each unrestricted partition.
%C A179438 Values can be calculated using simple multiplication when all the parts of a partition are unequal; however when two or more parts are equal avoid over counting by adjusting as illustrated in the example.

%e A179438 Row six of the table begins:
%e A179438 20 9 4 3 ...
%e A179438 because the partitions begin:
%e A179438 6 5+1 4+2 3+3 ...
%e A179438 and A000081 begins 1,1,2,4,9,20,...
%e A179438 the partition 3+3 has two equal terms so we write
%e A179438 2*(2+1)/2! = 3.
%e A179438 Likewise, 3+3+3 has three equal terms so the expression becomes
%e A179438 2*(2+1)*(2+2)/3!
