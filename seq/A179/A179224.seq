%N A179224 Iterative mapping with offset: a(1)=200662, a(n)=A095904(a(n-1)-1).
%C A179224 a(33) is greater than 10^10 and of the form (p^7)(q^4), where p and q are distinct primes. Of the sequences of type a(n)=A095904(a(n-1)-1), this one has an exceptionally high number of terms under 1000. It is unknown if this sequence continues indefinitely in both directions, is part of a loop, or is part of the sequence A179223.
