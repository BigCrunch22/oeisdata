%N A179684 The dimension of the space of invariant tensors in the n-th tensor power of the adjoint representation of the exceptional Lie algebra E6.
%C A179684 This is known to satisfy a linear recurrence relation with polynomial coefficients. The limit of a(n+1)/a(n) is 78.
%e A179684 The n-th tensor power is the trivial representation for n=0 and is the adjoint representation for n=1. For n=2 every invariant tensor is a scalar multiple of a Killing form.
