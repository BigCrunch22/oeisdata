%N A179806 Irregular triangle by rows, M*Q. M = triangle with (1,2,3,...) in every column, with the leftmost column shifted upwards one row. Q = a diagonalized variant of odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers.
%C A179806 Row sums = the odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers, A001519, starting with offset 1.
%C A179806 Sums of row terms = (1, 2, 5, 13, 34, 89, ...).
%C A179806 For rows > 1, sum of n-th row terms = rightmost term of next row.
%F A179806 Triangle, M*Q; where M = a triangle with (1,2,3,...) in every column with the leftmost column shifted upwards one row. Q = an infinite matrix with the odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers as the right border: (1, 2, 5, 13,...) and
%F A179806 the rest zeros.
