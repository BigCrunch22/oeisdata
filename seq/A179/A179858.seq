%N A179858 Least positive primitive root of A139035(n).
%C A179858 If p is a prime, then a is called a semiprimitive root if it has order (p-1)/2 and there is no x for which a^x is congruent to -1 (mod p). So +- a^k, 0 <= k <= (p-3)/2 is a complete set of nonzero residues (mod p). A primitive root has order p-1, so a number cannot be both a primitive root and a semiprimitive root.
%C A179858 A139035 are the primes for which 2 is a semiprimitive root. This sequence gives the smallest positive primitive root corresponding to each term of A139035, so each term is greater than or equal to 3.

%e A179858 Since A139035(13)=311, 2 is a semiprimitive root of 311 so j=0,...,154, {+-2^j} is a complete set of residues (congruent to {1,...,310}).  The corresponding member of this sequence is a(13)=17 because 17 is the smallest positive integer a for which {a^k}, k=0,...,309 is a complete set of residues.
