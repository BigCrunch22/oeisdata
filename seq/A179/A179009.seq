%N A179009 Number of maximally refined partitions of n into distinct parts.
%C A179009 Let a_1,a_2,...,a_k be a partition of n into distinct parts. We say that this partition can be refined if one of the summands, say a_i can be replaced with two numbers whose sum is a_i  and the resulting partition is a partition into distinct parts.  For example, the partition 5+2 can be refined because 5 can be replaced by 4+1 to give 4+2+1.  If a partition into distinct parts cannot be refined we say that it is maximally refined.
%C A179009 The value of a(0) is taken to be 1 as is often done when considering partitions (also, the empty partition cannot be refined).
%C A179009 This sequence was suggested by _Moshe Shmuel Newman_.

%e A179009 a(11)=2 because there are two partitions of 11 which are maximally refined, namely 6+4+1 and 5+3+2+1.
