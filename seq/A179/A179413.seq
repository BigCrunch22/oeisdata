%N A179413 The number of columns with alive cells in the n-th generation of cyclic sequence of patterns given in A179412, played in Conway's Game of Life on the 8x8 toroidal grid.
%C A179413 Period 66. The sequence begins (from offset 0) with its lexicographically earliest rotation.
%C A179413 The mean value of terms in the whole period of 66 is 6.84848.
