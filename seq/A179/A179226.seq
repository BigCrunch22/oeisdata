%N A179226 Iterative mapping with offset: a(1)=1927639, a(n)=A179216(a(n-1)-1).
%C A179226 a(18) is greater than 10^8 and of the form (p^16)qr, where p, q and r are distinct primes. Of the sequences of type a(n) = A179216(a(n-1)-1), this contains the smallest integer (11) that is part of an unknown sequence type (i.e. it is unknown if this sequence continues indefinitely in both directions, is part of a loop, or is part of the sequence A179225.)
