%N A179651 Difference between consecutive practical numbers.
%C A179651 Because the density of practical numbers is comparable to that of primes, it is natural to inquire whether certain results about prime numbers and their gaps carry over to practical numbers and their gaps. For example, it is known that lim inf a(n) = 2, which is comparable to the twin prime conjecture; and since the density of the practical numbers is zero, it follows that a(n) is unbounded. - _Hal M.
