%N A179094 Fill an n X n array with various permutations of the integers 1, 2, 3, 4... n^2. Define the organization number of the n X n array to be the following: Start at 1, count the rectilinear steps to reach 2, then the rectilinear steps to reach 3, etc. Add them up. The array that has the maximum organization number would be the "most disorganized." This sequence is the sequence showing the most disorganized number for n X n arrays starting at 1 X 1.
%C A179094 Similar to sequence A047838.
%C A179094 My computer program worked as follows:
%C A179094 a) generate a permutation
%C A179094 b) place the permutation into the array
%C A179094 c) calculate the array position (row, column) of each integer
%C A179094 d) sort the integers into another array preserving row and column
%C A179094 e) travel the new array from 1..n^2 and summing the absolute value of the differences between the rows of consecutive integers and summing the absolute value of the differences of the columns of consecutive integers. The organization number is the sum of the two sums.
%C A179094 For instance, with the permutation 8, 3, 6, 5, 9, 1, 2, 7, 4 place the integers into a 3 X 3 array as such:
%C A179094    8 3 6
%C A179094    5 9 1
%C A179094    2 7 4
%C A179094 (Notice the next integer is a knight's move away. This is not the only sequence that will give an organization number of 23, but this is why I wonder if the sequence is the same as A098499.)
%C A179094 Then sort the integers preserving their row and column:
%C A179094   number, row, column
%C A179094    1, 2, 3
%C A179094    2, 3, 1
%C A179094    3, 1, 2
%C A179094    4, 3, 3
%C A179094    5, 2, 1
%C A179094    6, 1, 3
%C A179094    7, 3, 2
%C A179094    8, 1, 1
%C A179094    9, 2, 2
%C A179094 Traveling from 1 to 9, the differences in the row numbers are 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1 (a sum of 12) and the differences in the column numbers are 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1 (a sum of 11) therefore the organization number is 23.
