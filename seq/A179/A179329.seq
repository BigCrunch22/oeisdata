%N A179329 Number of iterations of (n + lpf(n)) / 2 required to reach a prime, where lpf equals the least prime factor.
%C A179329 Zeros indicate prime indices.
%e A179329 a(15) gives (15 + 3) / 2 = 9, (9 + 3) / 2 = 6, (6 + 2) / 2 = 4, (4 + 2) / 2 = 3. Four iterations were required to reach a prime, so a(15) = 4.
%t A179329 f[n_] := Length@ NestWhileList[(# + FactorInteger[#][[1, 1]])/2 &, n, ! PrimeQ@ # &] - 1; Array[f, 105, 2]
