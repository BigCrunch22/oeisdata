%N A179310 The smallest number that has more copies of some digit than all previous terms of the sequence put together.
%C A179310 For each natural number taken in order, we consider if we can make it using digits from as many of the previous terms as we like. If we cannot, we add it to the sequence and add its digits to the 'pool' we have for making subsequent numbers.
%e A179310 This sequence is the same as A179309 up to 100. After that, we can make any three-digit number because we have had at least three of each digit so far. We can make 1000 because we have already had three 0's (in 10 and 100). So the next term is 1111 because we have only seen three 1's so far.
%Y A179310 A subsequence of A179309.
