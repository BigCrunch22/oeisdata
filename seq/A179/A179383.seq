%N A179383 a(n) = 2*k(n)-1 where k(n) is the sequence of positions of records in A179382.
%C A179383 Records in A179382(k(n)) = 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 14, 18, 26, 29, ....
%C A179383 are located at k(n) = 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 13, 15, 19, 27, 30, 31,..
%C A179383 The current sequence is a simple transformation of this k(n) sequence.
%C A179383 Question: Are there any terms in the sequence with two or more distinct prime divisors?
%C A179383 Some very plausible conjectures: 1) The sequence consists of primes and squares of primes; 2) The set of squares is finite; 3) A prime p>=5 is in the sequence iff it has primitive root 2 (A001122) ; 4) There exists l such that, for n>l, A179383(n) =A139099(n+l) .
