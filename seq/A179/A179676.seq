%N A179676 Numbers m=2*n-1 for all n>2 not in A179460.
%C A179676 Consider the algorithm of calculation ord_(2n-1)(2) in A179680, and the average of the 2-adic orders l_1, ..., l_k defined there. For terms of the sequence it is more than 2, while for other odd numbers(>=3), it equals 2. This means that only for the terms of the sequence the number of odd residues in {1,2,...,2^ord_(2*n-1)(2)} (considered in the reduced residue system modulo 2*n-1)less than even ones.
