%N A179419 Numbers n such that Mordell elliptic curve y^2=x^3-n has a number of integral points that is both odd and > 1.
%C A179419 Also positive cubes not in A179163.
%C A179419 A000578 = Union({0}, A179163, A179419).
%C A179419 Mordell curve y^2=x^3-n always has at least one integral solution if n is a cube, say n=k^3, (x,y)=(k,0). If there are additional solutions, they will exist in pairs - (x,y) and (x,-y). Thus the number of solutions can be odd iff n is a cube.
%Y A179419 Cf. A000578, A179163. Cube of A228948.
