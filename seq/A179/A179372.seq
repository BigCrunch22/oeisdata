%N A179372 a(1) = 1; a(n) = smallest positive integer not already used which has a prime signature different from a(n-1), a(n-1)+1 and a(n-1)-1.
%C A179372 A permutation of the positive integers.
%e A179372 To compute a(8), we see a(7) is 9; we look for the smallest unused positive integer that does not have the same prime signature as either 8, 9 or 10. The first such number is 2.
