%N A179897 Numbers a_n with property that a(n) is arithmetic mean of sequence "n-times n^-1, once n^(2*n+1)" that has integer valued both arithmetic and geometric means even though some of the sequence members are (for n>1) non-integer.
%C A179897 According to search at OEIS for particular sequence members, a(n) is also: (1+2*n)-th q-integer for q=-n, (2*(n+1))-th cyclotomic polynomial at q=-n, Gaussian binomial coefficient [2*n+1, 2*n] for q=-n, number of walks of length 1+2*n between any two distinct vertices of the complete graph K_(n+1).

%F A179897 a(n) = (n^(2*n+1) + 1) / (n+1). a(n) = \sum_{i=0}^{2*n} (-n)^i.
%e A179897 For n = 2 the a(2) = 11 since arithmetic mean of (1/2, 1/2, 2^5) is 33 / 3 = 11 where its geometric mean is 8^(1/3) = 2, i.e. both are integral.

%Y A179897 Values for n = 5, 6 via other ways. Q-integers: A014986, A014987, K_n paths: A015531, A015540, Cyclotomic polynomials: A020504, A020505, Gaussian binomial coefficients: A015391, A015429.
