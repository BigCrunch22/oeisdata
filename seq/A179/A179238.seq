%N A179238 Numerators in convergents to infinitely repeating period 3 palindromic continued fraction [1,2,1,...].
%C A179238 If n == 2 (mod 3), a(n) is in A179237, prefaced with a 1: (1, 2, 13, 80, 493, ...).
%C A179238 Conjecture relating palindromic continued fractions to the tangents of angles A and 2A:
%C A179238 Tan 2A is rational when tan(A) is irrational, iff tan(A) is a convergent to an infinitely repeating palindromic continued fraction.
%C A179238 Conversely, if tan(A) is such a convergent, then tan(2A) must be rational.
%C A179238 The conjecture applies to any palindromic form such as [a,a,a,...], [a,b,a,a,b,a,...], [a,b,b,a,a,b,b,a,...], [a,b,c,c,b,a,...] and so on.

%C A179238 Tan(2) corrected to tan(A), which is the half angle of a right triangle with sides (a, b) and c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2), not an integer. Example: Given a right triangle with sides a = 3, b = 5, c = sqrt(34), we calculate the two acute angles 2A and divide each by two, giving us two angles A; then perform tan(A) on each. These have an algebraic equivalency of two constants: 3/(5 + sqrt(34)) = 0.276983964... and 5/(3 + sqrt(34)) = 0.566190378... The continued fraction representations of these constants are respectively barover[3,1,1,1,1,3] and barover[1,1,3,3,1,1], both palindromic. The conjecture and proof don't apply to Pythagorean triangles, in which case the tangents of the half angles would be rational. - _Gary W. Adamson_, Apr 07 2014

%e A179238 Examples relating to the conjecture: Since A179238 has two recursive multipliers, we can extract the sequence A179237: (1, 2, 13, 80, 493, 3038,...) = convergents of A179238 such that a(n+1) = 2*a(n) + a(n-1). The convergent of this sequence = 1/(sqrt(10) - 3) = 6.16227766, ... = a, where 1/a = 0.1622776, ... the convergent to the palindromic continued fraction [6,6,6,...]. Then letting 1/a = tan(A), then tan(2A) = 1/3, rational. Similarly, taking a = 6.16227766, ... = tan(A), then tan(2A) = -1/3, rational, with a and 1/a irrational.
