%N A179993 Numbers m with the property that, when a and b are positive integers such that a*b = m, |a-b| is prime.
%C A179993 All numbers in this sequence are congruent to 0 or 2 mod 3.
%C A179993 It is not known if this sequence is infinite. For n > 1 all terms are even.
%C A179993 The intersection with A080715 seems to be empty. Is this provable ?
%C A179993 From _Amiram Eldar_, Nov 15 2021: (Start)
%C A179993 The nonsquarefree terms of this sequence, 8, 18, 98, 338, ..., are numbers of the form 2*p^2, where p is in A349327.
%C A179993 The least terms with 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 distinct prime divisors are 3, 14, 138, 390 and 13576178, respectively. Are there terms with more than 5 distinct prime divisors? (End)
%C A179993 All terms have either 6 (for a(n) = 2*A349327^2) or 2^k (for a(n) in A005117) divisors. - _Samuel Harkness_, Mar 02 2023
