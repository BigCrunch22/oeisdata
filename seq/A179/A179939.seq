%N A179939 Largest semiprime divisor of all composite numbers between semiprime(n) and semiprime(n+1), or 0 if there are none.
%C A179939 This is to A052248 as semiprimes (A001358) are to primes (A000040). This defines a mapping f from semiprimes to semiprimes or 0 and f(s) < s holds for all semiprimes s. There is a block of k-1 consecutive 0's corresponding to each block of k consecutive semiprimes (i.e., a block of two consecutive 0's starting at the least of the triples in A115394).

%F A179939 a(n) = max_{A001358(n) < k < A001358(n+1)} A179312(k).
%e A179939 a(1) = 0 because there are no composite numbers between the 1st semiprime 4 and the 2nd semiprime 6.
%e A179939 a(2) = 4 because the composite numbers between the 2nd semiprime 6 and the 3rd semiprime 9 are {8} which is divisible by the semiprime 4=2*2.
%e A179939 a(10) = 15 because the composite numbers between the 10th semiprime 26 and the 11th semiprime 33 are {27, 28, 30, 32} of which the maximum is found for 30 which is divisible by the semiprime 15=3*5.
