%N A336324 The power sandwiches sequence, version 1 (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A336324 Imagine we would have a pair of adjacent integers in the sequence like [1951, 2020]. The sandwich would then be made of the rightmost digit R of a(n), the leftmost digit L of a(n+1) and, in between, L^R. The pair [1951, 2020] would then produce the power sandwich 122. Please note that the pair [2020, 1951] would produce the power and genuine sandwich 011 (we keep the leading zero: these are sandwiches after all, not integers).
%C A336324 Now we want the sequence to be the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms such that the successive sandwiches emerging from the sequence rebuild it, digit after digit.

%e A336324 The first successive sandwiches are: 122, 242, 2164, 4162, 166, 640964, ...
%e A336324 The first one (122) is visible between a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 2; we get the sandwich by inserting 2^1 = 2.
%e A336324 The second sandwich (242) is visible between a(2) = 2 and a(3) = 22; we get this sandwich by inserting 2^2 = 4 between 2 and 2.
%e A336324 The third sandwich (2164) is visible between a(3) = 22 and a(4) = 4; we get this sandwich by inserting 4^2 = 16 between 2 and 4; etc.
%e A336324 The successive sandwiches rebuild, digit by digit, the starting sequence.
%Y A336324 Cf. A336325 (same idea, but between L and R we insert R^L instead of L^R), A335600 (poor sandwiches), A335854 (digital-root sandwiches), A335886 (heavy sandwiches).
