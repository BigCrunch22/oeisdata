%N A336904 The natural sandwiches sequence (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A336904 Imagine we would have a pair of adjacent integers in the sequence like [1951, 2020]. The sandwich would then be made of the rightmost digit of a(n), the leftmost digit of a(n+1) and, in between, the smallest natural number N not yet inserted into a sandwich. The pair [1951, 2020] would then produce the natural sandwich 1N0. Please note that the pair [2020, 1951] would produce the genuine sandwich 0N1 (we keep the leading zero: these are sandwiches after all, not integers).
%C A336904 Now we want the sequence to be the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms such that the successive sandwiches emerging from the sequence rebuild it, digit after digit.

%e A336904 The first successive sandwiches are: 112, 222, 232, 342, 354, 462,...
%e A336904 The 1st one (112) is visible between a(1) = 11 and a(2) = 2; we get the sandwich by inserting 1 between 1 and 2.
%e A336904 The 2nd sandwich (222) is visible between a(2) = 2 and a(3) = 22; we get this sandwich by inserting 2 between 2 and 2.
%e A336904 The 3rd sandwich (232) is visible between a(3) = 22 and a(4) = 223; we get this sandwich by inserting 3 between 2 and 2;
%e A336904 The 4th sandwich (342) is visible between a(4) = 223 and a(5) = 23; we get this sandwich by inserting 4 between 3 and 2; etc.
%e A336904 The successive sandwiches rebuild, digit by digit, the starting sequence.
%Y A336904 Cf. A335600.
