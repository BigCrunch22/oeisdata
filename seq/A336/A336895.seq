%N A336895 The prime sandwiches sequence (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A336895 Imagine we would have a pair of adjacent integers in the sequence like [1951, 2020]. The sandwich would then be made of the rightmost digit of a(n), the leftmost digit of a(n+1) and, in between, the smallest prime p not yet inserted in a sandwich. The pair [1951, 2020] would then produce the sandwich 1p2. Please note that the pair [2020, 1951] would produce the genuine sandwich 0p1 (we keep the leading zero: these are sandwiches after all, not integers).
%C A336895 Now we want the sequence to be the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms such that the successive sandwiches emerging from the sequence rebuild it, digit after digit.

%e A336895 The first successive sandwiches are: 122, 232, 253, 372, 5113, 3137,...
%e A336895 The 1st one (122) is visible between a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 22 (insert 2).
%e A336895 The 2nd one (232) is visible between a(2) = 22 and a(3) = 2 (insert 3).
%e A336895 The 3rd one (253) is visible between a(3) = 2 and a(4) = 3 (insert 5).
%e A336895 The 4th one (372) is visible between a(4) = 3 and a(5) = 225 (insert 7).
%e A336895 The 5th one (5113) is visible between a(5) = 225 and a(6) = 33 (insert 11); etc.
%e A336895 The successive sandwiches rebuild, digit by digit, the starting sequence.
%Y A336895 Cf. A336894 (empty sandwiches), A335600 (poor sandwiches).
