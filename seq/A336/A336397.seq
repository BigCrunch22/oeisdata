%N A336397 Numbers k such that both k and A122111(k) [its conjugated prime factorization] are Ore's Harmonic numbers (A001599).
%C A336397 The initial four terms were found from the b-file of 937 terms provided in A001599.
%C A336397 There also at least these additional terms present: 439151400324000, 889013810412000, 106713790278732000, that were found from the file of conjectured initial 10000 terms of A001599 provided by _David A. Corneth_ under that entry. However, there might be further terms in the range between.
%C A336397 Note that A122111(889013810412000) = 106713790278732000, and vice versa, which proves that the intersection of A001599 and A088902 (equal to the intersection of A088902 with A336317) is not equal to this sequence, but just a proper subsequence.
