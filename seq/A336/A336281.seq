%N A336281 Total number of ways of embedding connected graphs with n edges in the square lattice with diagonals allowed.
%C A336281 The embedding must map edges in the graph onto either horizontal or vertical grid lines of length 1 or diagonals of length sqrt(2). Vertices in the graph must map onto lattice points, and of course must preserve the incidence structure of the graph. A square in the lattice may have both diagonals present - their intersection does not count as an incidence.
%C A336281 Configurations differing only a rotation or reflection are not counted as different.
%C A336281 The resulting figures are variously called 'polysticks', 'polyedges' or 'polyforms'.

%Y A336281 Without diagonal edges, we get A019988.
