%N A336826 Bogotá numbers: numbers k such that k = m*p(m) where p(m) is the digital product of m.
%C A336826 Named Bogotá numbers by Tomás Uribe and Juan Pablo Fernández based on similarity of the construction to the Colombian numbers (A003052).
%C A336826 Some questions about these numbers:
%C A336826 (i) Some Bogotá numbers occur in pairs (such as 24 and 25). Are there infinitely many such pairs?
%C A336826 (ii) More generally, can arbitrarily long sets of consecutive numbers be found all of which are Bogotá numbers?
%C A336826 (iii) Can the gap between two consecutive Bogotá numbers be arbitrarily large? Answer: Yes.

%C A336826 The only primes in this sequence are A004022.
%C A336826 To see if a number is a Bogotá number, we only have to look at its 7-smooth divisors. Proof: If a number k is a Bogotá number then k = m*p(m) where p(m) is 7-smooth as it's a product of digits. Furthermore, if k = m*p(m) then p(m) | k. Q.e.d. Below is an example using this idea.
%C A336826 To find Bogotá numbers k up to N we can make a list of 7-smooth numbers up to sqrt(N) and list the factorizations into single-digit numbers of each of these 7-smooth numbers that when concatenated give m such that m * p(m) = k where p(m) is that 7-smooth number.
%C A336826 For example, 10 is a 7-smooth number. Its factorizations into single-digit numbers are 2*5, 5*2, 1*2*5 and so on. This tells us that 10*25 = 250, 10*52 = 520, 10*125 = 1250 all are Bogotá numbers.
%C A336826 Similarily we can find odd Bogotá numbers to then find consecutive Bogotá numbers (See A336864). (End)

%e A336826 520 is a term because 52 * p(52) = 52 * 10 = 520.
%e A336826 Example using we only have to look at 7-smooth divisors:
%e A336826 520 is a term as its 7-smooth divisors d are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40. values 520/d are 520, 260, 130, 104, 65, 52, 26, 13 of which 52 * (5*2) = 520 where (5*2) are the products of 52. (End)
