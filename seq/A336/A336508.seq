%N A336508 Numbers m such that every number 1 <= k <= s is the sum of a subset of the set {lambda(d) : d | m}, where s is the total sum of the set and lambda is the Carmichael lambda function (A002322).
%C A336508 Schwab and Thompson (2018) named these numbers "lambda*-practical". The asterisk in the terminology was chosen to emphasize that this notion differs from the definition of lambda-practical numbers (A336506).
%C A336508 This sequence is in fact a subsequence of the lambda-practical numbers. Lambda-practical numbers that are not in this sequence are 100, 156, 208, 255, 272, 294, 380, 392, 408, 456, 500, ...
%C A336508 The number of terms of this sequence that do not exceed 10^k for k = 1, 2, ... are 6, 28, 164, 1015, 7128, 52326, 409714, ...

%e A336508 6 is a term since the values of the Carmichael lambda function at its divisors, {1, 2, 3, 6}, are {1, 1, 2, 2}, and every number 1 <= k <= 6 is a sum of elements of this set: 1 = 1, 2 = 2, 3 = 1 + 2, 4 = 2 + 2, 5 = 1 + 2 + 2 and 6 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2.
