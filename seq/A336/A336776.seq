%N A336776 a(n) is the least number of repetitions such that the result of the repeated execution of the multiplication f <- f*n started at f=1 produces an overflow, when the multiplication is performed using 32-bit single precision floats according to the IEEE 754 standard.
%C A336776 See A336774 for more information and links.
%C A336776 The overflow usually raises the corresponding exception, with +infinity returned as result.
