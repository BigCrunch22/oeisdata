%N A336668 Numbers with decimal expansion d_1, ..., d_w such that d_k = d*_{k + d_k} for k = 1..w where d* is the w-periodic sequence with initial terms d_1, ..., d_w.
%C A336668 In other words, arranging the decimal digits of a term clockwise around a circle, any digit d, say at position p, appears at position p + d (or equivalently at position p - d).
%C A336668 All repunits (A002275) appear in this sequence, and they are the only terms with a digit 1.
%C A336668 All numbers with repeated digits (A010785) also appear in this sequence.
%C A336668 If m > 0 belongs to the sequence, then A020338(m) and A074842(m) also belong to the sequence.

%e A336668 We can arrange the decimal digits of 46064686 around a circle as follows:
%e A336668 .               4
%e A336668 .         6           6
%e A336668 .
%e A336668 .
%e A336668 .      8                 0
%e A336668 .
%e A336668 .
%e A336668 .         6           6
%e A336668 .               4
%e A336668 - moving clockwise:
%e A336668    - the digit 4 in the north leads to the digit 4 in the south and vice versa,
%e A336668    - the digit 6 in the northeast leads to the digit 6 in the northwest,
%e A336668    - the digit 6 in the northwest leads to the digit 6 in the southwest,
%e A336668    - the digit 6 in the southwest leads to the digit 6 in the southeast,
%e A336668    - the digit 6 in the southeast leads to the digit 6 in the northeast,
%e A336668    - the digit 0 leads to itself,
%e A336668    - the digit 8 leads to itself (after a full turn),
%e A336668 - so 46064686 belongs to this sequence.
