%N A336597 a(n) is the least number k of the form (the number of nonnegative bases m < n such that m^k == m (mod n))/(the number of nonnegative bases m < n such that -m^k == m (mod n)) dividing n, or 0 if no such k exists.
%C A336597 Conjecture: For each natural number n, either there is a divisor k of the form (the number of nonnegative bases m < n such that m^k == m (mod n))/(the number of nonnegative bases m < n such that -m^k == m (mod n)) and it is unique, or it does not exist.
%C A336597 This has been checked up to at least 10^3.
