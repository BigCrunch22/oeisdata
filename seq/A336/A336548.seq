%N A336548 Numbers k such that at least one pair sigma(p_i^e_i), sigma(p_j^e_j) [with i != j] share a prime factor, when k = p_1^e_1 * ... * p_h^e_h, where each p_i^e_i is the maximal power of prime p_i dividing k.
%C A336548 Numbers k for which A353802(k) = Product_{p^e||k} A051027(p^e) > A051027(k), i.e. numbers at which points A051027 is not multiplicative. The notation p^e||k means that p^e divides k, but p^(1+e) does not.
%C A336548 If x is present, then also multiples y*x are present for all y for which gcd(x,y) = 1.
%C A336548 Also numbers at which points A062401 and A353750 are not multiplicative. - _Antti Karttunen_, May 09 2022

%e A336548 10 = 2*5 is present as sigma(2) = 3 and sigma(5) = 6, and 3 and 6 share a prime factor (gcd(3,6) = 3). Also we see that sigma(sigma(2))*sigma(sigma(5)) = 4*12 = 48 > sigma(sigma(10)) = 39.
