%N A336317 Numbers k such that A122111(k) [conjugated prime factorization of k] is one of Ore's Harmonic numbers (in A001599).
%C A336317 Numbers k for which A336314(k) = A323173(k).
%C A336317 Sequence A122111(A001599(n)), n >= 1, sorted into ascending order. Positions of zeros in A323174 (corresponding to perfect numbers similarly mapped) is a subsequence.
%C A336317 Note that all terms after 1 seem to be present in A102750. This observation is equal to Ore's conjecture that there are no odd Harmonic numbers larger than one.
%C A336317 Also, all terms after 1 seem to be even, which would imply that apart from its initial 1, A001599 were a subsequence of A102750. However, this is false, as there are terms of A001599 not in A102750, for example 8011798098793361832960 found by _David A. Corneth_. Note that A122111(8011798098793361832960) = 96922193555635754403846044921625, which is thus an odd term of this sequence.
