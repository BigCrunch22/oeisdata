%N A336894 The empty sandwiches sequence (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A336894 Imagine we would have a pair of adjacent integers in the sequence like [1951, 2020]. The sandwich would then be made of the rightmost digit of a(n), the leftmost digit of a(n+1) and, in between, some combination c of those two digits (see A335600 for instance). The pair [1951, 2020] would then produce the sandwich 1c2. Please note that the pair [2020, 1951] would produce the genuine sandwich 0c1 (we keep the leading zero: these are sandwiches after all, not integers).
%C A336894 In this sequence we don't insert anything between the two "slices of bread": there is no c, the sandwiches are empty.
%C A336894 Now we want the sequence to be the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms such that the successive sandwiches emerging from the sequence rebuild it, digit after digit.

%e A336894 The first successive sandwiches are: 12, 22, 22, 03, 33, 33, 04,...
%e A336894 The 1st one (12) is visible between a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 2.
%e A336894 The 2nd one (22) is visible between a(2) = 2 and a(3) = 22.
%e A336894 The 3rd one (22) is visible between a(3) = 22 and a(4) = 220.
%e A336894 The 4th one (03) is visible between a(4) = 220 and a(5) = 3; etc.
%e A336894 The successive sandwiches rebuild, digit by digit, the starting sequence.
%Y A336894 Cf. A335600.
