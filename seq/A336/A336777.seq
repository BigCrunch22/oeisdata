%N A336777 a(n) is the least number of repetitions such that the result of the repeated execution of the division f <- f/n started at f=1 produces 0, when the division is performed using 32-bit single precision floats according to the IEEE 754 standard.
%C A336777 See A336774 for more information and links.
%C A336777 In contrast to multiplication (A336776), a larger range of values can be used in division by using leading zeros in the significands. The underflow gap is filled by using denormal numbers, also called subnormal numbers.
