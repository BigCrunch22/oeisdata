%N A336827 a(n) is the largest integer that can be written in two bases smaller than n as mutually-reversed strings of digit(s), for n>=4.
%e A336827 a(5) is 22 because 22 = 211 (base 3) = 112 (base 4) is the largest such integer with both bases < 5 (here 3 and 4).
%e A336827 a(6) is also 22 because there are no larger such integers with both bases < 6.
%e A336827 a(7) is 9831 because 9831 = 303311 (base 5) and 113303 (base 6) is the largest such integer with both bases < 7 (here 5 and 6).
