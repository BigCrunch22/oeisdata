%N A336590 Numbers k such that k/A008834(k) is squarefree, where A008834(k) is the largest cube dividing k.
%C A336590 Numbers such that none of the exponents in their prime factorization is of the form 3*m + 2.
%C A336590 Cohen (1962) proved that for a given number k >= 2 the asymptotic density of numbers whose exponents in their prime factorization are of the forms k*m or k*m + 1 only is zeta(k)/zeta(2). In this sequence k = 3, and therefore its asymptotic density is zeta(3)/zeta(2) = 6*zeta(3)/Pi^2 = 0.7307629694... (A253905).
%C A336590 Also, numbers k whose number of divisors, A000005(k), is not divisible by 3, i.e., complement of A059269.
