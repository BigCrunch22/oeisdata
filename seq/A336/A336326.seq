%N A336326 a(n) is the least k > 0 such that A000217(k) is divisible by n+k, except a(2) = 0.
%C A336326 a(2) = 0 as there is no k > 0 such that A000217(k) is divisible by k+2 (Proof: Suppose a(2) = k > 0. Then z = (k*(k+1)/2)/(k+2) is an integer. Notice that z = (k*(k+1)/2)/(k+2) = (k-1)/2 + 1/(k+2). Let (k-1)/2 = m, 1/(k+2) = t. Since k-1 is an integer, either m or m + 1/2 is also an integer. Since z = m+t and z is an integer, either t or t + 1/2 is an integer. However, for any k > 0, we have t < 1/2 and t > 0, so neither t nor t + 1/2 is an integer, which is a contradiction. Hence, there is no k > 0 such that a(2) = k).

%F A336326 a(n) = Min_{k>0} (1/2) * (k-n+1+n*(n-1)/(k+n)) is an integer.
%e A336326 a(9) = 15, because A000217(15) (i.e., the 15th triangular number: 120) is divisible by 15+9 (indeed, 120/(15+9) = 120/24 = 5) and there is no other k > 0 and < 15 such that A000217(k) is divisible by k+9.
