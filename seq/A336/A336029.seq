%N A336029 Given the two curves y = (1 - exp(x/2))/(exp(x) + exp(x/2)) and y = (exp(-x) - 1)/2, draw a line tangent to both. This sequence is the decimal expansion of the y-coordinate (negated) of the point at which the line touches y = (exp(-x) - 1)/2.
%C A336029 This constant is involved in the calculation of Gauchman's constant -A243261 (which equals A086278 - 1).
%C A336029 Gauchman's constant is the point where the common tangent to the two curves y = (1 - exp(x/2))/(exp(x) + exp(x/2)) and y = (exp(-x) - 1)/2 intersects the y-axis.

%F A336029 We solve the following system of equations:
%F A336029 exp(-c) = (exp(b/2) + 2*exp(b) - exp(3*b/2))/(exp(b) + exp(b/2))^2 and
%F A336029 2*(1 - exp(b/2)) = (exp(b) + exp(b/2))*(exp(-c)*(1 + c - b) - 1).
%F A336029 Then the constant equals C = (exp(-c) - 1)/2.
%F A336029 It turns out that b = -A335810 = -0.387552... and c = A335809 = 0.330604... even though A335810 and A335809 are also involved in the calculation of the Shapiro cyclic sum constant mu (A086278).
%F A336029 As a result, the constant C equals A335822 - 1.
%F A336029 Gauchman's constant = -A243261 = C - (C + 1/2)*log(2*C + 1).
%F A336029 Shapiro cyclic sum constant mu = A086278 = 1 + C - (C + 1/2)*log(2*C + 1).
