%N A336362 Number of iterations of map k -> k*sigma(p^e)/p^e needed to reach a power of 2, where p is the smallest odd prime factor of k and e is its exponent, when starting from k = n. a(n) = -1 if number of the form 2^k is never reached.
%C A336362 Informally: starting from k=n, keep on replacing p^e, the maximal power of the smallest odd prime factor in k, with (1 + p + p^2 + ... + p^e), until a power of 2 is reached. Sequence counts the steps needed.

%F A336362 If A209229(n) = 1 [when n is a power of 2], a(n) = 0, otherwise a(n) = 1 + a(sigma(A336650(n))*(n/A336650(n))).
%F A336362 a(n) = a(2n) = a(A000265(n)).
%e A336362 For n = 15 = 3*5, we obtain the following path, when starting from k = n, and when we always replace the maximal power of the lowest odd prime factor, p^e of k with sigma(p^e) = (1 + p + p^2 + ... + p^e) in the prime factorization k: 3^1 * 5^1 -> (1+3)*5 = 20 = 2^2 * 5 -> 4 * (1+5) = 24 = 2^3 * 3^1 -> 2^3 * 2^2 = 2^5, thus it took three iterations to reach a power of two, and a(15) = 3.
