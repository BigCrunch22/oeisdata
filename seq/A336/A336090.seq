%N A336090 Number of k's, 1 <= k <= n, such that the continued fraction for n^2/k^2 has twice as many elements as the continued fraction for n/k.
%C A336090 Conjecture: a(n) >= 1 for n >= 15.
%F A336090 Conjecture: a(n) << n/log(n) (see links for the graph of a(n)/n*log(n)).
%F A336090 Does the limit of a(n)*log(n)/n as n tends to infinity exist?
