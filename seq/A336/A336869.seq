%N A336869 Number of divisors d of n! with distinct prime multiplicities such that the quotient n!/d also has distinct prime multiplicities.
%C A336869 Does this sequence converge to zero?
%C A336869 A number has distinct prime multiplicities iff its prime signature is strict.
%C A336869 From _Edward Moody_, Jan 18 2021: (Start)
%C A336869 a(n) = 0 for n >= 17.
%C A336869 Proof: 17 is the third Ramanujan prime (A104272). Therefore, for n>=17, there are at least three primes greater than n/2 and less than or equal to n. These primes must have exponent 1 in the prime factorization of n!, therefore, at least two of them must have exponent 1 in the prime factorization of either d or n!/d, so d and n!/d cannot both have distinct prime multiplicities.
