%N A336542 Primitive integers for the number of ways k to write as a sum of two squares.
%C A336542 The number of ways to write k as a number of two squares only depends on the parity of the multiplicity of 2, the parity of the multiplicity of a prime of the form 4*m + 3 and the multiplicity of a prime of the form 4*m+1 (See A025426). Terms in this sequence have no prime factors of the form 4*m + 3.
