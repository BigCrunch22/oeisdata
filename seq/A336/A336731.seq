%N A336731 Three-column table read by rows: row n gives [number of triangle-triangle, triangle-quadrilateral, quadrilateral-quadrilateral] contacts for a row of n adjacent congruent rectangles divided by drawing diagonals of all possible rectangles (cf. A331452).
%C A336731 For a row of n adjacent rectangles the only polygons formed when dividing all possible rectangles along their diagonals are 3-gons (triangles) and 4-gons (quadrilaterals). Hence the only possible edge-sharing contacts are 3-gons with 3-gons, 3-gons with 4-gons, and 4-gons with 4-gons. This sequence lists the number of these three possible combinations for a row of n adjacent rectangles. Note that the edges along the outside of the n adjacent rectangles are not counted as they are only in one n-gon.
%C A336731 These are graphs T(1,n) described in A331452. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 03 2020

%F A336731 Sum of row t = A331757(t) - 2(t + 1).
%e A336731 a(1) = 4, a(2) = 0, a(3) = 0. A single rectangle divided along its diagonals consists of four 3-gons, four edges, and no 4-gons. Therefore there are only four 3-gon-to-3-gon contacts. See the link image for n = 1.
%e A336731 a(4) = 14, a(5) = 8, a(6) = 0. Two adjacent rectangles divided along all diagonals consists of fourteen 3-gons and two 4-gons. The two 4-gons are separated and thus share all their edges, eight in total, with 3-gons. There are fourteen pairs of 3-gon-to-3-gon contacts. See the link image for n = 2.
%e A336731 a(7) = 20, a(8) = 48, a(9) = 4. Three adjacent rectangles divided along all diagonals consists of thirty-two 3-gons and fourteen 4-gons. There are two groups of three adjacent 4-gons, so there are four 4-gons-to-4-gon contacts. These, along with the other 4-gons, share 48 edges with 3-gons. There are also twenty 3-gon-to-3-gon contacts. See the link image for n = 3.
