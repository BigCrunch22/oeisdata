%N A336301 Binary sequence of itself (minus signs are delimiters, see the Comments section for explanations).
%C A336301 Replace all even terms by a 0, odd terms by a 1. Consider now the minus signs as chunks' delimiters of concatenated 1's and 0's. The successive chunks are the binary equivalents of the sequence's term. This is the lexicographically earliest sequence having this property.
