%N A336664 Number of distinct divisors d of n with the property that d = (the number of nonnegative bases m < n such that m^k == m (mod n))/(the number of nonnegative bases m < n such that -m^k == m (mod n)) for some nonnegative k.
%C A336664 For any k >= 0, the value of (the number of nonnegative bases m < n such that m^k == m (mod n))/(the number of nonnegative bases m < n such that -m^k == m (mod n)) is the value of some part of n, and is equal or unequal to the value of some divisor of n. Starting with k = 2, these infinite sequences of the parts of n are periodic with a period equal to A002322(n) (or A000010(n)). Also these sequences are different, but among n there are pairs of numbers (1 and 2, 3 and 6, ...) for which they are the same.
%C A336664 For n >= 1, minimal d is equal to 1 and maximal d is equal to A026741(n).
%C A336664 If n: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 17, 30, 34, 51, 85, 102, ..., then d = (the number of nonnegative bases m < n such that m^k = m)/(the number of nonnegative bases m < n such that -m^k = m) for all nonnegative k.
