%N A336785 Consider the rectangular regions in the Even Conant Lattice; let S(0) be the singleton with the square at the origin, and for any n >= 0, let S(n+1) be the set of rectangular regions adjacent to some region in S(n) that are not found in S(0) U ... U S(n); a(n) is the number of regions in S(n).
%C A336785 See A328078 for more information.
%C A336785 Two regions are considered adjacent if they share a common edge portion of size >= 1.
%C A336785 This is the coordination series (with respect to the point at the origin) for the dual graph to the graph of the Even Conant Lattice. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 20 2020
