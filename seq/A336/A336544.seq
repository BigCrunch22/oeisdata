%N A336544 Sum over all unlabeled graphs of order n, of the number of graphs obtainable by deletion of a single vertex in the graph.
%C A336544 For a graph G with n vertices, consider deleting each vertex in turn (along with any associated edges). The resulting graphs will have n-1 vertices. Count the distinct graphs reached. This sequence gives the sum of this count over all graphs with n vertices.
