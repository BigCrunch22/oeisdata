%N A336789 Incrementally largest values of minimal y satisfying the equation x^2 - D*y^2 = 2, where D is a prime number.
%e A336789 For D=2, the least y for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 2 has a solution is 1. The next primes, D, for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 2 has a solution are 7 and 23, but the smallest y in each of these cases is also 1, which is equal to the previous record y. So 7 and 23 are not terms of A336788.
%e A336789 The next prime, D, after 23 for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 2 has a solution is 31 and the least y for which it has a solution there is y=7, which is larger than 1, so it is a new record y value. So 31 is a term of A336788, and 7 is the corresponding term here.
