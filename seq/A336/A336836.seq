%N A336836 Number of iterations of x -> A003961(x) needed before A003961(x) < 2x, when starting from x=n, or -1 if such a number is never reached.
%C A336836 Starting from n, the number of prime shifts needed before a term of A246281 is reached.
%C A336836 It holds that a(n) >= A336835(n) for all n, because sigma(n) <= A003961(n) for all n (see A286385 for a proof).
%C A336836 Note that in contrast to abundancy used in A336835, the condition [A003961(x) > 2x] (= A252742) is not monotonic when iterating with A003961. For example, we have A003961(9) = 25 > 2*9, A003961(25) = 49 < 2*25, and then again A003961(49) = 121 > 2*49.
%C A336836 Question: Is the escape clause necessary in the definition?
