%N A336268 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers such that for any term, say k, there are k occurrences of k in the sequence, and the distance between any two consecutive occurrences of k equals k.
%C A336268 This sequence is a variant of A336215.
%C A336268 Will every integer appear in this sequence?

%e A336268 For n = 1:
%e A336268 - we can choose a(1) = 1.

%e A336268 - we can choose a(2) = 2,
%e A336268 - consequently: a(4) = 2.

%e A336268 For n = 5:
%e A336268 - a(5) cannot be equal to 4 as a(9) = 3,
