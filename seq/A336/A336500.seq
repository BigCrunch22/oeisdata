%N A336500 Number of divisors d|n with distinct prime multiplicities such that the quotient n/d also has distinct prime multiplicities.
%C A336500 A number's prime signature (row n of A124010) is the sequence of positive exponents in its prime factorization, so a number has distinct prime multiplicities iff all the exponents in its prime signature are distinct.
%e A336500 The a(1) = 1 through a(16) = 5 divisors:
