%N A336075 Decimal expansion of the ratio of segment areas for arclength Pi/5 on the unit circle; see Comments.
%C A336075 Suppose that s in (0,Pi) is the length of an arc of the unit circle. The associated chord separates the interior into two segments. Let A1 be the area of the larger and A2 the area of the smaller. The term "ratio of segment areas" means A1/A2. See A336073 for a guide to related sequences.
%F A336075 ratio = (2*Pi - s + sin(s))/(s - sin(s)), where s = Pi/5.
