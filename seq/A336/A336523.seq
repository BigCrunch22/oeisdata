%N A336523 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms starting with a(1) = 0 and a(2) = 1 such that the product of the last two digits of the sequence rebuilds, digit after digit, the sequence itself.

%e A336523 After a(1) = 0 and a(2) = 1, the smallest unused term a(3) allowing the rebuilding of the sequence by multiplying its last two digits is 11 (1*1 = 1); now the succession of such products is 0, 1;
%e A336523 after a(3) = 11, the smallest unused term a(4) allowing the rebuilding of the sequence by multiplying its last two digits is 111 (as the product of the last two digits of 111 is 1*1 = 1); now the succession of the products is 0, 1, 1);
%e A336523 after a(4) = 111, the smallest unused term a(5) allowing the rebuilding of the sequence by multiplying its last two digits is 211 (as the product of the last two digits of 211 is 1*1 = 1); now the succession of the products is 0, 1, 1, 1);
