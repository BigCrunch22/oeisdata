%F A336234 The sequence is the values of d where 3*d^2+4*d+4, the sum of the four numbers for a square of size d, is prime. For even d this sum will always be even, thus all terms are odd.
%e A336234 The board is numbered as follows:

%e A336234 a(1) = 1 as the four numbers {1,2,5,3} form the corners of a square of size 1, and the sum of these number is 11, a prime number.
%e A336234 a(2) = 3 as the four numbers {1,7,25,10} form the corners of a square of size 3, and the sum of these number is 43, a prime number.
%e A336234 a(3) = 7 as the four numbers {1,29,113,36} form the corners of a square of size 7, and the sum of these number is 179, a prime number.
