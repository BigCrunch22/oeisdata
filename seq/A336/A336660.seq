%N A336660 a(n) is the maximal number of 1 X 1 squares in an arrangement of n squares, from 1 X 1 to n X n.
%C A336660 Terms were calculated by hand by the author. Terms should be verified.
%C A336660 On the infinite square grid we can draw every square anywhere, on any of the four quadrants or on several of them.
%C A336660 Note that distinct arrangements could give the same result for some values of n.
%C A336660 a(7) >= 24. - _Hugo Pfoertner_, based on data from Hermann Jurksch, Aug 02 2020
%C A336660 From _Hugo Pfoertner_, Aug 28 2020: (Start)
%C A336660 Hermann Jurksch (private communication) has provided a proof that a(n) <= floor((n^2 + n + 1)*(3/5)).
%C A336660 I myself conjecture that a(n) <= floor((n^2 - n)*(3/5)) for n >= 4.
%C A336660 Lower bounds based on numerical results for the terms a(12)-a(15) are 76, 88, 105, 118. (End)

%e A336660 From _Omar E. Pol_, Jul 30 2020: (Start)
%e A336660 For n = 1 we draw a 1 X 1 square, so a(1) = 1.
%e A336660 For n = 2 we draw a 2 X 2 square and then a 1 X 1 square, both with a vertex at the point (0,0) as shown below:
%e A336660     _ _
%e A336660    |_  |
%e A336660    |_|_|
%e A336660 .
%e A336660 We can see only one 1 X 1 square in the arrangement, so a(2) = 1.
%e A336660 For n = 3 first we draw a 3 X 3 square with a vertex at the point (0,0) and then we draw a 2 X 2 square centered at the point (3,3) as shown below:
%e A336660 .       _ _
%e A336660     _ _|_  |
%e A336660    |   |_|_|
%e A336660    |     |
%e A336660    |_ _ _|
%e A336660 .
%e A336660 Note that on the cell (3,3) we have formed a 1 X 1 square.
%e A336660 Finally we draw a 1 X 1 square on the cell (4,4) as shown below:
%e A336660 .       _ _
%e A336660     _ _|_|_| <-- cell (4,4)
%e A336660    |   |_|_|
%e A336660    |     |
%e A336660    |_ _ _|.
%e A336660 Note that on the cells (3,4) and (4,3) we have formed two new 1 X 1 squares, hence the total number of 1 X 1 squares in the arrangement is equal to 4, so a(3) = 4. (End)
