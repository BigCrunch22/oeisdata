%N A336264 a(0) = 0, and then the sequence alternates runs of distinct numbers with the same sign, the n-th run having abs(a(n)) terms; all positive numbers appear, in increasing order; all negative numbers appear, in decreasing order; a(1) = 1.
%C A336264 This sequence has similarities with Golomb's sequence (A001462) and A113138.
%C A336264 Every integer appears once in this sequence.

%e A336264 a(0) = 0 and a(1) = 1 by definition.
%e A336264 So the first run of positive terms has abs(a(1)) = 1 term.
%e A336264 a(2) starts the first run of negative terms: a(2) = -1; this run has abs(a(2)) = 1 term.
%e A336264 a(3) starts the second run of positive terms: a(3) = 2; this run has abs(a(3)) = 2 terms, so a(4) = 3.
%e A336264 a(5) starts the second run of negative terms and has abs(a(4)) = 3 terms: a(5) = -2, a(6) = -3, a(7) = -4.
