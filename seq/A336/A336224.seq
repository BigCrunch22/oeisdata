%N A336224 Numbers k such that the largest square dividing k is a unitary divisor of k and its square root has an even number of prime divisors (counted with multiplicity).
%C A336224 Terms k of A335275 such that A000188(k) is a term of A028260.
%C A336224 Numbers whose powerful part (A057521) is the square of a term of A028260.
%C A336224 The squarefree numbers (A005117) are terms of this sequence since if k is squarefree, then the largest square dividing k is 1 which is a unitary divisor, sqrt(1) has 0 prime divisors, and 0 is even.
%C A336224 The asymptotic density of this sequence is (5 * Product_{p prime} (1 - 1/(p^2*(p+1))) + 2 * Product_{p prime} (1 + 1/(p^2*(p+1))))/10 = (5 * 0.881513... + 2 * 1.125606...)/10 = 0.665878294481337275662425136416469977597382409701642... (Cohen, 1964; the first product is A065465).
