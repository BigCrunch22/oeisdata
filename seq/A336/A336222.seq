%N A336222 Numbers k such that the square root of the largest square dividing k has an even number of prime divisors (counted with multiplicity).
%C A336222 Numbers k such that A000188(k) is a term of A028260.
%C A336222 The squarefree numbers (A005117) are terms of this sequence since if k is squarefree, then A000188(k) = 1, 1 has 0 prime divisors, and 0 is even.
%C A336222 A number k is a term if and only if its powerful part, A057521(k), is a term.
%C A336222 The asymptotic density of this sequence is 7/10 (Cohen, 1964).
%C A336222 The corresponding sequence of numbers k such that the square root of the largest square dividing k has an even number of distinct prime divisors, i.e., numbers k such that A000188(k) is a term of A030231, is A333634.

%e A336222 2 is a term since the largest square dividing 2 is 1, sqrt(1) = 1, 1 has 0 prime divisors, and 0 is even.
%e A336222 16 is a term since the largest square dividing 16 is 16, sqrt(16) = 4, 4 = 2 * 2 has 2 prime divisors, and 2 is even.
