%N A336716 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers such that the sum of the last two digits of the sequence starts the new term.
%C A336716 No term ending with two or more zeros is part of the sequence as the next term would start with zero.

%e A336716 5 + 8 = 13; now the last two digits of the sequence are 1 and 3; their sum is 4; the last two digits of the sequence are now 3 and 4; their sum is 7; the last two digits are now 4 and 7 with sum 11; those two digits sum up to 2 but as 2 is already in the sequence we extend it with 20 as 20 is the smallest integer starting with the sum 2 that is not yet in the sequence.
