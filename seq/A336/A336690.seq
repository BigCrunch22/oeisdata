%N A336690 The rich sandwiches sequence (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A336690 Imagine we would have a pair of adjacent integers in the sequence like [1951, 2020]. The sandwich would then be made of the rightmost digit of a(n), the leftmost digit of a(n+1) and, in between, the sum of those two digits. The pair [1951, 2020] would then produce the (rich) sandwich 132. (Why rich? Because a poor sandwich would insert the absolute difference of the digits instead of their sum - that is 112 in this example). Please note that the pair [2020, 1951] would produce the rich and genuine sandwich 011 (we keep the leading zero: these are sandwiches after all, not integers).
%C A336690 Now we want the sequence to be the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms such that the successive sandwiches emerging from the sequence rebuild it, digit after digit.
%e A336690 The first successive sandwiches are: 9101, 011, 121, 121, 231, 132,...
%e A336690 The first one (9101) is visible between a(1) = 9 and a(2) = 10; we get the sandwich by inserting the sum 10 between 9 and 1.
%e A336690 The second sandwich (011) is visible between a(2) = 10 and a(3) = 101; we get this sandwich by inserting the sum 1 between 0 and 1.
%e A336690 The third sandwich (121) is visible between a(3) = 101 and a(4) = 1; we get this sandwich by inserting the sum 2 between 1 and 1; etc.
%e A336690 The successive sandwiches rebuild, digit by digit, the starting sequence.
%Y A336690 Cf. A335600 (the poor sandwiches sequence).
