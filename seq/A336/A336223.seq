%N A336223 Numbers k such that the largest square dividing k is a unitary divisor of k and its square root has an even number of distinct prime divisors.
%C A336223 First differs from A333634 at n = 47.
%C A336223 Terms k of A335275 such that A000188(k) is a term of A030231.
%C A336223 Numbers whose powerful part (A057521) is a square term of A030231.
%C A336223 The squarefree numbers (A005117) are terms of this sequence since if k is squarefree, then the largest square dividing k is 1 which is a unitary divisor, sqrt(1) = 1 has 0 prime divisors, and 0 is even.
%C A336223 The asymptotic density of this sequence is (Product_{p prime} (1 - 1/(p^2*(p+1))) + Product_{p prime} (1 - (2*p+1)/(p^2*(p+1))))/2 = (0.881513... + 0.394391...)/2 = 0.637952807730728551636349961980617856650450613867264... (Cohen, 1964; the first product is A065465).
