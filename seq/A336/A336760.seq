%N A336760 a(0) = 0; for n > 0, a(n) = a(n-1) - tau(n) if nonnegative and not already in the sequence, otherwise a(n) = a(n-1) + tau(n), where tau(n) is the number of divisors of n.
%C A336760 This sequences uses the same rules as Recamán's sequence A005132 except that, instead of adding or subtracting n each term, the number of divisors of n is used. See A000005.
%C A336760 For the first 10 million terms the smallest value not appearing is 28. The data indicate that a(n)/n approaches 1 as n goes to infinity. As tau(n) <= 2*sqrt(n) (see A046522), it implies that 28 and other small unvisited values will never be visited.
%C A336760 In the same range the maximum value is a(9998226) = 10987569, and 2202001 terms repeat a previously visited value, the first time this occurs is a(21) = a(16) = 16. The longest run of consecutive increasing terms is 30, starting at a(1115610) = 1217112, while the longest run of consecutive decreasing terms is 534, starting at a(9960335) = 10946233.

%e A336760 a(2) = 3. As 2 has two divisors, a(2) = a(1) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3.
%e A336760 a(4) = 2. As 4 has three divisors, and as 2 has not been previously visited and is nonnegative, a(4) = a(3) - 3 = 5 - 3 = 2.
