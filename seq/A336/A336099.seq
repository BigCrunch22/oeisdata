%N A336099 Number of solutions of the equation k = n*sopf(k) in positive integers where sopf(k) is the sum of distinct prime factors of k.
%C A336099 Offset is 2 because a(1) cannot be defined since there are infinitely many solutions for n = 1, the primes.
%C A336099 If n = p^s then p^(s+1) is solution of k = n*sopf(k). Hence a(p^s) > 0. On the other hand there are infinitely many 0's in the sequence. For example a(5^s*11^t) = 0 for all positive integers s, t.
%C A336099 Records appear to occur only at prime n. These are seen in A336296, although note that A336296 is not monotonic, so it includes other terms. - _Bill McEachen_, Dec 02 2023

%e A336099 a(3) = 2 because there are exactly 2 solutions of the equation k = 3*sopf(k) in positive integers (9 and 30).
%Y A336099 Cf. A008472, A336098, A336296.
