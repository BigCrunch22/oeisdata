%N A336740 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms starting with a(1) = 110 such that the successive sums of the last two digits of the sequence reproduce, digit by digit, the sequence itself.

%e A336740 After a(1) = 110 (the sum of the last two digits is 1) the smallest unused term allowing us to reconstruct the sequence by adding its last two digits is a(2) = 19 (1+9 = 10); the succession of the two sums so far is 1, 10;
%e A336740 a(3) = 10, the smallest unused term allowing us to rebuild the sequence by adding its last two digits (1+0 = 1); the succession of the three sums so far is 1, 10, 1;
%e A336740 a(4) = 9, the smallest unused term allowing us to rebuild the sequence by adding its last two digits (0+9 = 9); the succession of the four sums so far is 1, 10, 1, 9;
%e A336740 a(5) = 1, the smallest unused term allowing us to rebuild the sequence by adding its last two digits (9+1 = 10); the succession of the five sums so far is 1, 10, 1, 9, 10 which is precisely the succession of the sequence's digits itself. Etc.
