%N A336363 Number of iterations of map k -> k*sigma(p^e)/p^e needed to reach a power of 2, where p is the largest prime factor of k and e is its exponent, when starting from k = n. a(n) = -1 if number of the form 2^k is never reached.
%C A336363 Informally: starting from k=n, keep on replacing p^e, the maximal power of the largest prime factor in k, with (1 + p + p^2 + ... + p^e), until a power of 2 is reached. Sequence counts the steps needed.

%F A336363 If A209229(n) = 1 [when n is a power of 2], a(n) = 0, otherwise a(n) = 1 + a(sigma(A053585(n))*(n/A053585(n))).
%F A336363 a(n) = a(2n) = a(A000265(n)).
%e A336363 For n = 15 = 3*5, we obtain the following path, when starting from k = n, and when we always replace the maximal power of the largest prime factor, p^e of k with sigma(p^e) = (1 + p + p^2 + ... + p^e) in the prime factorization k: 3^1 * 5^1 -> 3*(5+1) = 18 = 2^1 * 3^2 -> 2 * (1+3+9) = 26 = 2 * 13 -> 2 * (13+1) = 28 = 2^2 * 7 -> 4*(7+1) = 2^5, thus it took four iterations to reach a power of two, and a(15) = 4.
