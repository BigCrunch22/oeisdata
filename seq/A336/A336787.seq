%N A336787 Incrementally largest values of minimal x satisfying the equation x^2 - D*y^2 = 2, where D is a prime number.
%C A336787 Analogous to A033315 for x^2 - D*y^2 = 1, and D required to be prime. The x values incrementally largest for x^2 - D*y^2 = 2. D values appear in sequence A336786.

%e A336787 For D=31, the least x for which x^2 - Dy^2 = 2 has a solution is 39. The next prime, D, for which x^2 - Dy^2 = 2 has a solution is 47, but the smallest x in this case is 7, which is less than 39. The next prime, D, after 47 for which x^2 - Dy^2 = 2 has a solution is 71 and the least x for which it has a solution is x=59, which is larger than 39, a new record value, so 71 is a term of A336786 and 59 is the corresponding term of this sequence. 47 is not a term of A336786 because the least x for which x^2 - 47*y^2 = 2 has a solution is not a record value.
