%N A336586 Smallest nonnegative integer containing the n-th letter of the Hebrew alphabet (in Hebrew using feminine numbers), or -1 if no such integer exists.
%C A336586 This sequence assumes the use of the short scale for naming large numbers. It also assumes that 10^9 is called "ביליון" (billion); if 10^9 is instead called "מיליארד" (milliard) then a(4) = 10^9 rather than 10^15.
%C A336586 Final forms of the letters are considered the same as the normal forms. There are no numbers with ז (zayin), כ (kaf), or צ (tsadi) in their names. ג (gimel) appears only in vocabulary transliterated into Hebrew based on Landon Curt Noll's latin-based power of 1000 naming system and not in everyday vocabulary (hence why a(3) = 10^63).
