%N A336891 Sequence following Van Eck's sequence unless a prime which was previously encountered is found, in which case, a(n+1) = n - m, where m is the largest possible value such that a(m) is also prime.
%C A336891 Van Eck's sequence (A181391) is an integer sequence defined as follows; Let a(0) = 0. For, n >= 0, if there exists an m < n such that a(m) = a(n), take the largest such m and set a(n+1) = n - m, otherwise a(n+1) = 0. This sequence modifies the Van Eck sequence, adding an additional condition in that if a(n) is prime, set a(n+1) = n - m, where m is the largest possible value such that a(m) is also prime.
%e A336891 Start with a(1) = 0.
%e A336891 0 has not occurred before, so the rule says a(2) = 0.
%e A336891 Now 0 HAS occurred before, at a(1), 0 is not prime, so a(3) = 1, which is the number of places before a(2) where 0 occurs.
%e A336891 1 has not occurred before, so a(4) = 0.
%e A336891 0 occurred most recently at term a(2) and is not prime, so a(5) = 2.
%e A336891 2 has not occurred before, so a(6) = 0.
%e A336891 0 occurred most recently at term a(4) and is not prime, so a(7) = 2.
%e A336891 2 occurred most recently at term a(5) and 2 IS prime, so a(8) = 2 which is the number of places back where the previous prime occurred.
%e A336891 .. and so on!
