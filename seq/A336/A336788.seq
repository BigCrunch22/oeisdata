%N A336788 Values of prime numbers, D, for incrementally largest values of minimal y satisfying the equation x^2 - D*y^2 = 2.
%e A336788 For D = 2, the least y for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 2 has a solution is 1.
%e A336788 The next primes, D, for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 2 has a solution are 7 and 23, but the smallest y in each of these cases is also 1, which is equal to the previous record y. So neither 7 nor 23 is a term.
%e A336788 The next prime, D, after 23 for which x^2 - D*y^2 = 2 has a solution is 31 and the least y for which it has a solution there is y = 7, which is larger than 1, so it is a new record y value. So 31 is a term here, and 7 is the corresponding term of A336789.
%Y A336788 Cf. A033316 (analogous for x^2 - D*y^2 = 1), A336786 (similar sequence for x's), A336789.
