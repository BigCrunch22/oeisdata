%N A336757 Number of primitive integer-sided triangles whose sides a < b < c are in arithmetic progression with a perimeter = n.
%C A336757 Equivalently: number of primitive integer-sided triangles such that b = (a+c)/2 with a < c and perimeter = n.
%C A336757 As the perimeter of these triangles = 3*b where b is the middle side, a(n) >= 1 iff n = 3*b, with b >= 3.
%C A336757 When b is prime, all the triangles of perimeter n = 3*b are primitive, hence in this case: a(n) = A024164(n).
%C A336757 For the corresponding triples (primitive or not), miscellaneous properties and references, see A336750.
%F A336757 For n = 3*b, b >= 3, a(n) = A023022(b) = A000010(b)/2, otherwise a(n) = 0.
%e A336757 a(9) = 1 for the smallest such triangle (2, 3, 4).
%e A336757 a(12) = 1 for the Pythagorean triple (3, 4, 5).
%e A336757 a(15) = 2 for the two triples (3, 5, 7) and (4, 5, 6).
%e A336757 a(18) = 1 for the triple (5, 6, 7); the other triple (4, 6, 8) corresponding to a perimeter = 18 is not a primitive triple.
