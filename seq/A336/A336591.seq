%N A336591 Numbers whose exponents in their prime factorization are either 1, 3, or both.
%C A336591 The asymptotic density of this sequence is zeta(6)/(zeta(2) * zeta(3)) * Product_{p prime} (1 + 2/p^3 - 1/p^4 + 1/p^5) = 0.68428692418686231814196872579121808347231273672316377728461822629005... (Cohen, 1962).
%C A336591 First differs from A036537 at n = 89. A036537(89) = 128 = 2^7 is not a term of this sequence.

%e A336591 1 is a term since it has no exponents, and thus it has no exponent that is not 1 or 3.
%e A336591 2 is a term since 2 = 2^1 has only the exponent 1 in its prime factorization.
%e A336591 24 is a term since 24 = 2^3 * 3^1 has the exponents 1 and 3 in its prime factorization.
