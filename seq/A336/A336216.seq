%N A336216 Irregular triangle of cycles of purely periodic unitary sigma aliquot sequences with their smallest member as starting number, read by rows.
%C A336216 For the definition of unitary divisors see A034448. This sequence is a permutation of A327157; the starting numbers of successive cycles are in increasing order; the numbers in a cycle are kept in the order of the iteration with the smallest number in the cycle as the starting number. In order to be consistent with A327157 the terminal 1-cycle consisting of 1 is not included in the sequence.
%C A336216 Sequence A336218 gives the cycle lengths, therefore the start of the k-th cycle in this sequence is at index 1 + Sum_{i=1..k-1} A336218(i). Sequence A336219 is the first column of the triangle.
%C A336216 From the formula of _Vladeta Jovovic_ in A034448, it follows that all unitary aliquot sequences, and hence cycles, contain only odd numbers or only even numbers (except for the possible terminal 1). The table of _Antti Karttunen_ in the link of A327157 includes just 2 odd cycles, the 2-cycles: 8619765, 9627915 and 17257695, 17578785.
%e A336216 The first cycle of size 14 starting at position 16 is: 2418, 2958, 3522, 3534, 4146, 4158, 3906, 3774, 4434, 4446, 3954, 3966, 3978, 3582. Its 7th element is the first number in this sequence smaller than its predecessor.
