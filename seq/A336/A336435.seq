%N A336435 a(n) is the least k such that A069230(k) = n.
%e A336435 a(10) = 12 as A069230(12) = 10 as there are 10 primes between (exclusive) 12 and 12 + tau(12)^2 = 12 + 6^2 = 12 + 36 = 48 namely the 10 primes 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47 and k = 12 is the least k such that there are ten primes between (exclusive) k and k + tau(k)^2 where tau is the number of divisors (Cf. A000005).
