%N A336946 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) is the next square spiral number not already used such that a(n) shares a factor with a(n-1) and also with the adjacent number on the inner spiral arm if such a number exists.
%C A336946 This is a variation of the EKG sequence A064413 where the numbers are written on the square spiral such that each new number must share a common factor with not only the previous number but also with the adjacent inner spiral number, in one of the four axial directions, if such a number exists. This additional restriction causes the numbers to violate some of the patterns the numbers form in the standard EKG sequence, e.g., an odd prime p does not need to be preceded by 2p or followed by 3p, and the primes do not appear in increasing order.
%C A336946 For the first 100000 terms the smallest unseen number is 433.

%e A336946 .
%e A336946 a(1)-a(8) = 1,2,4,6,3,9,12,8. The adjacent inner spiral number is 1 which all numbers share a factor with so the numbers are the same as A064413(n).
%e A336946 a(9) = 10. This is the first number that must have a common factor with two numbers, the previous number a(8) = 8 and the adjacent spiral number a(2) = 2. The lowest unused number satisfying this requirement is 10.
%e A336946 a(10) = 5. As this number is on the corner of a square spiral arm it only needs to share a divisor with a(9) = 10. The lowest unseen number satisfying this is 5.
%e A336946 a(11) = 20.  This number must have a common factor with the previous number a(10) = 5 and the adjacent spiral number a(2) = 2. The lowest unused number satisfying this requirement is 20. This is also the first number to differ from  A064413 which only needs to find the lowest unused number sharing a factor with 5, which is 15.
