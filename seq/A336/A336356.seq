%N A336356 Characteristic function of A336359, numbers k for which A001222(A000203(k)) < A001222(k).
%C A336356 If a(x) = a(y) = 1 and gcd(x,y) = 1, then a(x*y) = 1 also. If a(x) = a(y) = 0 and gcd(x,y) = 1, then a(x*y) = 0 also. This follows because both A001222 and A058063 are additive sequences, their difference A336386 is also.
