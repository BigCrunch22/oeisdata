%N A336834 a(n) = 1 if A005940(1+n) is deficient, 0 otherwise.
%C A336834 Any node of Doudna-tree (A005940) which is deficient, is marked here with 1, and has also its all leftward descendants (those that are obtained only by prime shifting, A003961) deficient.
%C A336834 Any odd node marked with 0 here (that is, nondeficient nodes in A005940) has all its ancestors up at least to the first even ancestor also nondeficient. None is the seen in the illustration below, because the first case is 945, which is the first odd abundant number (A005231), whose even parent is A064989(945) = 120, also an abundant number. (But please see also _Michael De Vlieger_'s illustration of the tree down to level 8 where it is included in the bottom row).
%C A336834 Specifically, any odd perfect number, if they exist, should have an abundant mother (which should be also a member of A336930), and also abundant grand-ancestors (on the prime-shift line), up to and including the first even ancestor, at least.
%C A336834 On the other hand, when going towards the right, any right child has larger abundancy index than its mother has, and on all rightward leaning edges, except on the rightmost (powers of 2), a nondeficient number is eventually reached. See A336915.
