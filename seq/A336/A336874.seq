%N A336874 The self-sandwiches sequence (see Comments lines for definition).
%C A336874 Imagine we would have a pair of adjacent integers in the sequence like [1951, 2020]. The sandwich would then be made of the rightmost digit of a(n), the leftmost digit of a(n+1) and, in between, the single digit d of the sequence itself not been yet duplicated inside a sandwich. The pair [1951, 2020] would then produce the sandwich 1d2. Please note that the pair [2020, 1951] would produce the genuine sandwich 0d1 (we keep the leading zero: these are sandwiches after all, not integers).
%C A336874 Now we want the sequence to be the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms such that the successive sandwiches emerging from the sequence rebuild it, digit after digit.
%C A336874 The authors are unable to compute more terms than the ones proposed here and ask the readers' indulgence.
%e A336874 The first successive sandwiches are: 112, 212, 122, 222, 212,...
%e A336874 The 1st one (112) is visible between a(1) = 11 and a(2) = 2; we get the sandwich by inserting the 1st digit of the sequence itself, 1.
%e A336874 The 2nd sandwich (212) is visible between a(2) = 2 and a(3) = 21; we get this sandwich by inserting inserting the 2nd digit of the sequence itself, 1.
%e A336874 The 3rd sandwich (122) is visible between a(3) = 21 and a(4) = 212; we get this sandwich by inserting the 3rd digit of the sequence itself, 2.
%e A336874 The 4th sandwich (222) is visible between a(4) = 212 and a(5) = 22; we get this sandwich by inserting the 4th digit of the sequence itself, 2. Etc..
%e A336874 The successive sandwiches rebuild, digit by digit, the starting sequence.
%Y A336874 Cf. A335600 (first sequence of this kind, linked to many others).
