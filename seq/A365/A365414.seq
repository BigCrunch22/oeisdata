%N A365414 a(n) = sigma(6*n+4). Sum of the divisors of 6*n+4, n >= 0.
%C A365414 Consider a spiral similar to the spiral described in A239660 but instead of having four quadrants on the square grid the new spiral has six wedges on the triangular grid. A "diamond" formed by two adjacent triangles has area 1. a(n) is the number of diamonds (or the area) added in the fourth wedge after n turns. The interesting fact is that for n >> 1 the geometric pattern in the fourth wedge of the spiral is similar to the geometric pattern of the second wedge but it is different from the other wedges.
%F A365414 a(n) = A000203(6*n+4).
