%N A365412 a(n) = sigma(6*n+2). Sum of the divisors of 6*n+2, n >= 0.
%C A365412 Consider a spiral similar to the spiral described in A239660 but instead of having four quadrants on the square grid the new spiral has six wedges on the triangular grid. A "diamond" formed by two adjacent triangles has area 1. a(n) is the number of diamonds (or the area) added in the second wedge after n turns. The interesting fact is that for n >> 1 the geometric pattern in the second wedge of the spiral is similar to the geometric pattern of the fourth wedge but it is different from the other wedges.
%F A365412 a(n) = A000203(6*n+2).
%F A365412 a(n) = A000203(A016933(n)).
