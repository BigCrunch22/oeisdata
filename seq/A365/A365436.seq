%N A365436 a(2^k) = 2^k for all k >= 0. let 2^r be the smallest power of 2 which exceeds n, then a(n) = the least novel m*a(k), where k = 2^r-n, and m is not a prior term.
%C A365436 Based on a recursion similar to that which produces the Doudna sequence, A005940, (using the least power of 2 exceeding n rather than the greatest power of 2 not exceeding n). All 2^(n-1) terms between between fixed points 2^n and 2^(n+1) are multiples m*a(k) of m, the least unused term, and m is a(2^(k+1)-1).
%C A365436 Conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A365436 From _David A. Corneth_, Nov 11 2023: (Start)
%C A365436 This is a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A365436 To prove this we'll show that each integer occurs at most once and at least once hence exactly once.
%C A365436 By definition (...a(n) = the least novel...) each positive integer occurs at most once.
%C A365436 Now suppose t is the smallest term not in the sequence. Then there exists u such that a(1)..a(u) contain the positive integers from 1 through t-1. Then a(i) = t for some 1 <= i <= 2^e - 1 where 2^e - 1 >= u. If a(i) != t for 1 <= i <= 2^e-2 then a(2^e - 1) = t as then k = 1, a(k) = 1 and m is not a prior term (t did not occur earlier).
%C A365436 Hence t occurs at least once. As it also occurs at most once every positive integer occurs exactly once and this sequence is a permutation of the positive integers. (End)
