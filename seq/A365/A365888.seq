%N A365888 Starts of run of 3 consecutive integers that are terms of A365886.
%C A365888 Numbers k such that k, k+1 and k+2 are all terms of A365886.
%C A365888 Numbers of the form 4*k+2 are not terms of A365886. Therefore there are no runs of 4 or more consecutive integers. Since the middle integer in each triple is even it must be and divisible by 8, so all the terms of this sequence are of the form 8*k+7.
%C A365888 The numbers of terms not exceeding 10^k, for k = 7, 8, ..., are 2, 20, 198, 1979, 19796, ... . Apparently, the asymptotic density of this sequence exists and equals 1.979...*10^(-7).
