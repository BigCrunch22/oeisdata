%N A365938 Form the "Gilbreath Transform" array for the Euler phi function (A000010); sequence gives the third coulmn, divided by 2.
%e A365938 The first 4 rows of the Gilbreath Transform array for phi(n) are:
%e A365938 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 6, 4, 6, 4,10, 4,12, 6, 8, 8,16, 6,18, 8,12,10,22, 8,20

%e A365938 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 4, 0, 2, 2, 4, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 6, 2,10, 2, 2, 4, 2

%e A365938 The third column is 2, 0, 2, 2, ..., which when halved gives the current sequence 1, 0, 1, 1, ...
%e A365938 I conjecture that the first column is (1,0) repeated, and the second column is all 1's.
%Y A365938 Cf. A000010, A036262, A361897.
