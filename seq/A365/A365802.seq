%N A365802 Numbers k such that A163511(k) is a fifth power.
%C A365802 Equivalently, numbers k for which A332214(k), and also A332817(k) are fifth powers.
%C A365802 The sequence is defined inductively as:
%C A365802  (a) it contains 0 and 16, and
%C A365802  (b) for any nonzero term a(n), (2*a(n)) + 1 and 32*a(n) are also included as terms.
%C A365802 When iterating n -> 2n+1 mod 31, starting from 16 we obtain five distinct remainders 16, 2, 5, 11, 23, before the cycle starts again from 16. (see A153893), while x^5 mod 31 may obtain only these values: 0, 1, 5, 6, 25, 26, 30. The only common element of these sets is 5. We have x^5 == 5 (mod 31) whenever x == 7, 14, 19, 25, 28 mod 31, with all other x leaving a remainder that is not in the set [16, 2, 5, 11, 23].
%C A365802 On the other hand, when iterating n -> 2n+1 mod 33, starting from 16 we obtain ten distinct remainders 16, 0, 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 30, 28, 24, before the cycle starts again from 16, while x^5 mod 33 obtain only these values: 0, 1, 10, 11, 12, 21, 22, 23, 32. We have x^5 == 0 (mod 33) iff x == 0 (mod 33) and x^5 == 1 (mod 33) whenever x == 1, 4, 16, 25, 31 mod 33. In the n->2n+1 cycles of 5 and 10 elements starting from 16, the 5's (of every second cycle) in the former and and 1's in the latter are aligned with each other.
%C A365802 In any case, this sequence do not contain any fifth powers after the initial zero. See A365805. - _Antti Karttunen_, Nov 23 2023
