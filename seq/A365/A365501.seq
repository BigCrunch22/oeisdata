%N A365501 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not yet appeared whose binary string value contains all the binary distinct prime factors of a(n-1). Overlapping factor strings is allowed.
%C A365501 This is the base-2 equivalent of A365500. As the term a(3) = 4 is not immediately followed by 8, 8 and other higher powers of 2 will never appear as they could only be the following term of a smaller power of 2.
%C A365501 In the first 10000 terms the fixed points are 239, 373, 488, 854, 942, 3573, 5580, 5968.

%e A365501 a(6) = 11 = 1011_2 as a(5) = 10 which contains 2 = 10_2 and 5 = 101_2 as distinct prime factors, and the string "1011" contains both "10" and "101" as substrings.
