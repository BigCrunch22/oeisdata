%N A365214 Least k such that the binary representation of 3^k has exactly n 1's, or -1 if no such k exists.
%C A365214 Least k such that A011754(k) = n, or -1 if no such k exists.
%C A365214 The first 22 terms are from Dimitrov and Howe (2021). After a(22), the sequence continues (with the -1's conjectural but very likely correct) -1, 26, 28, 31, 36, 40, 34, 27, -1, 35, 49, 33, 53, 38, -1, 42, 41, 57, 48, 52, -1, -1, 46, 51, 67, 59, 62, -1, ... .
