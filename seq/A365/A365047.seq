%N A365047 a(n) is the number of three-term geometric progressions, with rational ratio > 0, formed by the terms a(n-1), a(n-1-k) and a(n-1-2*k), where k >= 1 and n - 1 - 2*k >= 0.
%C A365047 The sequence is dominated by the count of three-term progressions consisting of three 0's. The 0 terms alternate between long runs on the even and odd n values, so the larger nonzero terms alternate between counting the progressions on these two subsequences, leading to two interrupted lines on the graph of the terms, along with the much lower counts of other three-term subsequences. See the attached image.
