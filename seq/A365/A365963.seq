%N A365963 Let I(n) be the moment of inertia of the polyomino with binary code A246521(n+1) about an axis through its center of mass perpendicular to the plane of the polyomino, the polyomino having a unit point mass in the center of each of its cells. a(n) is I(n) times the number of cells of the polyomino.
%C A365963 If the cells have a uniform density of 1 instead of point masses in the centers, the moment of inertia is I(n) + k/6 = a(n)/k + k/6, where k is the number of cells.
%F A365963 If the centers of the cells of the polyomino have coordinates (x_i,y_i), 1 <= i <= k, its moment of inertia is Sum_{i=1..k} x_i^2+y_i^2 - (Sum_{i=1..k} x_i)^2/k - (Sum_{i=1..k} y_i)^2/k.

%e A365963 The five tetrominoes have moments of inertia 7/2, 2, 11/4, 3, 5 (in the order they appear in A246521). Multiplying these numbers by 4, we obtain the 4th row.
%e A365963 The last term of the k-th row of the irregular triangle corresponds to the straight k-omino, whose moment of inertia is k*(k^2-1)/12, so the last term of the k-th row is k^2*(k^2-1)/12 = A002415(k). (This ought to be the largest term of the k-th row.)
