%N A365871 Starts of runs of 3 consecutive integers whose exponent of least prime factor in their prime factorization is even.
%C A365871 Numbers k such that k, k+1 and k+2 are all terms of A365869.
%C A365871 Numbers of the form 4*k+2 are not terms of A365869. Therefore, there are no runs of 4 or more consecutive integers, and all the terms of this sequence are of the form 4*k+3.
%C A365871 The numbers of terms not exceeding 10^k, for k = 3, 4, ..., are 1, 18, 195, 1952, 19542, 195514, 1955859, 19560453, 195611458, ... . Apparently, the asymptotic density of this sequence exists and equals 0.001956... .
