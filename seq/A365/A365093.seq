%N A365093 Smallest k such that A365092(k) = n.
%C A365093 a(n) is well-defined for all n >= 2.
%C A365093 Sequence is increasing: write a(n) as the sums and products of 1s by the process described in A365092. Removing any 1 in the expression yields a smaller number.
%C A365093 For m,n >= 2, it is easy to see that if gcd(a(m),a(n)) = 1, then a(m+n) <= a(m)*a(n). This is conjectured to be true for all m,n. In particular, it is conjectured that a(n+2) <= 2*a(n). If a(m+n) <= a(m)*a(n) is true, then by Fekete's subadditive lemma, we have lim_{n->oo} a(n)^(1/n) = inf_{n>=1} a(n)^(1/n) <= a(29)^(1/29) = 2879^(1/29) = 1.3160857758...
%C A365093 Are all terms other than 4, 20, 92 and 188 squarefree?
%C A365093 What are the primes that divide infinitely many terms? In particular, for p = 2 or 47, are there infinitely many terms divisible by p? Is there any term divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11 or 43 other than themselves, 235 and 517?

%e A365093 a(9) = 20 since 20 = (1+1)^(1+1)*((1+1)^(1+1)+1) (see A365092) uses nine 1s, and all smaller numbers use fewer than nine 1s.
