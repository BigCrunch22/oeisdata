%N A365500 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number that has not yet appeared whose string value contains all the distinct prime factors of a(n-1). Overlapping factor strings is allowed.
%C A365500 Any number that contains only nonprime digits, does not contain any substring that is prime, and is not itself a prime can never appear, e.g., 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 14.
%F A365500 a(3) = 12 as a(2) = 2 and "12" is the smallest unused number to contain "2".
%F A365500 a(4) = 23 as a(3) = 12 = 2*2*3 and "23" is the smallest unused number to contain both "2" and "3".
%F A365500 a(7) = 311 as a(6) = 341 = 11*31 and "311" is the smallest unused number to contain both "11" and "31". This is the first term to contain overlapping factor strings.
