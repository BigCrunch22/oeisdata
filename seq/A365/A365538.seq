%C A365538 Related to a model of X-chromosome inheritance:
%C A365538 The two X chromosomes of a female are inherited one from each parent, while the X chromosome of a male is always inherited from his mother. Thus, the probability distribution of inheritance from the parents (mother, father) is (0.5, 0.5) for a female and (1, 0) for a male. For the inheritance of any X-chromosome of a female from the 2^i ancestors of the i-th generation before (right to left on an ahnentafel), the distribution is given by the first 2^i terms of the sequence, divided by 2^i. For example, the X-chromosome of a man, which was inherited from his mother, was inherited from his mother's 16 great-great-grandparents with probabilities 1/16, 1/16, 1/8, 0, 1/8, 1/8, 0, 0, 1/8, 1/8, 1/4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.
