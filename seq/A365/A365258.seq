%N A365258 The four digits of a(n), their three successive absolute first differences and their two successive absolute second differences are all distinct.
%C A365258 The digit 0 is never present in a(n) and never appears as a first or a second difference (as this would duplicate in both cases one of the 8 remaining digits involved).
%C A365258 The sequence ends with a(18) = 9318.
%e A365258 2983 is a term since its three successive absolute first differences 7 (= 2 - 9), 1 (= 9 - 8), 5 (= 8 - 3) and the successive absolute second differences 6 (= 7 - 1) and 4 (= 1 - 5), are nine distinct digits.
