%N A365270 Practical numbers that have middle divisors.
%C A365270 Very similar to A174973 from which differs at a(195) = 1014 here and 1020 there.
%C A365270 It appears that these are also the practical numbers k whose symmetric representation of sigma(k) has an odd number of parts.
%e A365270 a(195) = 1014 is a practical number (A005153) and it has two middle divisors so 1014 is in the sequence.
%Y A365270 Intersection of A005153 and A071562.
%Y A365270 Cf. A067742, A174973 = A238443, A236104, A237270, A237271, A237591, A237593, A317412.
