%N A365159 a(n)=n for n<=3, and thereafter, a(n) is the number of locations 1..n-1 which cannot be reached starting from i=n-1, where jumps from location i to i +- a(i) are permitted (within 1..n-1). See example.

%e A365159 a(9)=3 because there are 3 locations that cannot be reached starting from i=n-1=8, where a(8)=4. We start by finding the locations that can be reached (each line shows the next unvisited location(s) we can reach from the term(s) in the previous iteration):
%e A365159 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4
%e A365159          2<----------4
%e A365159 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4
%e A365159    2<----2---->3
%e A365159 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4
%e A365159       3<-------3
%e A365159 We visited 5 locations (i = 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8) and can visit no more:
%e A365159 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4
%e A365159    2  3  2     3     4
%e A365159 This leaves a total of 3 locations that could not be reached (i = 1, 5, and 7) from i=8, so a(9)=3.
