%N A365000 a(n) = n for n <= 2; for n > 2, rad(a(m)) != rad(a(n)), m < n, implies a(n+1) is the least novel k such that rad(k) | a(n), rad(a(m)) = rad(a(n)), m < n, implies a(n+1) = q*a(n), where q is the least novel prime such that gcd(q, a(n)) = 1 and rad(a(m)) != rad(q*a(n)), m < n.
%C A365000 Let rad(n) = A007947(n).
%C A365000 In other words, starting with 1 and 2, thereafter, if a(n) is such that rad(a(m)) != rad(a(n)), m < n, then a(n+1) is the smallest k != a(m) such that rad(k) | a(n).
%C A365000 If there is a term a(m) such that rad(a(m)) = rad(a(n)), then a(n+1) is the smallest k != a(m) obtainable from a(n) by multiplying a(n) by a nondivisor prime q, and the result must be such that there is no prior term a(m) with rad(a(m)) = rad(a(n)).
%C A365000 Primes appear in order as a consequence of first condition.
%C A365000 If a(n) = p, then a(n+1) = p^2 for prime p.
%C A365000 The second condition implies a(m) != q*a(n), m < n.
%C A365000 Conjectures:
%C A365000 1. Sequence is a permutation of natural numbers.
%C A365000 2. Primorials outside of {1, 2, 30} enter late. a(18) = 6, a(19) = 30, a(20476) = 210, a(20477) = 2310. Thereafter many long-missing k such that 30 | k and 210 | k enter the sequence.

%e A365000 a(3) = 4 since rad(a(2)) = rad(2) = 2, and rad(1) = 1, and the smallest missing number k such that rad(k) | 2 is 4.
%e A365000 a(4) = 12 since rad(a(3)) = rad(4) = 2, rad(2) = 2, and thus since q = 3 is the smallest prime that does not divide a(3) = 4, a(4) = q * a(3) = 3 * 4 = 12.
%e A365000 a(5) = 3 since rad(a(4)) = rad(12) = 6, and no a(m), m < 4 has rad(a(m)) = 6. Thus we select the smallest number missing number k such that rad(k) | 12, so k = 3.
%e A365000 a(6) = 9 since a(5) is squarefree and thus rad(a(5)) = 3; no a(m), m < 5, has rad(a(m)) = 3. We select the smallest missing number k such that rad(k) | 3, and that is 9.
%e A365000 a(7) = 45 since a number a(m), m < 6, with rad(a(m)) = 3 has appeared. Therefore we find the smallest prime q that does not divide 9, but also is such that no a(m), m < n, rad(a(m)) | q*a(6) appears in the sequence. Since numbers a(m) with rad(a(m)) = 6 already appear, we are forced to q = 5, hence a(7) = 5 * a(6) = 5 * 9 = 45, etc.
