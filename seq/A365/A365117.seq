%N A365117 a(1) = 1. Thereafter a(n) is the least novel multiple m of the smallest prime which does not divide a(n-1) and such that m is coprime to a(n-1).
%C A365117 The Name is as for A351495, but with an extra constraint: namely that a(n) is prime to a(n-1).
%C A365117 {a(n)}; n > 1 is a permutation of A047228.

Certain residues (mod 210) seem to be devoid of squarefree numbers, perhaps since they are a product 9*m.
%F A365117 From _Michael De Vlieger_, Aug 22 2023: (Start)
%F A365117 a(2n) == +-2 (mod 6).
%F A365117 a(2n+1) == 3 (mod 6), n > 0. (End)
%e A365117 a(2) = 2 because 2 is the smallest prime which does not divide 1, and 2 is prime to 1.
%e A365117 3(3) = 3 because 3 is the smallest prime which does not divide 2, and 3 is prime to 2.
%e A365117 a(4) = 4 since it is the second multiple of 2, the smallest prime that does not divide 3, and 4 is prime to 3.
%e A365117 a(5) = 9 since it is the least novel multiple of 3, the smallest prime that does not divide 4, and is the least such number prime to 4.
