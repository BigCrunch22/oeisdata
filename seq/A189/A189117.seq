%N A189117 Conjectured number of pairs of consecutive perfect powers (A001597) differing by n.
%C A189117 Only a(1) is proved. Perfect powers examined up to 10^21. This is similar to A076427, but more restrictive.
%C A189117 Hence, through 10^21, there is only one value in the sequence: Semiprimes which are both one more than a perfect power and one less than another perfect power. This is to perfect powers A001597 approximately as A108278 is to squares. A more exact analogy would be to the set of integers such as 30^2 = 900 since 900-1 = 899 = 29 * 31, and 900+1 = 901 = 17 * 53. A189045 INTERSECTION A189047. a(1) = 26 because 26 = 2 * 13 is semiprime, 26-1 = 25 = 5^2, and 26+1 = 27 = 3^3. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Apr 16 2011
%C A189117 Pillai's conjecture is that a(n) is finite for all n. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Apr 30 2012
