%N A189764 Greatest integer x such that x' = 2n and x is not a semiprime, or 0 if there is no such x, where x' is the arithmetic derivative (A003415).
%C A189764 As mentioned in A102084, the anti-derivatives of even numbers are overwhelmingly semiprimes of the form n^2 - k^2. This sequence excludes those semiprimes. The upper bound of a(n) appears to be (n/2)^(4/3), which is attained when 2n = 4p^3 for primes p>3.
