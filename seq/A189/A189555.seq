%N A189555 Numbers n such that x' = n has two solutions, where x' is the arithmetic derivative (A003415) of x.
%C A189555 Ufnarovski and Ahlander conjecture that this sequence, and any such sequence that has numbers n such that x' = n has k solutions, is infinite. See A098700 and A189481 for the k=0 and 1 cases. It appears that the only even terms here are 10, 12, 14, 18, 20, 28, and 38. The prime terms are in A189556.
