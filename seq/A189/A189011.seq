%N A189011 Zero-one sequence based on triangular numbers:  a(A000217(k))=a(k); a(A014132(k))=1-a(k); a(1)=0.
%e A189011 Let u=A000217 and v=A014132, so that u(n)=n(n+1)/2 and v=complement(u) for n>=1.  Then a is a self-generating zero-one sequence with initial value a(1)=0 and a(u(k))=a(k); a(v(k))=1-a(k).
