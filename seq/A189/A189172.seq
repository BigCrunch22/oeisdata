%N A189172 Largest prime number tried when factoring n using trial division.
%C A189172 When factoring a number via trial division, one generally continues trying primes until it is certain that the remaining portion of n is prime.  Sometimes, it is already clear that the remaining portion is prime before that portion is found; in this case, the last prime tried is the second to last prime factor.
%H A189172 T. D. Noe, <a href="/A189172/b189172.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..10000</a>
%F A189172 a(n) = max(A087039(n), A007917(A000196(A006530(n)))).
%e A189172 A(22) is 3, because after 3 is tried, it is clear that 11 is prime and no more factorization can be done.
%e A189172 A(18) is 3, because despite the largest prime factor (3) being obviously prime, it is not obviously the last factor until the first 3 is factored out.

%o A189172 (JavaScript) prime(k), not shown, gives A000040[k].
