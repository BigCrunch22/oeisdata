%N A189967 Decimal expansion of (7+sqrt(105))/4, which has periodic continued fractions [4,3,4,1,4,3,4,1...] and [7/2, 1, 7/2, 1, ...].
%C A189967 Let R denote a rectangle whose shape (i.e., length/width) is (7+sqrt(105))/4.  This rectangle can be partitioned into squares in a manner that matches the continued fraction [4,3,4,1,4,3,4,1...].  It can also be partitioned into rectangles of shape 3/2 and 3 so as to match the continued fraction [7/2, 1, 7/2, 1, ...].  For details, see A188635.
