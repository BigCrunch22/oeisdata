%N A189827 a(n) = d(n-1) + d(n+1), where d(k) is the number of divisors of k.
%C A189827 d(n-1) + d(n+1) is a measure of the compositeness of the numbers next to n. Sequence A189825 lists the first occurrence of each number.
%C A189827 It is conjectured that every number greater than 3 occurs an infinite number of times. Note that an infinite number of 4's is equivalent to there being an infinite number of twin primes (A001097). An infinite number of 5's is equivalent to there being an infinite number of primes of the form p^2-2 (A028871) or p^2+2 (A056899) for prime p. An infinite number of 6's is equivalent to there being an infinite number of primes of the form p^3-2 (A066878), p^3+2 (A048636), p*q-2 (A063637), or p*q+2 (A063638), where p and q are distinct primes.
