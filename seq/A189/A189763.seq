%N A189763 Even numbers n such that solutions to x' = n are not all semiprimes, where x' denotes the arithmetic derivative (A003415).
%C A189763 It appears that the anti-derivatives of even numbers n are overwhelmingly semiprimes of the form (n/2)^2 - k^2. For example, 1000 has 28 anti-derivatives, all semiprimes.
