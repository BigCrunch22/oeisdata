%N A189038 Decimal expansion of (9+sqrt(17))/8.
%C A189038 Decimal expansion of the shape (= length/width = ((9+sqrt(17))/8) of the greater (9/4)-contraction rectangle.
%C A189038 See A188738 for an introduction to lesser and greater r-contraction rectangles, their shapes, and partitioning these rectangles into a sets of squares in a manner that matches the continued fractions of their shapes.
%C A189038 This number - 1, namely w = (1 + sqrt(17))/8 = 0.6403882032..., is the positive real root of 4*x^2 - x - 1, with negative root -(-1 + sqrt(17))/8 = -0.3903882032... = -(w - 1/4).  - _Wolfdieter Lang_, Dec 12 2022
