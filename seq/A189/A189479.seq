%N A189479 Fixed point starting with 0 of the morphism 0->01, 1->101.
%C A189479 Is this a shifted version of A114986 or A096270? - _R. J. Mathar_, May 16 2011
%C A189479 Response:  A189479(n)=A114986(n-1) for n>=2; this follows from formulas at A099267 (the positions of 1 in A189479) and the fact that A114986 is the characteristic function of the lower Wythoff sequence with 0 prefixed. - _Clark Kimberling_, May 22 2011
