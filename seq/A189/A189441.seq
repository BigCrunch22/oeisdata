%N A189441 Primes that are the arithmetic derivative (A003415) of some number.
%C A189441 Complement of A189483 in the primes. Sequence A157037 has the numbers that produce these primes. It is possible for several numbers to produce the same prime. In fact, for each of these primes there is a tree of numbers whose (perhaps multiple) derivatives equal the prime.
%C A189441 Every upper twin prime is here because for such p, the derivative of 2(p-2) is p.
