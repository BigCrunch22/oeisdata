%C A189687 From _Danny Rorabaugh_, Mar 14 2015: (Start)
%C A189687 Let x(i) and y(i) be the number of 0's and 1's, respectively, after the i-th stage of generating this word, so x(0) = 1, y(0) = 0, x(i+1) = x(i) + y(i), and y(i+1) = 2x(i) + y(i). Equivalently: x(0) = 1, x(1) = 1, x(i+2) = 2x(i+1) + x(i), y(0) = 0, y(1) = 2, and y(i+2) = 2y(i+1) + y(i).
%C A189687 The number of 0's after the i-th stage is x(i) = A001333(i).
%C A189687 The number of 1's after the i-th stage is y(i) = 2*A000129(i) = A163271(i+1) = A001333(i+1) - A001333(i).
%C A189687 Let S(n) = Sum_{j<=n} a(j) be the partial sums of this sequence, so S(x(i)+y(i)) = y(i). Consequently, if the Cesàro sum of a(n) exists, then it is lim_{n->infinity} S(n)/n = lim_{i->infinity} A163271(i+1)/A001333(i+1) = 2 - sqrt(2).
%C A189687 (End)
%C A189687 The Cesàro sum of (a(n)) DOES exist. It is well known that the frequencies of letters exist in sequences generated by (primitive) morphisms. The frequencies are given by the normalized right eigenvector (belonging to the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue) of the incidence matrix of the morphism. - _Michel Dekking_, Feb 02 2017
