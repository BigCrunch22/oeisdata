%N A189026 There appear to be at least n primes in the range (x-sqrt(x), x] for all x >= a(n).
%C A189026 These terms exist only if a strong form of Oppermann's conjecture that for any k>1 there is a prime between k^2-k and k^2 is true. Note that every term is prime. Sequence A189024 gives the number of primes in the range (x-sqrt(x), x]. The index of the prime a(n), that is, primepi(a(n)), is approximately (2.4*n)^2. These primes are generated in a manner similar to the Ramanujan primes (A104272).
