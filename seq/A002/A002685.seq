%C A002685 This is the main diagonal of A324124 (which is essentially the table on p. 217 in Luke (1952)), except that a(7) = 766808 must be replaced with 766808/7 = 109544. This is necessary to give a unique definition to the terms of A324124. For more information, see the comments for A324124.
%C A002685 Luke (1952) is not wrong (since 766808/4054050 = 109544/579150), but his integers for the case n = 7 have to modified as mentioned in the documentation of array A324124. For an improved version of this sequence, see A328884. (End)
