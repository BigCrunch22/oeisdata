%N A002875 Sorting numbers (see Motzkin article for details).
%C A002875 How is the sequence defined (see the links in A000262)?  Also more terms would be welcome.
%C A002875 Based on the Motzkin article, where this sequence appears in the last row of the table on p. 173, one would expect that this sequence is the same as A294202. However, they seem to be unrelated. So the true definition of this sequence is a mystery. - _Andrew Howroyd_ and _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Oct 25 2017
