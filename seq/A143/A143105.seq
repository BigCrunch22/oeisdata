%N A143105 Let g_0(x,y)=x, g_1(x,y)=x^3+3xy and g_{n+2}(x,y) = (x^2+2y)g_{n+1}(x+y)-y^2g_n(x,y). The entries of the sequence are those odd d for which g_d(x,y) and cx^jy^kg_m(x,y) have at least two terms in common (same coefficients) for some c > 0 and integers j,k and such that g_d(x,y) + cx^jy^k(1+y^m - g_m(x,y)) has all positive coefficients.
%C A143105 Note that g_k(x,y) always has positive coefficients. The sequence are degrees for which a certain construction (see paper by D'Angelo-Lebl) of proper monomial holomorphic mappings of balls does not give new noninvariant monomial mappings.
%C A143105 It is unknown if this sequence is infinite (conjectured to be so). Furthermore A143106 is definitely a subsequence of this sequence, but it is unknown if the two are in fact equal.

%e A143105 For example when d=7, we get the following new polynomials x^7 + 7/2 xy + 7/2 x^5y 7/2 xy^5 and x^7 + 7 x^3y + 7 xy^3 + 7 x^3y^3. Hence 7 is not in the sequence.
