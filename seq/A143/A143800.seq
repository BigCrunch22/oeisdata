%N A143800 In acoustics, using 12-tone equal temperament, the rounded number of semitones in the interval perceived when a vibrating string is divided into n congruent segments.
%C A143800 In music, these are known as harmonics.
%C A143800 Observe that log_2(n) produces irrational numbers for all n that are not powers of 2, and that dividing a string in half produces an octave interval.
%C A143800 Therefore the only harmonics that are perfectly in tune (equal to an interval in 12-TET) are the octaves, which correspond to all harmonics n that are powers of 2.

%F A143800 a(n) = round(log_2(n)*12).
%e A143800 For n = 3, a(3) = round(log_2(3)*12) = round(19.0195500086539...) = 19 Therefore dividing a string in three equal parts will result in a tone approximately 19 semitones higher, or an octave and a perfect fifth.
