%N A143516 Array D of denominators of Best Remaining Approximates of x=(1+sqrt(5))/2, by antidiagonals.
%C A143516 (1) Row 1 of R consists of principal convergents to x.
%C A143516 (2) (row limits of R) = x; (column limits of R) = 0.
%C A143516 (3) Every positive integer occurs exactly once in D, so that as a sequence, A143516 is a permutation of the positive integers.
%F A143516 For any positive irrational number x, define an array D by successive rows as follows: D(n,k) = least positive integer q not already in D such that there exists an integer p such that 0 < |x - p/q| < |x - c/d| for every positive rational number c/d that has 0 < d < q. Thus p/q is the "best remaining approximate" of x when all better approximates are unavailable. For each q, define N(n,k)=p and R(n,k)=p/q. Then R is the "array of best remaining approximates of x," D is the corresponding array of denominators and N, of numerators.
