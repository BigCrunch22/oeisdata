%N A143265 a(n) = the smallest integer >= n such that all the distinct primes that divide n and a(n) together are members of a set of consecutive primes. In other words, a(n) is the smallest integer >= n such that n*a(n) is contained in sequence A073491.

%e A143265 20 is factored as 2^2 *5^1. Checking the integers >= 20: 20*20 is not factorable into consecutive primes, since 3 is missing. 21 is factored as 3^1 *7^1. Since the distinct primes that divide 20 and 21 (which are 2,3,5,7) form a set of consecutive primes, then a(20) = 21.
