%N A143073 Least number k such that the binary expansion of n*k has fewer ones than n, or 0 if no such k exists.
%C A143073 a(n)=0 indicates that n is a sturdy number (A125121); that is, no multiple of n has fewer ones than the binary expansion of n. If a(n)>0, n is a flimsy number (A005360). Compare with A143069.
