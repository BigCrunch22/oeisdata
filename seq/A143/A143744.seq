%N A143744 The number of steps needed to generate the next largest juggler number.
%C A143744 The juggler sequence: begin with a starting value x and if x is even, x <- [sqrt(x)] and if x is odd, x <- [sqrt(x^3)] and repeat until x = 1, save the starting value, max x and the number of steps needed to reach it.
