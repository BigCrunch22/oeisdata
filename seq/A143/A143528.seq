%N A143528 Array D of denominators of Best Remaining Upper Approximates of x=sqrt(2), by antidiagonals.
%C A143528 (1) Row 1 of R consists of the upper principal and upper intermediate convergents to x.
%C A143528 (2) (row limits of R) = x; (column limits of R) = 0.
%C A143528 (3) Every positive integer occurs exactly once in D, so that as a sequence, A143528 is a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A143528 (4) p=1+floor(q*r) for every p/q in R. Consequently, the terms of N are distinct and their ordered union is the sequence 1+A001951.
%C A143528 (5) Conjecture: Every (N(n,k+1)-N(n,k))/(D(n,k+1)-D(n,k)) is a lower principal convergent to x.
%C A143528 (6) Suppose n>=1 and p/q and s/t are consecutive terms in row n of R. Then (conjecture) p*t-q*s=n.
%D A143528 C. Kimberling, "Best lower and upper approximates to irrational numbers," Elemente der Mathematik 52 (1997) 122-126.
%F A143528 For any positive irrational number x, define an array D by successive rows as follows: D(n,k) = least positive integer q not already in D such that there exists an integer p such that 0 < p/q - x < c/d- x for every positive rational number c/d that has 0 < d < q. Thus p/q is the "best remaining upper approximate" of x when all better upper approximates are unavailable. For each q, define N(n,k)=p and R(n,k)=p/q. Then R is the "array of best remaining upper approximates of x," D is the corresponding array of denominators and N, of numerators.
