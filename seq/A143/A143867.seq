%N A143867 a(n) is the number of n-digit integers in which the first k digits are divisible by k-th prime. Leading zeros are not allowed.
%C A143867 For every 3-digit number, such a 4-digit number is guaranteed to exist - in a range of ten consecutive numbers, at least one of them must be divisible by 7. Since this is not true for 11 and greater, the number of eligible numbers goes down dramatically. 8757193191 and 6300846559 are the only 10-digit numbers to satisfy the requirements.
%e A143867 There are four one-digit numbers divisible by 2 (the even, nonzero numbers), so a(1) = 4.
%e A143867 For n = 2, the number must start with an even, nonzero digit and the second digit must make it divisible by 3, which gives 13 numbers: 21, 24, 27, 42, 45, 48, 60, 63, 66, 69, 81, 84 and 87. Appending a 0 or 5 to the end of any of these satisfies for a(3), so the count doubles to 26.
%Y A143867 Cf. A079206 (the actual integers).
