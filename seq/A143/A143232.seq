%N A143232 Sum of denominators of Egyptian fraction expansion of A004001(n) - n/2.
%C A143232 A004001 is the Hofstadter-Conway $10,000 Sequence and A004001(n) - n/2 is increasingly larger versions of the batrachion Blancmange function.

%F A143232 a(n) = Sum of denominators of Egyptian fraction expansion of A004001(n) - n/2 .
%F A143232 For practical purposes, a full Egyptian fraction algorithm is not necessary. Since the elements of A004001(n) - n/2 are either whole or their fractional part is .5, the sequence can be effected by a(n) = sefd(A004001(n) - n/2) with sefd(x) = x + 3 * (x - floor(x)) .
%e A143232 a(43) = 5 because A004001(43) = 25, so (A004001(43) - (43/2)) = 3.5 and the Egyptian fraction expansion of 3.5 is (1/1)+(1/1)+(1/1)+(1/2), so the denominators are 1,1,1,2 which sums to 5.
