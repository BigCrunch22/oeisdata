%N A143842 Table read by antidiagonals: T(n,k) is the number of strongly connected directed multigraphs with loops with n arcs and k vertices, which are transitive (the existence of a path between two points implies the existence of an arc between those two points).
%C A143842 Partial sums of the rows of A139625, i.e., T(n,k) = sum(T139625(n,p),p=0..k).
%C A143842 If k>=floor(sqrt(n)), T(n,k) = A139630(n).
