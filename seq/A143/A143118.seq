%N A143118 a(n) = the single multiple of A143117(n) such that n-th prime <= a(n) <= (n+1)th prime.
%e A143118 The 16th prime is 53 and the 17th prime is 59. So we will concern ourselves with the integers 53,54,55,56,57,58,59. 1 divides all these integers. 2 divides three of these integers (54,56,58). 3 divides 54 and 57. 4 divides just 56. So a(16) = 56.
%Y A143118 Cf. A143117.
