%N A143935 Number of primes between n^K and (n+1)^K, inclusive, where K=log(127)/log(16).
%C A143935 This value of K is conjectured to be the least possible such that there is at least one prime in the range n^k and (n+1)^k for all n>0 and k>=K. This value of K was found using exact interval arithmetic. For each n <= 300 and for each prime p in the range n to n^2, we computed an interval k(n,p) such that p is between n^k(n,p) and (n+1)^k(n,p). The intersection of all these intervals produces a list of 29 intervals. The last interval appears to be semi-infinite beginning with K, which is log(127)/log(16). See A143898 for the smallest number in the first interval.
%C A143935 My UBASIC program indicates no prime between 113.457 ... and 126.999 .... Next prime > 113 is 127. I would like someone to check this. - _Enoch Haga_, Sep 24 2008
%C A143935 It suffices to check members of floor(A002386^(1/k)). - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Feb 03 2011
%C A143935 The constant log(127)/log(16) is A194361. - _John W. Nicholson_, Dec 13 2013

%E A143935 My intention was to include the endpoints of the range. Using k=log(127)/log(16), the endpoint for n=15 is exactly 127, which is prime. - _T. D. Noe_, Sep 25 2008
