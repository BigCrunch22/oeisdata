%N A143107 Let H(2,d) be the space of polynomials p(x,y) of two variables with nonnegative coefficients such that p(x,y) = 1 whenever x + y = 1; a(n) is the number of different polynomials in H(2,d) with exactly n distinct monomials and of maximum degree, i.e., of degree 2n-3.
%C A143107 It is unknown if this sequence is bounded. For all n >= 4, a(n) is at least two. It is unknown if it is 2 for infinitely many n. It is unknown if it is always even for all n >= 2. Note that 2n-3 appears in A143106 if and only if a(n) is 1 or 2.
