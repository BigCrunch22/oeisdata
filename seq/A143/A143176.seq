%N A143176 a(1)=1. a(n) is the smallest positive multiple of n that has more divisors than a(n-1) has.

%e A143176 a(4)=12 has 6 divisors. Checking the multiples of 5: 1*5=5 has 2 divisors. 2*5=10 has 4 divisors. 3*5=15 has 4 divisors. 4*5=20 has 6 divisors. 5*5=25 has 3 divisors. So the first 5 positive multiples of 5 each have <= 6 divisors. But 6*5 = 30 has 8 divisors. And since 8 > 6, a(5) = 30.
