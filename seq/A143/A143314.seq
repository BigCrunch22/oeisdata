%N A143314 Number of hands of n cards containing a straight flush (for n=1 to 52).
%C A143314 With a regular deck of 52 playing cards (4 suits of 13 cards: 23456789TJQKA) a "straight flush" consists of 5 cards of the same suit with consecutive values. The ace (A) is considered to come either before the deuce (2) or after the king (K).
%C A143314 The first terms of the sequence are zero because there are no straight flushes in a hand of fewer than 5 cards.

%F A143314 The generating function is a polynomial: (1+x)^52 - ((1+x)^13 - x^5(1+x)(10 + 61x + 156x^2 + 215x^3 + 169x^4 + 65x^5 + 12x^6 + x^7))^4.
%e A143314 a(5) = 40 because each suit allows 10 straight flushes (2 of which contain an ace).
%e A143314 a(44) = 752538149 = C(52,44) - 1 because there's only one way to avoid a straight flush with 44 cards (namely, 2346789JQKA in every suit).
%e A143314 a(45) = 133784560 = C(52,45) because every hand of 45 cards (or more) includes a straight flush.
%e A143314 a(52) = 1 because there's only one "hand" of 52 cards.
