%N A143843 Number of graphs with n-connectivity which are minor-minimal intrinsically linked in the 3-dimensional real projective space RP^3.
%C A143843 Foisy et al. p. 17: "Unlike R3, where there are simple arguments showing that there are no minor-minimal intrinsically linked graphs with connectivity 0, 1, or 2, such graphs exist in projective space. Using careful combinatorics, one can show that there are 21 disconnected graphs [i.e. with 2-connectivity], 91 graphs with 1-connectivity and 469 graphs with 2-connectivity which are minor-minimal intrinsically linked in RP^3."
%C A143843 Abstract: We examine graphs that contain a nontrivial link in every embedding into real projective space, using a weaker notion of unlink than was used in [Flapan, Howards, Lawrence and Mellor]. We call such graphs intrinsically linked in RP^3. We fully characterize such graphs with connectivity 0,1 and 2. We also show that only one Petersen-family graph is intrinsically linked in RP3 and prove that K_7 minus any two edges is also minor-minimal intrinsically linked. In all, 594 graphs are shown to be minor-minimal intrinsically linked in
