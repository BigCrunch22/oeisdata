%N A143825 This sequence displays every positive integer exactly three times; there is one number between the first and second 1's and one number between the second and third 1's; two numbers between the first and second 2's and two numbers between the second and third 2's; ... n numbers between the first and second n's and n numbers between the second and third n's.
%C A143825 The sequence displaying every positive integer exactly twice is A026272. Construction method: we always fill the next empty "hole" with the smallest available integer. There is no proof that this sequence could go on forever. Terms computed by Gilles Sadowski.
