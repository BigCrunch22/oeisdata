%N A143745 The next largest juggler number.
%C A143745 The juggler sequence: begin with a starting value x and if x is even, x <- floor(sqrt(x)) and if x is odd, x <- floor(sqrt(x^3)) and repeat until x = 1, save the starting value, max x and the number of steps needed to reach it.
%C A143745 I have a b-file for this sequence for n=1,...,19 (all known values), but some a(n) values are much larger than 1000 digits.
