%N A143728 Triangle read by rows: termwise product of mu(n) and n-th row of A127368.
%C A143728 The operation A127368 * A128407 forms the termwise product of mu(n) and the n-th row of A127368: deleting all squares and changing the sign of primes to (-1).
%C A143728 Row sums = A143729: (1, 1, -1, -2, -4, -4, -3, -14,...)
%F A143728 Triangle read by rows, A127368 * A128407, 1<=k<=n; T(n,k) = {1<=k<=n, GCD(k,n)=1} * mu(k).
%e A143728 First few terms of the triangle = 1; 1, 0; 1, -2, 0; 1, 0, -3, 0; 1, -2, -3, 0, 0; 1, 0, 0, 0, -5, 0; 1, -2, -3, 0, -5, 6, 0; 1, 0, -3, 0, -5, 0, -7, 0; ... Example: row 7 = (1, -2, -3, 0, -5, 6, 0). We take row 7 of triangle A127368 which records the relative primes of 7 as: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0). Applying the termwise product of the first 7 terms of mu(k): (1, -1, -1, 0, -1, 1, -1), we get (1, -2, -3, 0, -5, 6, 0), noting that the "4" has been deleted.
