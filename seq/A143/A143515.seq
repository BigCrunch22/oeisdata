%N A143515 Array D of denominators of Best Remaining Upper Approximates of x=(1+sqrt(5))/2, by antidiagonals.
%C A143515 (1) Row 1 of R consists of upper principal convergents to x.
%C A143515 (2) (row limits of R) = x; (column limits of R) = 0.
%C A143515 (3) Every positive integer occurs exactly once in D, so that as a sequence, this is a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A143515 (4) p=1+floor(q*r) for every p/q in R. Consequently, the terms of N are distinct and their ordered union is 1+A000201.
%C A143515 (5) Conjecture: Every (N(n,k+1)-N(n,k))/(D(n,k+1)-D(n,k)) is a principal convergent to x.
%C A143515 (6) Suppose n>=1 and p/q and s/t are consecutive terms in row n of R. Then (conjecture) p*t-q*s=n.
%C A143515 In general, for irrational r, let {n*r} denote the fractional part of n*r. Define t(1,1) = 1, and t(1,n) = least k such that {k*r} > {t(1,n-1)*x} for n >= 2. Inductively, for m >= 2 and n >= 1, let t(m,1) be the least k not already defined as a term in the array, and for n >= 2, define t(m,n) = least k such that {k*r} > {t(m,n-1)*x and k has not previously been defined as a term. Thus, every row of (t(m,n)) is strictly increasing. For r = (1+sqrt(5))/2, the array (t(m,n) is D. - _Clark Kimberling_, Feb 21 2021

%F A143515 For any positive irrational number x, define an array D by successive rows as follows: D(n,k) = least positive integer q not already in D such that there exists an integer p such that 0 < p/q - x < c/d - x for every positive rational number c/d that has 0 < d < q. Thus p/q is the "best remaining upper approximate" of x when all better upper approximates are unavailable. For each q, define N(n,k)=p and R(n,k)=p/q. Then R is the "array of best remaining upper approximates of x," D is the corresponding array of denominators and N, of numerators.
