%N A143654 Array T(n,k) read by rows: number of binary bracelets with n beads, k of them 0, with 00 prohibited, (n >= 2, 0 <= k <= floor(n/2)).
%C A143654 The initial columns give A057427, A057427, A004526, A069905, A005232, A032279, A005513, A032280, A005514, A032281, A005515, A032282, A005516. Row sums give A129526.
%C A143654 A binary bracelet with n beads, k of them 0, with 00 prohibited has from 0 to floor(n/2) beads 0, i.e., 0 <= k <= floor(n/2). If n is even, the bracelet 0101...01 with n/2 beads of each kind does not have 00 and we cannot change any 1 of it to a 0. If n is odd we cannot change a 1 to a 0 in the bracelet 0101...011 with (n-1)/2 beads 0.
%C A143654 The number of binary bracelets with n beads, 0 <= k <= floor(n/2) of them 0 with 00 prohibited, is equal to the number of binary bracelets with n-k beads, k of them 0. See below.
%C A143654 Let B be a binary bracelet with n-k beads, k of them 0. If we insert one 1 (circularly) after a 0 of B, we obtain a bracelet with n-k+1 beads, k of them 0.
%C A143654 If we do this insertion k times, each time after a distinct 0 of B, we obtain a bracelet with n = n-k+k beads, k of them 0, with 00 prohibited.
%C A143654 On the contrary, Let B be a binary bracelet with n beads, k of them 0, with 00 prohibited. If we remove from B one 1 that is after a 0, we obtain a bracelet of n-1 beads, k of them 0. (If not and we undo the removal, the configuration obtained cannot be a bracelet and this is absurd.) If we repeat this removal k times, after each distinct bead 0, we obtain a bracelet with n-k beads, k of them 0.
