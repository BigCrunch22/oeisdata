%N A106505 Ordered and uniqued length of side common to the two angles, one being the double of the other, of a primitive integer-sided triangle.
%C A106505 The terms are proposed without repetition. For example, there exist two such triangles with a length of side = 33. They correspond respectively to s^2 - r^2 = 33 (see formula) with (r, s) = (4, 7) and sides (33, 28, 16), and the other triangle with (r, s) = (16, 17) and sides (33, 272, 256). Lengths = 39, 51, 57, 69, 75, ... correspond to two distinct triangles ... The lengths of these sides are proposed with repetition in A343064. - _Bernard Schott_, Apr 22 2021
%F A106505 Values s^2 - r^2, where r<s<2r and (r, s)=1.
%F A106505 Conjecture: for n>2, a(n+5) = a(n) + 8. - _Ralf Stephan_, Nov 16 2010.
%F A106505 Empirical g.f.: -x*(x^7+x^6+3*x^5-2*x^4-2*x^3-2*x^2-2*x-5) / ((x-1)^2*(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)). - _Colin Barker_, Oct 05 2013
