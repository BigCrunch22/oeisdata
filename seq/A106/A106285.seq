%N A106285 Number of orbits of the 3-step recursion mod n.
%C A106285 Consider the 3-step recursion x(k)=x(k-1)+x(k-2)+x(k-3) mod n. For any of the n^3 initial conditions x(1), x(2) and x(3) in Zn, the recursion has a finite period. Each of these n^3 vectors belongs to exactly one orbit. In general, there are only a few different orbit lengths (A106288) for each n. For instance, the orbits mod 8 have lengths of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. Interestingly, for n=2^k and n=3^k, the number of orbits appear to be A039301 and A054879, respectively.
