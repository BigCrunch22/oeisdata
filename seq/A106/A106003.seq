%C A106003 Could one say this is kind of fractal?
%C A106003 The definition seems to be the following: all terms have an odd number of digits, and are strictly increasing. Now delete all except the middle digits of each term. The result is the succession of digits of all the terms. We take the lexicographically earliest sequence satisfying these conditions. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 09 2012
