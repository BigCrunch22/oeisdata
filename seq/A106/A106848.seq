%N A106848 a(n) = the number of times the last digit of n must be appended to n to form a number m such that n divides m, or 0 if no such m exists.
%C A106848 Shares many terms in common with A064696, which involved inserting zeros between digits. Numbers which do not appear to be able to form a multiple (a(n)=0) were tested out to 10000 digits added. Note those values of n for which a(n)=0 (12, 16, 24, 25, 32, 36, 48, ...) appear to be given by A064695.
%e A106848 a(13) = 6 because the last digit of 13 must be appended to it six times before a new number which divides 13 is formed. (I.e., 133 mod 13 = 3, 1333 mod 13 = 7, 13333 mod 13 = 8, 133333 mod 13 = 5, 1333333 mod 13 = 6, 13333333 mod 13 = 0.) a(12)=0 because no matter how many 2's are appended to 12, the resulting number is not divisible by 12.
