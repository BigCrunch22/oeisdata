%N A106546 a(n) = n^2 if n^2 is the difference of two primes, otherwise a(n) = 0.
%C A106546 For odd n, n^2 is odd so the two primes must be opposite in parity. Lesser prime must be 2 and greater prime must be n^2+2. Thus for odd n, n^2 is the difference of two primes iff n^2+2 is prime.
%C A106546 An odd difference can be obtained only by subtracting 2 from some prime > 2, hence a(n) = 0 if n is odd and n^2+2 is composite.
%F A106546 n^2 - A106546 gives perfect squares which are not the difference of two primes (otherwise 0).
%e A106546 a(6) = 6^2 = 36 = 41-5 (two primes).
%e A106546 a(5) = 0 and a(7) = 0 because 5^2+2 =27 = 3*3*3 and 7^2+2 =51 = 3*17 are composite.
