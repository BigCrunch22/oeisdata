%N A106577 Indices n of perfect squares n^2 which are both the sum and the difference of two primes.
%F A106577 a(n) = SQRT(A106575(n)).
%e A106577 a(3)=4 because the third square which is the sum and the difference of two primes (16=4^2) is the 4th one in
%e A106577 the succession of the perfect squares (thus: index 4).
