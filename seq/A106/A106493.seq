%N A106493 Total number of bases and exponents in GF(2)[X] Superfactorization of n, excluding the unity-exponents at the tips of branches.
%C A106493 GF(2)[X] Superfactorization proceeds in a manner analogous to normal superfactorization explained in A106490, but using factorization in domain GF(2)[X], instead of normal integer factorization in N.

%e A106493 a(64) = 3, as 64 = A048723(2,6) = A048723(2,(A048723(2,1) X A048723(3,1))) and there are three non-1 nodes in that superfactorization. Similarly, for 27 = 5x7 = A048723(3,2) X A048273(7,1) we get a(27) = 3. The operation X stands for GF(2)[X] multiplication defined in A048720, while A048723(n,y) raises the n-th GF(2)[X] polynomial to the y:th power.
%Y A106493 a(n) = A106490(A106445(n)). a(n) = A106494(n)-A106495(n).
