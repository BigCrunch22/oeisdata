%N A106004 First monotonically increasing sequence such that erasing the first and last digit of each term and concatenating what is left results in the concatenation of all terms of the sequence.
%C A106004 Could one say this is kind of fractal?
%e A106004 To avoid numbers beginning with 0, we assume the first term is 1xy, and so x=1, so 11y, but y=0 works, so the first term is 110.
%e A106004 The next two terms must be a1b, c0d, and se we take a=b=1, c=2, d=0, so now the sequence begins 110, 111, 200. And so on.
%Y A106004 Cf. A106003.
