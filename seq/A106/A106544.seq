%N A106544 Perfect squares n^2 which are not the sum of two primes (otherwise 0).
%C A106544 For odd n, n^2 is odd so the two primes must be opposite in parity. Lesser prime must be 2 and greater prime must be n^2-2. Thus for odd n, n^2 is the sum of two primes iff n^2-2 is prime. - _Ray Chandler_, May 12 2005
%F A106544 a(n) = n^2 - A106545(n).
%e A106544 a(10)=0 because 10^2=100=97+3 (sum of two primes)
%e A106544 a(11)=11^2=121, which is impossible to obtain summing two primes.
