%N A106449 Square array (P(x) XOR P(y))/gcd(P(x),P(y)) where P(x) and P(y) are polynomials with coefficients in {0,1} given by the binary expansions of x and y, and all calculations are done in polynomial ring GF(2)[X], with the result converted back to a binary number, and then expressed in decimal. Array is symmetric, and is read by antidiagonals.
%C A106449 Array is read by antidiagonals, with row x and column y ranging as: (x,y) = (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), ...
%C A106449 "Coded in binary" means that a polynomial a(n)*X^n+...+a(0)*X^0 over GF(2) is represented by the binary number a(n)*2^n+...+a(0)*2^0 in Z (where a(k)=0 or 1).
%C A106449 This is GF(2)[X] analog of A106448. In the definition XOR means addition in polynomial ring GF(2)[X], that is, a carryless binary addition, A003987.
