%F A106447 a(0)=0, a(1)=1. For irreducible GF(2)[X] polynomials ir_i with index i (i.e. A014580(i)), a(ir_i) = A000040(a(i)) and for composite polynomials n = A048723(ir_i, e_i) X A048723(ir_j, e_j) X A048723(ir_k, e_k) X ..., a(n) = a(ir_i)^a(e_i) * a(ir_j)^a(e_j) * a(ir_k)^a(e_k) * ... = A000040(a(i))^a(e_i) * A000040(a(j))^a(e_j) * A000040(a(k))^a(e_k), where X stands for carryless multiplication of GF(2)[X] polynomials (A048720) and A048723(n, y) raises the n-th GF(2)[X] polynomial to the y:th power, while * is the ordinary multiplication and ^ is the ordinary exponentiation.
%e A106447 a(5) = 9, as 5 encodes the GF(2)[X] polynomial x^2+1, which is the square of the second irreducible GF(2)[X] polynomial x+1 (encoded as 3), a(2)=2 and the square of the second prime is 3^2=9. a(13) = a(A014580(5)) = A000040(a(5)) = A000040(9) = 23. a(32) = a(A048723(2,5)) = a(2)^a(5) = 2^9 = 512. a(48) = a(3 X A048723(2,4)) = a(3) * a(2)^a(4) = 3 * 2^4 = 3 * 16 = 48.
