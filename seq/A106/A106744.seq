%N A106744 Given n shoelaces, each with two aglets; sequence gives number of aglet pairs that must be picked up to guarantee that the probability that no shoelace is left behind is > 1/2.

%e A106744 a(2)=2 because given 2 shoelaces, p=1/3 that the first two aglets picked up will be on a single shoelace, requiring another pick-up and p=2/3 that they won't, so the mean no. of pick-ups is (1/3)*2 + (2/3)*1 = 4/3, for which the ceiling is 2.
