%N A106529 Numbers having k prime factors (counted with multiplicity), the largest of which is the k-th prime.
%C A106529 It seems that the ratio between successive terms tends to 1 as n increases, meaning perhaps that most numbers are in this sequence.
%C A106529 The number of terms that have the k-th prime as their largest prime factor is A000984(k), the k-th central binomial coefficient. E.g., 6 and 9 are the A000984(2)=2 terms in {a(n)} that have prime(2)=3 as their largest prime factor.
%C A106529 The sequence contains the positive integers m such that the rank of the partition B(m) = 0. For m >= 2, B(m) is defined as the partition obtained by taking the prime decomposition of m and replacing each prime factor p with its index i (i.e., i-th prime = p); also B(1) = the empty partition. For example, B(350) = B(2*5^2*7) = [1,3,3,4]. B is a bijection between the positive integers and the set of all partitions. The rank of a partition P is the largest part of P minus the number of parts of P. - _Emeric Deutsch_, May 09 2015
%C A106529 Also Heinz numbers of balanced partitions, counted by A047993. The Heinz number of an integer partition (y_1,...,y_k) is prime(y_1)*...*prime(y_k). - _Gus Wiseman_, Feb 08 2021

%F A106529 For all terms, A001222(a(n)) = A061395(a(n)). - _Gus Wiseman_, Feb 08 2021
%e A106529 a(7)=50 because 50=2*5*5 is, for k=3, the product of k primes, the largest of which is the k-th prime, and 50 is the 7th such number.
