%N A106044 Difference between n-th prime and next larger perfect square.
%C A106044 Can be read as a table, since there are always several primes between two squares, although this is the yet unproved Legendre's conjecture, cf. A014085. Whenever a(n+1) > a(n), the n-th prime is the largest one below a given square and prime(n+1) is the smallest prime larger than that square. For n > 1, these are also the indices where the parity of the terms changes. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 19 2018

%e A106044 Written as a table, starting a new row when a square is reached, the sequence reads:
%e A106044   2, 1,  // 4 - {2, 3: primes between 1^2 = 1 and 2^2 = 4}
%e A106044   4, 2,   // 9 - {5, 7: primes between 2^2 = 4 and 3^2 = 9}
%e A106044   5, 3,    // 16 - {11, 13: primes between 3^2 = 9 and 4^2 = 16}
%e A106044   8, 6, 2,  // 25 - {17, 19, 23: primes between 4^2 = 16 and 5^2 = 25}
%e A106044   7, 5,      // 36 - {29, 31: primes between 5^2 = 25 and 6^2 = 36}
%e A106044   12, 8, 6, 2,// 49 - {37, 41, 43, 47: primes between 6^2 = 36 and 7^2 = 49}
