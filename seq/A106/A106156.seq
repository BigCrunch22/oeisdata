%N A106156 Pi pseudo-golombization. Size of the chunks of Pi's decimal digits (including the first "3") is given by the digits themselves.
%C A106156 Two problems arise: what would be a "size 0" chunk (the 33rd digit of Pi is a 0)? This has been fixed by linking the responsible 0 digit to its immediate predecessor, thus leading to a chunk of 10 or more digits in the "golombization". Second problem: what if some chunks have a leading zero? This has been fixed by the same procedure: the responsible digit of Pi is linked to its predecessor, thus producing a larger chunk (this explains why the 15th chunk of the sequence is 93 digits long: the 9-digit-long chunk would fit (164062862), but the following 3-digit-long chunk would start with a 0 (089)).
