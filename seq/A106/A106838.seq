%N A106838 Numbers n such that n, n+1 and n+2 have odd part of form 4k+3.
%C A106838 Either of form 2a(m)+2 or 32k+22, k>=0, 0<m<n.
%C A106838 Number points of the Heighway/Harter dragon curve starting m=0 at the origin.  Those m with odd part 4k+3 (A091067) are where the curve turns right.  So this sequence is the first m of each run of 3 consecutive right turns.  There are no runs of 4 or more since the turn at odd m alternates left and right.  Bates, Bunder, and Tognetti (Theorem 19, page 104), show the last of each run is integers of the form 2^p*(4k+3) with p>=3.  So here the first of each run is a(n) = 8*A091067(n)-2 as Ralf Stephan already noted. - _Kevin Ryde_, Mar 12 2020

%e A106838 22/2=11 is 3 mod 4 and so is 23 and 24/8=3, thus 22 is in sequence.
