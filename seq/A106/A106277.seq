%N A106277 Number of distinct zeros of x^4-x^3-x^2-x-1 mod prime(n).
%C A106277 This polynomial is the characteristic polynomial of the Fibonacci and Lucas 4-step sequences, A000078 and A073817. Similar polynomials are treated in Serre's paper. The discriminant of the polynomial is -563 and 563 is the only prime for which the polynomial has 3 distinct zeros. The primes p yielding 4 distinct zeros, A106280, correspond to the periods of the sequences A000078(k) mod p and A073817(k) mod p having length less than p. The Lucas 4-step sequence mod p has one additional prime p for which the period is less than p: the discriminant 563. For this prime, the Fibonacci 4-step sequence mod p has a period of p(p-1).
