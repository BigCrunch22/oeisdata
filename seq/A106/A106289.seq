%N A106289 Number of different orbit lengths of the 4-step recursion mod n.
%C A106289 Consider the 4-step recursion x(k)=x(k-1)+x(k-2)+x(k-3)+x(k-4) mod n. For any of the n^4 initial conditions x(1), x(2), x(3) and x(4) in Zn, the recursion has a finite period. Each of these n^4 vectors belongs to exactly one orbit. In general, there are only a few different orbit lengths for each n. For n=8, there are 4 different lengths: 1, 5, 10 and 20. The maximum possible length of an orbit is the period of the Fibonacci 4-step sequence mod n, which is essentially A106295(n).
