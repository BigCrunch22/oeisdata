%N A106002 a(n)=1 if there is a number of the form 6k+3 such that prime(n) < 6k+3 < prime(n+1), otherwise 0.
%C A106002 Except for first two primes and twin primes, there is always at least one number of the form 6k+3 between two successive primes.
%e A106002 a(3)=0 because between prime(3)=5 and prime(4)=7 there are no numbers of the form 6k+3;
%e A106002 a(4)=1 because between prime(4)=7 and prime(5)=11 there is 9=6*1+3.
%Y A106002 Same as A100810 after first term.
