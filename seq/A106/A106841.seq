%N A106841 Numbers m such that m, m+1 and m+2 have odd part of the form 4*k+1.
%C A106841 Either of form 2a(m) or 32k + 8, k >= 0, 0 < m < n.
%C A106841 Number points of the Heighway/Harter dragon curve starting m=0 at the origin.  Those m with odd part 4k+1 (A091072) are where the curve turns left.  So this sequence is the first m of each run of 3 consecutive left turns.  There are no runs of 4 or more since the turn at odd m alternates left and right.  Bates, Bunder, and Tognetti (theorem 19 page 104), show this sequence is integers of the form 2^p*(4k+1) with p>=3.  From which a(n) = 8*A091072(n) as Ralf Stephan already noted. - _Kevin Ryde_, Jan 28 2020
%C A106841 The asymptotic density of this sequence is 1/16. - _Amiram Eldar_, Sep 14 2024

%e A106841 40/8 = 5 is 1 mod 4 and so is 41 and 42/2 = 21, thus 40 is in sequence.
