%N A106574 Indices n of perfect squares n^2 which are neither the sum nor the difference of two primes.
%F A106574 a(n) = sqrt(A106573(n)).
%e A106574 a(2)=17 because the second square which is nor the sum nor the difference of two primes (289=17^2) is the 17th one in the succession of the perfect squares (thus: index 17).
