%N A106482 Number of prime factors (with multiplicity) of the Stella Octangula numbers A007588.
%C A106482 Because of the polynomial factorization, the Stella Octangula numbers can never be prime. They are semiprime when n = is prime and 2*n^2-1 is also prime. That is, the n-th Stella Octangula number is semiprime for n = 2, 3, 7, 11, 13, 17, 41, 43, 59, 73, 109, 113, 127, 137, 157, 179, 181, 197, 199, ...; that sequence is A106483.

%e A106482 73*(2*73^2 - 1) = 777961 = 73 * 10657, which has two prime factors, so a(73) = 2.
%e A106482 100*(2*100^2 - 1) = 1999900 = 2^2 * 5^2 * 7 * 2857 has 6 prime factors.
