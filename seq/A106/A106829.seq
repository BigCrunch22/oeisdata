%N A106829 Given n shoelaces, each with two aglets; sequence gives number of aglets that must be picked up to guarantee that the probability that no shoelace is left behind is > 1/2.
%C A106829 An aglet is a tag or sheath on the end of a lace to facilitate its passing through eyelet holes.
%C A106829 There are C(2n,k) ways of picking up k aglets out of 2*n aglets. All of them are equally likely. Picking up k aglets leaves 2n - k aglets not picked up. Each of these 2n - k aglets must be on a different shoelace in order to get all the shoelaces. There are C(n,2n - k) combinations of shoelaces with a not-picked aglet.
%C A106829 Each not-picked aglet can be on either end, so we multiply C(n,2n - k) by 2^(2n - k) for a total of 2^(2n - k) * C(n,2n - k) ways to get all the shoelaces. So we want So 2^(2n - k) * C(n,2n - k) > (1/2) * C(2n,k).
%C A106829 The following PARI code can be used to calculate k, it solves for 50% probability, pretending that the problem is continuous, then takes the ceiling to get to the realistic k value required.
%C A106829 Fieggen's site has pictures of aglets (and hints on repairing them). - _N. J. A. Sloane_ May 16 2005
