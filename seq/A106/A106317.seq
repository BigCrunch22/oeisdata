%N A106317 Numbers n such that the remainder of the harmonic residue of n when divided by n is n-1.
%F A106317 It appears that n is in the sequence iff n is prime or n is in {1, 21, 822857} (Verified to 3.1*10^6). It is true that if n is the product of two distinct primes, then n=21. - George J. Schaeffer (gschaeff(AT)andrew.cmu.edu), Apr 30 2005, _R. J. Mathar_, Jan 25 2017
