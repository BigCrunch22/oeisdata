%N A106265 Numbers a > 0 such that the Diophantine equation a + b^2 = c^3 has integer solutions b and c.
%C A106265 A given a(n) can have multiple solutions with distinct (b,c), e.g., a=4 with b=2, c=2 (4 + 2^2 = 2^3) or with b=11, c=5 (4 + 11^2 = 5^3). (See also A181138.) Sequences A106266 and A106267 list the minimal values. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 04 2013
%C A106265 The cubes A000578 = (1,8,27,64,...) form a subsequence of this sequence, corresponding to b=0, a=c^3. If b=0 is excluded, these terms are not present, except for a few exceptions, a = 216, 343, 12167, ... (6^3 + 28^2 = 10^3, 7^3 + 13^2 = 8^3, 23^3 + 588^2 = 71^3, ...), cf. A038597 for the possible b-values. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 05 2013
%C A106265 This is the complement of A081121. The values do indeed correspond to solutions listed in Gebel's file. - _M. F. Hasler_, Oct 05 2013
%C A106265 Needs b-file corrected.
