%N A106444 Exponent-recursed cross-domain bijection from N to GF(2)[X]. Variant of A091202 and A106442.
%C A106444 This map from the multiplicative domain of N to that of GF(2)[X] preserves 'superfactorized' structures, e.g. A106490(n) = A106493(a(n)), A106491(n) = A106494(a(n)), A064372(n) = A106495(a(n)). Shares with A091202 and A106442 the property that maps A000040(n) to A014580(n). Differs from A091202 for the first time at n=32, where A091202(32)=32, while a(32)=128. Differs from A106442 for the first time at n=48, where A106442(48)=192, while a(48)=48. Differs from A106446 for the first time at n=11, where A106446(11)=25, while a(11)=13.

%F A106444 a(0)=0, a(1)=1, a(p_i) = A014580(i) for primes p_i with index i and for composites n = p_i^e_i * p_j^e_j * p_k^e_k * ..., a(n) = A048723(a(p_i), a(e_i)) X A048723(a(p_j), a(e_j)) X A048723(a(p_k), a(e_k)) X ..., where X stands for carryless multiplication of GF(2)[X] polynomials (A048720) and A048723(n, y) raises the n-th GF(2)[X] polynomial to the y:th power.
%e A106444 a(5) = 7, as 5 is the 3rd prime and the third irreducible GF(2)[X] polynomial x^2+x+1 is encoded as A014580(3) = 7. a(32) = a(2^5) = A048723(A014580(1),a(5)) = A048723(2,7) = 128. a(48) = a(3 * 2^4) = 3 X A048723(2,a(4)) = 3 X A048723(2,4) = 3 X 16 = 48.
