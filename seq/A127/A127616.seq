%N A127616 a(n) = denominator of the continued fraction which has the positive integers which are <= n and are coprime to n as its terms. The terms are written in order from n-1 for the integer part, to 1 for the final term of the continued fraction.
%e A127616 The positive integers coprime to 8 and <= 8 are 1,3,5,7. So a(8) is the denominator of 7 +1/(5 +1/(3 +1/1)) = 151/21.
