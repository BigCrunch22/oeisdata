%N A127178 Primes whose "Look And Say" descriptions from right to left (in the sense of method B, i.e., digit-indication followed by frequency) are also primes.
%e A127178 71, 499 and 1223, for instance, belong to the sequence because their respective descriptions 1171 (1 once, 7 once), 9241 (9 twice, 4 once), 312211 (3 once, 2 twice, 1 once) are all primes.
