%N A127742 Triangle read by rows with shape A000041 which refines the Catalan triangle A033184 using sequence A048996.
%C A127742 Contribution from _R. J. Mathar_, Jul 16 2010: (Start)
%C A127742 The entries count Dyck paths of length 2n which have a step/stride pattern between consecutive returns to the horizontal axes (after sorting) equivalent to the k-th partition of n.
%C A127742 Equivalent means that each distance between two x (where y=0) is divided by 2 prior to comparison.
%C A127742 Example: if the x-values are (0,4,8,10,16) with 2n=16, the strides are 4,4,2,6, equal to 2,2,1,3 after division by 2, and contribute to the 1^1,2^2,3^1 partition T(8,14). (End)
