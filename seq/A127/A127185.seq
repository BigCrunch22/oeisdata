%N A127185 Triangle of distances between n>=1 and n>=m>=1 measured by the number of non-common prime factors.
%C A127185 Consider the non-directed graph where each integer n >= 1 is a unique node labeled by n and where nodes n and m are connected if their list of exponents in their prime number decompositions n=p_1^n_1*p_2^n_2*... and m=p_1^m_1*p_2^m_2*... differs at one place p_i by 1. [So connectedness means n/m or m/n is a prime.] The distance between two nodes is defined by the number of hops on the shortest path between them. [Actually, the shortest path is not unique if the graph is not pruned to a tree by an additional convention like connecting only numbers that differ in the exponent of the largest prime factors; this does not change the distance here.] The formula says this can be computed by passing by the node of the greatest common divisor.

%e A127185 T(8,10)=T(2^3,2*5)=3 as one must lower the power of p_1=2 two times and rise the power of p_3=5 once to move from 8 to 10. A shortest path is 8<->4<->2<->10 obtained by division through 2, division through 2 and multiplication by 5.
