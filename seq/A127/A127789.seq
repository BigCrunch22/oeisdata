%N A127789 Record indices of 2^h(n)/(3^t(n)*n), where h and t are the number of halving resp. tripling steps in the '3x + 1' problem.
%C A127789 Original name: In the '3x + 1' problem we would expect a positive integer n to be approximately equal to 2^j / 3^k where j is the number of halving steps and k is the number of '3x + 1' steps required to reach 1. The numbers in this sequence are those for which 2^j / (n*3^k) sets a new record.
%C A127789 Eric Roosendaal calls 2^j / (n*3^k) the residue of n and conjectures that 993 yields the highest residue. - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 08 2007
%C A127789 It has been verified that the next value, if it exists, is larger than 2^32 ~ 4.3e9. We do not need an "escape clause" (as for A006577, A006666, A006667, ...) in this sequence since the unlikely case of a possibly undefined ratio is irrelevant for the list of records. - _M. F.
