%N A127612 a(n) = denominator of the continued fraction which has the positive divisors of n as its terms. The terms are written in order from 1 for the integer part, to n for the final term of the continued fraction.
%e A127612 The divisors of 6 are 1,2,3,6. So a(6) is the denominator of 1 +1/(2 +1/(3 +1/6)) = 63/44.
