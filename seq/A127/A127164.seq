%N A127164 Integers whose aliquot sequences terminate by encountering the prime 7. Also known as the prime family 7.
%C A127164 This sequence is complete only as far as the last term given, for the eventual fate of the aliquot sequence generated by 276 is not (yet) known.

%F A127164 Define s(i)=sigma(i)-i=A000203(i)-i. Then if the aliquot sequence obtained by repeatedly applying the mapping i->s(i) terminates by encountering the prime 7 as a member of its trajectory, i is included in this sequence.
%e A127164 a(5)=20 because the fifth integer whose aliquot sequence terminates by encountering the prime 7 as a member of its trajectory is 20. The complete aliquot sequence generated by iterating the proper divisors of 15 is 20->22->14->10->8->7->1->0
