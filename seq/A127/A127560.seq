%N A127560 Number of fixed r-celled polyominoes with smallest containing rectangle measuring k by m, read in order r=A056556(n)+1, k=A056560(n)+1, m=A056558(n)+1.
%C A127560 The sum of each triangle, i.e. for a given r the sum of a(n) for all n such that r=A056556(n)+1 is the number of r-celled fixed polyominoes, A001168(r).
%e A127560 The 5th triangle of the sequence, the number of fixed pentominoes by dimension, is

%e A127560 0,6,25
%e A127560 0,12
%e A127560 1
%e A127560 This indicates, for example, there are 25 fixed pentominos that fit in a 3 X 3 rectangle and 12 fixed pentominos that fit in a 4 X 2 rectangle.
