%N A127933 Number of halving and tripling steps to reach 1 from the n-th pure hailstone number in the '3x+1' problem.
%C A127933 Previous name was: A006577(k), k = pure hailstone numbers from A061641.
%C A127933 Impure hailstone numbers are those which occur in the trajectories of smaller numbers. Thus 5 is impure since it occurs in the trajectory of 3.
