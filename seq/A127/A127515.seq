%N A127515 a(n) is the smallest positive integer which does not occur earlier in the sequence and is such that sum{k=1 to n} 1/a(k) has a numerator which is prime (or is 1).
%C A127515 A127516(n)/A127517(n) is sum{k=1 to n} 1/a(k). This sequence, A127515, seems to be a permutation of the positive integers.
%e A127515 1/a(1) + 1/a(2) +1/a(3) = 1 +1/2 + 1/3 = 11/6. 11/6 + 1/4 = 25/12; but 25 is composite, so a(4) is not 4. But 11/6 +1/5 = 61/30. And since 61 is prime, then a(4) = 5.
