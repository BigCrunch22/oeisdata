%N A127875 Numbers x for which (x^3)/2+(3x^2)/2+3x+3 is prime.
%C A127875 Generating polynomial is Schur's polynomial of degree 3. Schur's polynomials n degree are n-th first term of series expansion of e^x function. All polynomials are non-reducible and belonging to the An alternating Galois transitive group if n is divisible by 4 or to Sn symmetric Galois Group in other case (proof Schur, 1930).
