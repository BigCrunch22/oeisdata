%N A127792 a(0)=1; for n>0, a(n) = Sum_{k|n} (number of earlier terms which are coprime to k).
%e A127792 The positive divisors of 8 are 1,2,4,8. So a(8) = (the number of earlier terms coprime to 1, which is 8) + (the number of earlier terms coprime to 2, which is 3 for a(0)=1, a(1)=1 and a(6) = 15) + (the number of earlier terms coprime to 4, which is 3) + (the number of earlier terms coprime to 8, which is 3) = 8 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 17.
