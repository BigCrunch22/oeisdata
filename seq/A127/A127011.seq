%N A127011 a(1)=1. a(n) = the numerator of the sum of the reciprocals of the earlier terms of the sequence which divide n.
%e A127011 The sequence's terms, among terms a(1) through a(9), which divide 10 are a(1)=1, a(2)=1, a(3)=2, a(4)=5, a(6)=5 and a(7)=2. So a(10) is the numerator of 1 +1 +1/2 +1/5 +1/5 +1/2 = 17/5, which is 17.
