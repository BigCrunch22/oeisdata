%N A127703 Primes of the form 7*2^k-3 or 7*2^k+3.
%C A127703 This sequence lists the primes produced by the sum of three consecutive powers of 2 minus 3 or plus 3, 2^k+2^(k+1)+2^(k+2)+-3, generated by k = 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 21, 23, 24, 30, 33...
%C A127703 In 76 trials from k=0 to 37, 19 primes, 34 semiprimes, and 23 numbers requiring more than two different prime factors were produced. This differs from the distribution of such numbers. Starting at k=16 the final digits of the sum are the powers  of 2 from 1 to 13.
%e A127703 2^5 + 2^6 + 2^7=224, then 224-3=221=semiprime 13*17 (not contributing to the sequence) or 224+3=prime 227, an entry in the sequence.
