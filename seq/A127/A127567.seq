%N A127567 Given k, the product of the first n primes and starting with the first prime at least 3 greater than k, a(n) is the number of consecutive primes where p-k is also prime.
%H A127567 <a href="http://h.xerol.org/f/1primecheck.txt">http://h.xerol.org/f/1primecheck.txt</a>Shows applicable sequences of primes for n = 2..9
%e A127567 For n = 2, k = 2*3 = 6. The first prime at least 3 greater than 6 is 11.
%e A127567 11-6 = 5, 13-6 = 7, 17-6 = 11, 19-6 = 13, 23-6 = 17, 29-6 = 23, all of which are primes. 31-6 = 25 is not prime, so a(2) = 6 because there are 6 prime terms.
