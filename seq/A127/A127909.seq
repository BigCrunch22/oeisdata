%N A127909 Number of different digraphs on n unlabeled nodes which are not graphs.
%C A127909 A digraph is (isomorphic to) a graph if every pair of points a, b joined by a directed edge (a,b) also has the reverse directed edge (b,a). A digraph which is not a graph is a digraph with at least one pair of points which have only one directed edge connecting them.
%F A127909 a(n) = A000273(n) - A000088(n).
%e A127909 a(2) = 1 because with two points a and b, either there are no edges connecting them, or there is one directed edge between them, or there is a bidirectional pair of edges between them; only the case with one directed edge is the unique 2-point digraph which is not a graph.
%e A127909 a(3) = 12 because A000273(3) = number of directed graphs (or digraphs) with 3 nodes = 16; A000088(3) = number of graphs on 3 unlabeled nodes = 4; 16-4 = 12.
%Y A127909 Cf. A000088, A000273, A127910-A127915.
