%N A127562 a(1)=1. a(2)=2. For n>=3, a(n) is the smallest positive integer not occurring earlier in the sequence such that (Sum_{k=1..n} a(k)) divides Product_{j=1..n} a(j).
%C A127562 Is this a permutation of the positive integers?

%e A127562 a(1)+a(2)+a(3)+a(4)+a(5)+a(6) = 1+2+3+6+4+8 = 24. a(1)*a(2)*a(3)*a(4)*a(5)*a(6) = 1152. And 24 divides 1152. Had a(6) been any of the positive integers which are < 8 and do not occur earlier in the sequence (i.e., had it been 5 or 7), then the sum of the first 6 terms of the sequence would not have divided the product of the first 6 terms.
