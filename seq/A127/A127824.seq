%N A127824 Triangle in which row n is a sorted list of all numbers having total stopping time n in the Collatz (or 3x+1) iteration.
%C A127824 The length of each row is A005186(n). The largest number in row n is 2^n. The second-largest number in row n is A000975(n-2) for n>4. The smallest number in row n is A033491(n). The Collatz conjecture asserts that every positive integer occurs in some row of this triangle.
%C A127824 n is an element of row number A006577(n). - _Reinhard Zumkeller_, Oct 03 2012
%C A127824 Conjecture: The numbers T(n, 1),...,T(n, k_n) of row n are arranged in non-overlapping clusters of numbers which have the same order of magnitude and whose Collatz trajectories to 1 have the same numbers of ups and downs. The highest cluster of row n is just the number 2^n, the trajectory to 1 of which has n-1 downs and no ups. The second highest cluster of row n consists of the numbers T(n, k_n - r) = 4^(r - 1) * t(n - 2*r + 2) for 1 <= r <= (n - 3) / 2, where t(k) = (2^k - (-1)^k - 3) / 6. These have n-2 downs and one up. The largest and second largest number of this latter cluster are given by A000975 and A153772. - _Markus Sigg_, Sep 25 2020

%F A127824 Suppose S is the list of numbers in row n. Then the list of numbers in row n+1 is the union of each number in S multiplied by 2 and the numbers (x-1)/3, where x is in S, with x=1 (mod 3) and where (x-1)/3 is an odd number greater than 1.
