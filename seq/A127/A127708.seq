%N A127708 Number of non-commutative rings with 1 containing n elements.
%C A127708 We consider rings in which multiplication is associative and has a unit, but where there is at least one pair of non-commuting elements.

%F A127708 a(n) = A037291(n) - A127707(n). - _Bernard Schott_, Apr 19 2022
%e A127708 a(n)=0 for n<=7 and a(8)=1, so all rings (with unit) of cardinality at most 7 are commutative, while the smallest non-commutative ring (with unit) has cardinality 8 and is unique up to isomorphism; it can be represented as the ring of upper-triangular matrices of size 2 over F_2.
%e A127708 A037291(32) = 208, A127707(32) = 109, hence a(32) = 208 - 109 = 99.
