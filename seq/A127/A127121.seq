%N A127121 Number of endofunctions on a set, where the multiset of indegrees forms the n-th partition in Mathematica order (ignoring 0's).
%C A127121 Can be regarded as a triangle with one row for each size of partition.
%e A127121 For n = 3, the 7 endofunctions are (1,2,3) -> (1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,1), (2,1,1), (1,2,3), (1,3,2) and (2,3,1). In the first, node 1 has indegree 3, the next 3 node 1 has indegree 2 and node 2 has indegree 1 (forming partition [2,1]) and the final 3 are permutations, each node having indegree 1. The partitions of 3 in Mathematica order are [3], [2,1], [1^3], so row 3 of the triangle is 1,3,3.
