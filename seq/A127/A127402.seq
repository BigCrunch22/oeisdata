%N A127402 Number of points in a honeycomb net covered by a circular disk of diameter n if the center of the circle is chosen at the deep hole.

%F A127402 a(n) = 2*(A053416(n) - A127403(n)). - _Andrew Howroyd_, Sep 16 2017
%e A127402 a(2)=6 because a disk of diameter 2 covers the 6 net points surrounding the deep hole.
