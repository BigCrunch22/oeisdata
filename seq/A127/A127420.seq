%N A127420 Triangle, read by rows, where row n+1 is generated from row n by first inserting zeros at positions {(m+2)*(m+3)/2, m>=0} in row n and then taking the partial sums in reverse order, for n>=2, starting with 1's in the initial two rows.
%C A127420 Column 0 forms A091352, which also equals column 1 of table A125781, where table A125781 is generated by a complementary recurrence of this triangle. The number of terms in row n is A127419(n).
%e A127420 To generate row 6, start with row 5:
%e A127420 24, 15, 15, 10, 5, 5, 2, 1;
%e A127420 insert zeros at positions [1,4,8,13,..., (m+2)*(m+3)/2 - 2,...]:
%e A127420 24, 0, 15, 15, 0, 10, 5, 5, 0, 2, 1;
%e A127420 then row 6 equals the partial sums of row 5 taken in reverse order:
