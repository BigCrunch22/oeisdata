%N A127731 Triangle read by rows, where row n consists of the r's where r = (n*m)/(n+m) and the m's are positive integers such that (n+m) divides (n*m).
%C A127731 The maximum term of the n-th row, for n >= 2, is (n-1). The minimum term of row n is A063428(n), for n >= 3. Row n contains A063647(n) terms (according to a comment by Benoit Cloitre). For p prime, row p^k has k terms. (Each term in row p^k is of the form p^(k-j)*(p^j -1), 1<=j<=k.)
%e A127731 Row 6 is (2,3,4,5) because row 6 of irregular array A127730 is (3,6,12,30); and (6*3)/(6+3) = 2, (6*6)/(6+6) = 3, (6*12)/(6+12) = 4 and (6*30)/(6+30) = 5.
