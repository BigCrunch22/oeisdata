%N A127614 a(n) = numerator of the continued fraction which has the positive integers which are <= n and are coprime to n as its terms.
%C A127614 The positive integers coprime to n and <= n can be written either from largest to smallest or from smallest to largest and the numerator of the continued fraction would remain unchanged.
%e A127614 The positive integers coprime to 8 and <= 8 are 1,3,5,7. So a(8) is the numerator of 1 +1/(3 +1/(5 +1/7)) = 151/115. a(8) is also the numerator of 7 +1/(5 +1/(3 +1/1)) = 151/21.
