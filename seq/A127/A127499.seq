%N A127499 The number of times that binomial(2n,n) has two prime factors that add to 2n.
%C A127499 In general, a(3n) is much greater than a(3n-1) and a(3n+1), which is apparent in the graph of this sequence.

%e A127499 Consider n=8. Then binomial(16,8)=12870, which has prime factors 2,3,5,11,13. There are two pairs of prime factors that sum to 16: (3,13) and (5,11). Hence a(8)=2.
