%e A127935 a(1) = 3 = A020701(1) is number of meaningful differential operations of the first order on the space R^3, namely {div, grad, curl}.
%e A127935 a(2) = 6 = A090989(2) is number of meaningful differential operations of the 2nd order on the space R^4 (some of them are identically zero though).
%e A127935 a(3) = 16 = A090990(3) is number of meaningful differential operations of the 3rd order on the space R^5.

%E A127935 Corrected from 8th term onwards. It appears the 8th and 9th terms listed were incorrectly taken from A000045 with two numbers concatenated together, whereas the 8th, 9th and 10th terms should have been the 8th term of A090995, the 9th of A129638 and the 10th of A129639. _Joseph Myers_, Dec 23 2008
%E A127935 Name and examples corrected, terms a(11) and beyond added by _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Apr 30 2021
