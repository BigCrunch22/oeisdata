%N A127124 Number of endofunctions whose component sizes form the n-th partition in Mathematica order.
%C A127124 Can be regarded as a triangle with one row for each size of partition.
%e A127124 For n = 3, the 7 endofunctions are (1,2,3) -> (1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,1), (2,1,1), (1,2,3), (1,3,2) and (2,3,1). The components are respectively 123, 123, 13|2, 123, 1|2|3, 1|23 and 123, corresponding to partitions [3], [3], [2,1], [3], [1^3], [2,1] and [3]. The partitions of 3 in Mathematica order are [3], [2,1] and [1^3], so row 3 is 4,2,1.
