%N A127406 Number of points in a 2-dimensional honeycomb net covered by a circular disk of diameter n if the center of the disk is chosen to maximize the number of net points covered by the disk.
%C A127406 a(n)>= max(A127402(n),A127403(n),A127404(n)). a(n) is an upper limit for the number of path segments in A122223.
