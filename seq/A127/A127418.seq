%N A127418 a(1)=1; for n>1, a(n) = the number of earlier terms a(k), 1<k<=n-1, such that (a(k)+n) is coprime to k.
%C A127418 The value of a(1) = 1 is arbitrary. a(1) can be any integer and the rest of the sequence would remain unchanged.
%e A127418 a(1)+11 = 12 is coprime to 1; a(5)+11 = 12 is coprime to 5; and a(8)+11 = 17 is coprime to 8. These 3 are the only cases where (a(k)+11) is coprime to k, for 1 <=k <=10. So a(11) = 3.
