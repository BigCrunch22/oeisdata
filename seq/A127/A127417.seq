%N A127417 a(1)=1; for n > 1, a(n) = number of earlier terms a(k), 1 <= k <= n-1, such that (a(k)+n) is divisible by k.
%C A127417 The value of a(1) = 1 is arbitrary. a(1) can be any integer and the rest of the sequence would remain unchanged.

%e A127417 a(1)+11 = 12 is a multiple of 1; a(2)+11 = 12 is a multiple of 2; and a(7)+11 = 14 is a multiple of 7. These 3 are the only cases where (a(k)+11) is a multiple of k, for 1 <= k <= 10. So a(11) = 3.
