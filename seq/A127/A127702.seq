%N A127702 Least value of x*y giving Max ( sigma(x*y) : 1<=x<=n, 1<=y<=n ).
%C A127702 Value is unique by this definition up to a(103) = 9900.  To go beyond this number, we could define the sequence in terms of "smallest value of x*y" or "largest value of x*y". We choose smallest here.
%e A127702 a(5) = 4 * 5 = 20; sigma(20) = 42
%Y A127702 Cf. A074963, A074964.
