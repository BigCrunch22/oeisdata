%N A127615 a(n) = denominator of the continued fraction which has the positive integers which are <= n and are coprime to n as its terms. The terms are written in order from 1 for the integer part, to n-1 for the final term of the continued fraction.
%e A127615 The positive integers coprime to 8 and <= 8 are 1,3,5,7. So a(8) is the denominator of 1 +1/(3 +1/(5 +1/7)) = 151/115.
