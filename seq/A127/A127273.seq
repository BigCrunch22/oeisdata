%N A127273 Numbers n such that sum of the digits of n and of n+1 divides n + (n+1), n >= 1.
%e A127273 Sum of the digits of 52 and 53 is 7+8 = 15, which divides 52+53 = 105 = 7*15. Hence 52 is a term.
%e A127273 Sum of the digits of 9 and 10 is 9+1 = 10, which does not divide 9+10 = 19. Hence 9 is not in the sequence.
