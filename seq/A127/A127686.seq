%N A127686 Number of non-isomorphic maximal independent sets of the n-cycle graph having no symmetry axis.
%C A127686 Number of non-isomorphic (i.e. defined up to a rotation and a reflection) maximal independent sets of the n-cycle graph having no symmetry axis. Also: Number of cyclic and non-palindromic compositions of n in which each term is either 2 or 3, where a clockwise writing is not distinguished from its counterclockwise counterpart.
