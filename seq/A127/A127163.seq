%N A127163 Integers whose aliquot sequences terminate by encountering the prime 3. Also known as the prime family 3.
%C A127163 This sequence is complete only as far as the last term given, for the eventual fate of the aliquot sequence generated by 276 is not (yet) known

%F A127163 Define s(i)=sigma(i)-i=A000203(i)-i. Then if the aliquot sequence obtained by repeatedly applying the mapping i->s(i) terminates by encountering the prime 3 as a member of its trajectory, i is included in this sequence
%e A127163 a(5)=15 because the fifth integer whose aliquot sequence terminates by encountering the prime 3 as a member of its trajectory is 15. The complete aliquot sequence generated by iterating the proper divisors of 15 is 15->9->4->3->1->0
