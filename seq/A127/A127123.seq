%N A127123 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = number of endofunctions on n points with k points in the image.
%e A127123 For n = 3, the 7 endofunctions are (1,2,3) -> (1,1,1), (1,1,2), (1,2,1), (2,1,1), (1,2,3), (1,3,2) and (2,3,1). The number of points in the image are respectively 1,2,2,2,3,3,3, so row 3 is 1,3,3.
