%N A127535 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of even trees with 2n edges and jump-length equal to k (0<=k<=n-1).
%C A127535 An even tree is an ordered tree in which each vertex has an even outdegree. In the preorder traversal of an ordered tree, any transition from a node at a deeper level to a node on a strictly higher level is called a jump; the positive difference of the levels is called the jump distance; the sum of the jump distances in a given ordered tree is called the jump-length.
%C A127535 The Krandick reference considers jumps and jump-length only in full binary trees.
