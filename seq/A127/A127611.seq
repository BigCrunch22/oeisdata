%N A127611 a(n) = numerator of the continued fraction which has the positive divisors of n as its terms.
%C A127611 The divisors can be written either from largest to smallest or from smallest to largest and the numerator of the continued fraction would remain unchanged.

%F A127611 If p is prime, a(p^k) = p^k * a(p^(k-1)) + a(p^(k-2)), with a(p^0) = a(1) = 1 and a(p^1) = p+1. - _Robert Israel_, Jan 17 2023
%e A127611 The divisors of 6 are 1,2,3,6. So a(6) is the numerator of 1 +1/(2 +1/(3 +1/6)) = 63/44. a(6) is also the numerator of 6 +1/(3 +1/(2+1/1)) = 63/10.
