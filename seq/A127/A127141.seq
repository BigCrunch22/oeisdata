%N A127141 Number of iterations needed before a previous value is reached in the Collatz variation: x_{i+1} = 3x_i+(2n+1) if x_i is odd or x_i/2 if x_i is even, with x_0 = 1.
%e A127141 a(1) = 4 because there are 4 steps to reach a previous value:
%e A127141 step 1: x = 3*1 +(2n+1) = 6
%e A127141 step 2: x = 6/2 = 3;
%e A127141 step 3: x = 3*3 +(2n+1) = 12
%e A127141 step 4: x = 12/2 = 6, which was the result of step 1
%Y A127141 Cf. A127142, A127143.
