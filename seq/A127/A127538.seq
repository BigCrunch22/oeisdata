%N A127538 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of ordered trees with n edges having k odd-length branches starting at the root (0<=k<=n).
%C A127538 Row sums are the Catalan numbers (A000108). T(n,0)=A127539(n). Sum(k*T(n,k),k=0..n)=A127540(n).
%F A127538 G.f.=(1+z)/(1+z-z^2*C-tzC), where C =[1-sqrt(1-4z)]/(2z) is the Catalan function.
%e A127538 T(2,2)=1 because we have the tree /\.
