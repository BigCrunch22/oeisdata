%N A127518 a(n) is the smallest positive integer which does not occur earlier in the sequence and is such that sum{k=1 to n} 1/a(k) has a numerator which is composite (or is 1).
%C A127518 A127519(n)/A127520(n) is sum{k=1 to n} 1/a(k). This sequence, A127518, seems to be a permutation of the positive integers.
%e A127518 1/a(1) + 1/a(2) +1/a(3) = 1 +1/3 + 1/8 = 35/24. 35/24 + 1/2 = 47/24; but 47 is prime, so a(4) is not 2. Likewise, an m of 4,5,6,7 and 9 give a numerator for (35/24 +1/m) which is prime. But 35/24 + 1/10 = 187/120. And since 187 = 11*17 is composite, then a(4) = 10.
