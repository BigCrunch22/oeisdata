%N A127117 A sequence of binary numbers. The first number is 1. Thereafter each number a(n) is defined using the previous number a(n-1) in the following way : a(n)=a(n-1).b(n-1) where the dot means the concatenation operation and b(n-1) stands for the first number that is not present in a(n-1), using the usual order (1, 10, 11, 100, 101, etc.).

%e A127117 a(3)=1011 because a(2)=10 and 0, 1 and 10 are present in a(2) but 11 is not, so we append 11 to a(2) getting 10.11=1011.
