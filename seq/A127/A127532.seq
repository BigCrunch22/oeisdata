%N A127532 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of binary trees with n edges and jump-length equal to k (n >= 0, 0 <= k <= n-2).
%C A127532 In the preorder traversal of a binary tree, any transition from a node at a deeper level to a node on a strictly higher level is called a jump; the positive difference of the levels is called the jump distance; the sum of the jump distances in a given binary tree is called the jump-length.
%C A127532 Rows 0 and 1 have one term each; row n (n >= 2) has n-1 terms.
%C A127532 Row sums are the Catalan numbers (A000108).
%C A127532 T(n,0) = A000129(n+1) (the Pell numbers).
%C A127532 T(n,1) = A074084(n).
%C A127532 Sum_{k>=0} k*T(n,k) = binomial(2n+1, n-3) + binomial(2n, n-3) = A127533(n).
%C A127532 The distribution of the statistic "number of jumps" is given in A127530.
%C A127532 The average jump distance in all binary trees with n edges is 2n(3n+5)(2n-1)/((n+3)(n+4)(3n+1)) (i.e., about 4 levels when n is large). The Krandick reference considers jump-length for full binary trees.
