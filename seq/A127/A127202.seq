%N A127202 a(1)=1, a(2)=2; a(n) = the smallest positive integer not occurring earlier in the sequence such that gcd(a(n), a(n-1)) does not equal gcd(a(n-1), a(n-2)).
%C A127202 This sequence appears to be a permutation of the positive integers. - _Leroy Quet_, Jan 08 2007
%C A127202 From _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 26 2017: (Start)
%C A127202 Theorem: This is a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A127202 Proof: (Outline. For details see the link.)
%C A127202 1. Sequence is infinite.
%C A127202 2. For all m, either m is in the sequence or there exists an n_0 such that for n >= n_0, a(n) > m.
%C A127202 3. For all primes p, there is a term divisible by p.
%C A127202 4. For all primes p, there are infinitely many multiples of p in the sequence.
%C A127202 5. Every prime appears in the sequence.
%C A127202 6. For any number m, there are infinitely many multiples of m in the sequence.
%C A127202 7. Every number m appears in the sequence.

%C A127202 Comment from _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 28 2017: (Start)
%C A127202 There are several short cycles and at least one apparently infinite orbit:
%C A127202 [1], [2], [3, 4], [5, 6], [7, 10, 8],
%C A127202 [9, 14, 22, 19, 16, 26, 24, 20, 17, 15, 13, 11],
%C A127202 [21, 34, 29, 25],
%C A127202 and the first apparently infinite orbit is, in the forward direction,
%C A127202 [23, 38, 33, 32, 28, 46, 41, 40, 35, 58, 51, 45, 42, 37, 62, 106, ...] (see A282712), and in the reverse direction
%C A127202 [23, 27, 31, 36, 39, 44, 50, 57, 65, 73, 82, 47, 53, 61, 68, 77, ...] (see A282713). (End)
%C A127202 Conjecture: The two lines in the graph are (apart from small local deviations) defined by the same equations as the two lines in the graph of A283312. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 12 2017

%e A127202 gcd(a(7), a(8)) = gcd(10,7) = 1. So a(9) is the smallest positive integer which does not occur earlier in the sequence and which is such that gcd(a(9), 7) is not 1. So a(9) = 14, since gcd(14,7) = 7.
