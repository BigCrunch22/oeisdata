%N A127175 Primes whose "Look And Say" descriptions from left to right (in the sense of method B, i.e., digit-indication followed by frequency) are also primes.
%e A127175 41, 337, 809, 1123, for instance, are in the sequence because their respective descriptions 4111 (4 once, 1 once), 3271 (3 twice, 7 once), 810191 (8 once, 0 once, 9 once), 122131 (1 twice, 2 once, 3 once) are also primes.
