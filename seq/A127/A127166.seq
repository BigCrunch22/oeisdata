%N A127166 a(n) = the minimum prime S possible, if S = product of b(k)'s + product of c(k)'s, where the distinct positive integers <= n are partitioned into the two sets {b(k)} and {c(k)}. a(n) = 0 if no prime S exists for that n.
%C A127166 a(0)=a(1)=2 because the product over the empty set is defined here as 1. For S to be a prime, the positive integers <= n, except 1 and the primes > n/2, must all be together in either {b(k)} or {c(k)}. If p is a prime where n/2 < p <= n, then it is possible that p is in either product of the S sum, as can 1. Terms calculated by _W. Edwin Clark_.

%e A127166 For n = 6 we have the only prime S (and so the minimum prime S) with S = 1*2*3*4*6 + 5 = 149.
