%N A127404 Number of points in a honeycomb net covered by a circular disk of diameter n if the center of the circle is chosen at mid-edge between two grid points.
%e A127404 a(1)=2 because a disk of diameter 1 centered at the middle of an edge covers the 2 net points bounding this edge.
%Y A127404 Cf. A127402, A127403, A127405, A127406. The corresponding sequences for the square lattice and hexagonal lattice are A053414 and A053417, respectively.
