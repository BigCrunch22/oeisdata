%N A127483 Numbers n such that A100705(n) = n^3 + (n+1)^2 is prime.
%C A127483 Corresponding primes of the form n^3 + (n+1)^2 are listed in A100662(n) = {5, 17, 43, 89, 593, 829, 2393, 2969, 3631, 5237, ...}.
%C A127483 Note that there are many consecutive twins, triples and quadruplets in a(n). For example: (1,2,3,4), {8,9}, {13,14,15}, {22,23,24,25}, {34,35}, {38,39}, {64,65}, {98,99,100}.
%C A127483 Twins start with n = {1,2,3,8,13,14,22,23,24,34,38,64,98,99,,...} = A127484, or numbers n such that a(n) = a(n+1) - 1.
%C A127483 Triplets start with n = {1,2,13,22,23,98,253,343,573,638,702,...} = A127485, or numbers n such that a(n) = a(n+1) - 1 = a(n+2) - 2.
%C A127483 Quadruplets start with n = {1,22,13077,14267,16092,16267,162,...} = A127486.
