%N A084336 a(n) is the smallest composite number not already in the sequence such that the absolute values of the successive differences are distinct primes.
%C A084336 The absolute values of the successive difference are 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 11, 19, 43, 23, 29, 37, 31, ...
%C A084336 Does every composite number occur in the sequence? Does every prime occur as a difference?
