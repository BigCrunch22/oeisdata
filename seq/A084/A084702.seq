%N A084702 a(n) is the smallest k such that k + 1 and n*k + 1 both are perfect squares, or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A084702 a(4) = 0 as when k+1 is a square, 4k+4 is also a square; hence 4k+1 cannot be a square for k > 0.

%F A084702 a(i^2-1) is usually (i-1)^2-1. For 2 < i < 1000 there are 34 exceptions. The first four of these are a(11^2-1) = 3, a(23^2-1) = 8, a(39^2-1) = 15 and a(41^2-1) = 3. - _David Wasserman_, May 03 2007
%e A084702 a(5) = 3 as 3 + 1 = 4 and 3*5 + 1 = 16 both are squares.
