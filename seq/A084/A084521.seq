%N A084521 An infinite juggling sequence of three balls: successively larger 'prime' ground-state 3-ball site swaps listed in lexicographical order. A subset of A084511.
%C A084521 A juggling sequence is defined as 'prime', if it does not visit any state more than once. This means that in A084523 no integer occurs twice between consecutive sevens.

%e A084521 The successive site swaps are: 3; 4,2; 4,4,1; 5,2,2; 5,3,1; 4,4,4,0; 4,5,3,0; ... See A084522.
%Y A084521 The number of such site swaps of length n is given by A084529. First position where n appears: A084527.
