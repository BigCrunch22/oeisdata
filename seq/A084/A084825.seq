%I A084825 #9 Jan 03 2016 04:36:39
%S A084825 1,8,27,66
%N A084825 Maximum number of spheres of diameter one that can be packed in a cube of edge length n.
%C A084825 The next term a(4) is at least 64. From an extrapolation of Dave Boll's numerical results a(4)~=66 and a(5)~=141 are estimated values for the next terms.
%H A084825 Dave Boll, <a href="https://home.comcast.net/~davejanelle/packing.html">Optimal Packing of Circles and Spheres</a>
%H A084825 Hugo Pfoertner, <a href="http://www.randomwalk.de/sphere/incube/index.htm">Densest Packings of Equal Spheres in a Cube</a>
%e A084825 a(3)=27 because there is no known better arrangement than the 3*3*3 cubic one that would allow packing more than 27 spheres into a cube of edge length 3.
%Y A084825 Cf. A084824, A084828, A084617.
