%N A084278 Squarefree numbers n which are the product of an even number of distinct primes such that Fibonacci(n) is also squarefree and the product of an even number of distinct primes.
%C A084278 The Pocklington-Lehmer "P-1"primality test, as implemented in PARI 2.1.3, was used separately for factors > 10^8 encountered in the computation.
%e A084278 34 is in the sequence since Fibonacci(34) = 5702887, 34 = 2*17, 5702887 = 1597*3571; 55 is in the sequence since Fibonacci(55) = 139583862445, 55 = 5*11, 139583862445 = 5*89*661*474541.
