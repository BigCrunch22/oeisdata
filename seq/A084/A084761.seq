%N A084761 A sequence of primes such that {a(n)-a(n-1)}/{a(n-1)-a(n-2)} is a unique integer.
%C A084761 The sequence of successive difference ratios {a(n)-a(n-1)}/{a(n-1)-a(n-2)} is 2,1,3,4,5,6,8,7,... Conjecture:(1) every number is a term of this sequence, or for every number r there exists some k such that {a(k) - a(k-1)}/{a(k-1)-a(k-2)} = r. Question: What is the longest string of consecutive integers in this sequence (of successive differences)?
%e A084761 {a(5)-a(4)}/{a(4)-a(3)} = (13-7)/(7-5) = 3. Then it is to be taken care of that this ratio is not 3 for any other set of three successive terms.
