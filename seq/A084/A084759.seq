%N A084759 Composite numbers in ascending order such that the difference of successive terms is unique. a(m) - a(m-1) = a(k) - a(k-1) iff m = k.
%C A084759 The sequence of first differences is 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 10, 12, 13, 15, 14, 16, 18, 17, 19, 20, 21, 23, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, ... Conjecture: every number is a term of this sequence. For every number r there exists some k such that a(k) - a(k-1) = r.
%e A084759 The term after 14 is 20 and not 18 or 16 as 6-4 = 16-14 = 2, 18-14 = 14-10 = 4.
