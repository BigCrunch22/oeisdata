%N A084160 First occurrence prime gaps of the primes in sequence A002313 (Real primes with corresponding complex primes). a(0) = 2 with length of gap 3. For n>0 the size of the gap in the sequence is 4n, a(n) is the starting prime of the gap.
%C A084160 Real primes 2,5,13,17,29,37,... have a unique representation as sum of two squares. Values larger 2 are the primes p with p = 1 mod 4. This is sequence A002313. If p = x^2 + y^2, the corresponding complex prime is x+y*i
