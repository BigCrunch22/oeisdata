%N A084375 Indices of primes which remain prime if any one digit is deleted (leading zeros allowed).
%C A084375 Primes of this kind (with and without leading zeros) are in A051362 and A034302. Here more terms are given and question is asked: is this sequence finite? From first 1,000,000 primes only 77 are of this kind.
%e A084375 The 41st prime is 179, and 17, 19, and 79 are all primes, so 41 is in the sequence. - _Harvey P. Dale_, Jun 20 2011
