%N A084296 Triangle: number of distinct prime factors in n-th primorial numbers when n prime factors first appears and in n-1 subsequent integers after.
%C A084296 Omega-values(=A001221) in the subsequent neighborhood of radius n, for primorial numbers are usually neither all distinct or all equal items as it is required in A068069, A045983 sequences.
%e A084296 n-th row of table consists of n numbers A001221[A002110(n+j)], j=0...n-1:
