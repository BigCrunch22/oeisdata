%N A084929 If the numbers 1 to n^3 are arranged in a cubic array, a(n) is the minimum number of primes in each column of the n^2 columns in the "north-south view" that can have primes.
%C A084929 The first column is (1,4,7), the second is (2,5,8), etc. Only columns whose tops are relatively prime to n are counted. In this case, columns starting with 3, 12 and 21 cannot have primes. a(n) = 0 for n = 1, 9, 25, 27, 35, 49 and the primes from 5 to 71, except 59. It appears that a(n) > 0 for n > 109. This has been confirmed up to n = 1000.
%D A084929 See A083382 for references and links to the two-dimensional case.
