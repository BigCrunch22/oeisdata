%N A084392 For k not divisible by 10, let f(k) be the number obtained by moving the last digit of k to the front. Then a(n) is the smallest k > 0, made of nonzero digits, such that for all 1 <= i < n, i+1 divides f^i(k).
%e A084392 a(5) = 2145 because 2 divides 5214, 3 divides 4521, 4 divides 1452 and 5 divides 2145.
