%N A084511 An infinite juggling sequence of three balls: successively larger indecomposable ground-state 3-ball site swaps listed in lexicographical order. A subset of A084501.
%C A084511 By "indecomposable" we mean that the juggling state sequence associated to each loop should not return to the ground state 7 (xxx) until after the last throw. I.e., this means that A084515 gives positions of ALL the 7s (ground states) in A084513.
%C A084511 One can take any subsequence A084511[A084515(i)+1..A084515(j)] (j>i) and try to juggle it periodically or give it to one of the Siteswap animators available at J.I.S., e.g., by taking the terms 4-12, one gets a site swap pattern "441522531".
