%N A084597 Largest k such that there are exactly n primes between k^2 and (k+1)^2.
%C A084597 a(n) is the index of last occurrence of n in A014085. This sequence relies on a heuristic calculation and there is no proof that it is correct. Conjecture: There is no k that has only one prime between k^2 and (k+1)^2.
