%N A084385 a(1) = 1; a(n+1) is the smallest number not occurring earlier and coprime to Sum_{j=1..n} a(j).
%C A084385 Rearrangement of the positive integers.
%C A084385 Any sequence defined in this manner (that is, a(1) is any positive integer and a(n+1) is the smallest integer not occurring earlier and coprime to Sum_{j=1..n} a(j)) is a rearrangement of all positive integers.  This property is used by problem 4 of Chinese High School Mathematical Olympiad in 2018. - _Shu Shang_, Sep 29 2021
