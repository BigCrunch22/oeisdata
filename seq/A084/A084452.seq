%N A084452 An infinite juggling sequence with three balls: a(n) is zero when A084451(n-1) is even, otherwise the least (lowest) throw such that the resulting next juggling state A084451(n) does not occur in A084451[0..n-1].
%C A084452 Note that after the zero-throws the resulting next juggling state might be one encountered before. See A084458 for variant in which this does not happen.
