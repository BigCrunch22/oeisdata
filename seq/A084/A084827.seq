%N A084827 Maximum number of spheres of volume one that can be packed in a sphere of volume n.
%C A084827 Higher terms of the sequence are only conjectures derived from numerical results. The first 12 arrangements are identical with the solutions of the Tammes problem (see A080865).

%e A084827 a(10)=2 because a sphere of volume 10 is slightly too small to cover 3 mutually touching spheres of volume 1. a(27)=13 because the arrangement of 12 spheres plus one central sphere needs exactly a sphere with R=3*r to be contained.
