%C A084912 Puzzle: a man offered to sell me a car two years ago for $1024; a year later his price was $640; a little while after that he asked $400; and last week he was willing to sell for $250. The next time he reduces I shall buy. At what price will I buy the car if he makes consistent reductions?
%C A084912 Answer: a(5) = 1250/8 = $156.25 (not an integer).
