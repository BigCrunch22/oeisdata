%N A084142 There are a unique number of primes between a(n) and 2a(n). This is a list of all such integers > zero in numerical order.
%C A084142 The number of primes between a(n) and 2a(n) is unique because no other number m has the same of primes between m and 2m, exclusively, for m>0. a(n) is the value of A060756 or A084139 when A084138 is one. Question: Is this sequence infinitely long?
