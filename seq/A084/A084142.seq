%N A084142 Positive numbers k such that the number of primes between k and 2*k is different from the number of primes between m and 2*m for every number m != k.
%C A084142 The number of primes between k and 2*k is unique because no other number m > 0 has the same of primes between m and 2m, exclusively. k is the value of A060756(j) or A084139(j) when A084138(j) = 1. Question: Is this sequence infinitely long?
%C A084142 If k > 1 is a term then A060715(k-1) < A060715(k) < A060715(k+1). Consequently, (2*k-1, 2*k+1) is a twin prime pair, so 3|k. Additionally, it can be shown that k-1..k+3 are all composite numbers. Moreover, if k is even, then k-4..k+4 are all composite numbers. - _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Oct 08 2023
