%N A084141 a(n) is the index in sequence A084138 when the value of that sequence is one (1), i.e., there is exactly one case where there are exactly a(n) primes between m and 2m, exclusively, for m > 0.
%C A084141 This calculation relies on the fact that Pi(2*m) - Pi(m) > m/(3*log(m)) for m >= 5. Conjecture: There are an infinite number of terms in this sequence.

%e A084141 a(3)=47 because the 3rd one in sequence A084138 is its item 47. There is exactly one case where there are exactly 47 primes between m and 2m.
