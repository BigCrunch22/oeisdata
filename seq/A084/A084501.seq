%N A084501 An infinite juggling sequence of three balls: successively larger ground-state 3-ball site swaps listed in lexicographic order.
%C A084501 Every possible 3-ball asynchronic site swap of finite period occurs as a subsequence of this sequence. E.g., "51" (three-ball shower) occurs first time at a(65)=5, a(66)=1.
%C A084501 We obtain the sequence by traversing each possible loop of successively larger lengths in 3-ball state graph as depicted in Polster's book, or section 7 of Knutson's Siteswap FAQ (but not limited by throw height), starting from and ending to the ground state 7 (xxx) and by concatenating those sequences in lexicographic order.
%C A084501 One can take any subsequence A084501[i..j] such that A084503(i-1) = A084503(j) = 7 and try to juggle it periodically or give it to one of the Siteswap animators available at J.I.S., e.g., by taking the first 39 terms, one gets a site swap pattern "333423333424234415225313333334234233441".
