%N A084758 The slowest increasing sequence of primes such that difference of successive terms is unique.
%C A084758 The sequence of successive differences is 1,2,6,8,4,14,10,12,20,18,16,... Conjecture: every even number is a term of this sequence. For every even number e there exists some k such that a(k) - a(k-1) = e.
