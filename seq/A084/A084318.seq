%N A084318 Iterate function described in A084317 if started at initial value n until reaching a fixed point.
%C A084318 Conjecture: fixed point always exists.
%C A084318 Some initial values capriciously provide very large prime fixed-points. This behavior is illustrated in A084319 for initial value n=91.
%C A084318 Unlike the related home primes A037274, the trajectory of numbers in this procedure is not strictly increasing. Of the 8770 numbers < 10000 that have trajectories (that is, that are neither 1 nor prime) 3727 decrease at least once before reaching 30 digits. A sequence with no decreases is twice as likely to not terminate before 30 digits (10.0%) as one that has at least one decrease (4.8%). - _Christian N. K. Anderson_, May 04 2013
%H A084318 Christian N. K. Anderson, <a href="/A084318/a084318_1.txt">Table of n, steps to reach a(n), and a(n)</a> for numbers where a(n) has fewer than 30 digits; NA otherwise. Also includes trajectories, factors separated by |s.
%e A084318 a(0)=0 since no prime factors to concatenate;
%e A084318 a[p^j]=p for p prime(powers);
%e A084318 n=95=519: fixed-point list is {95,519,3173,19167,36389},
%e A084318 so a(95)=36389, a prime.
