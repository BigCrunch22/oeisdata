%N A084644 Best packings of m>1 equal circles into a larger circle setting a new density record.
%C A084644 Sequence terms for n>5 are only conjectures. The arrangement of 37 circles consists of one central circle surrounded by 3 rings of 6,12 and 18 circles. For n=7, 49 of the 55 circles are arranged in a rigid hexagonal lattice with 6 "rattlers" inserted in gaps at the circumference.
