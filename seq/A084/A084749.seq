%C A084749 Contribution from _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Oct 21 2009: (Start)
%C A084749 Numbers corresponding to a(19)-a(24) are probable primes.
%C A084749 There is no further term up to 8300. (End)
%e A084749 727 = 6! + 7 is a prime but 8! +11 is composite hence 6 is a member but 8 is not.
%e A084749 7 is in the sequence because 7!=5040,NextPrime[7]=11 and 5040+11 is prime.
