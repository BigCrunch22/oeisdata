%N A084531 Signature sequence of phi = (1+sqrt(5))/2 = 1.61803...
%C A084531 Arrange the numbers i+j*x (i,j >= 1) in increasing order; the sequence of i's is the signature of x; the sequence of j's is the signature of 1/x.
%C A084531 As a fractal sequence, if the first occurrence of each n is deleted, the remaining sequence is the original. That is, the upper trim of A084531 is A084531. Also, the lower trim of A084531 is A084531, meaning that if 1 is subtracted from every term and then all 0's are deleted, the result is the original sequence. Every fractal sequence begets an interspersion; the interspersion of A084531 is A167267. - _Clark Kimberling_, Oct 31 2009
%C A084531 The positions of the first occurrence of i in this sequence, i>=1, form sequence A255977.  That is, 1 occurs for the first time at position 1, 2 at position 2, 3 at position 4, 4 at position 6, and 1,2,4,6, ... is A255977. - _Jeffrey Shallit_, Jun 28 2024
