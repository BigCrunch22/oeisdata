%N A084163 Primes which are -1 mod m, where m is the index of the prime in sequence A002313 (Real primes with corresponding complex primes). The index m can be found in A084164 Primes which are 1 mod m can be found in sequence A084165.
%C A084163 Real primes 2,5,13,17,29,37,... have a unique representation as sum of two squares. Values larger 2 are the primes p with p = 1 mod 4. This is sequence A002313. If p = x^2 + y^2, the corresponding complex prime is x+y*i. First complex prime is 1+i with 2 as corresponding real prime, according to reference, page 1-2.
%D A084163 Handbook of First Complex Prime Numbers, Part1+2 Ervand Kogbetliantz and Alice Krikorian, Gordon and Breach, 1971. The list in Part 2 contains an error: on page 919, column 2, number 5 is printed twice, so the indices after that number are wrong.
%e A084163 197 is the 22nd prime in sequence A002313, 22*9 = 198, so 197 = -1 mod 22.
