%N A084712 Smallest prime of the form (2n)^k + 1, or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A084712 It has not been proved that a(19), a(25), a(31), a(34), a(43) and a(46) are 0; if these values do exist, they have > 4000 digits. The other zeros are definite. - _David Wasserman_, Jan 03 2005
%C A084712 a((p-1)/2) = p for primes p > 2, or a(n) = 2n+1 for n = (p-1)/2. All other positive a(n) belong to A002496 = primes of form m^2 + 1. Corresponding positive exponents k are powers of 2. They are listed in A079706. - _Alexander Adamchuk_, Sep 17 2006
%C A084712 Because k must be a power of 2, numbers of the form (2n)^k+1 are called generalized Fermat numbers with base 2n. These numbers, like the regular Fermat numbers, are seldom prime. I checked n=19, 25, 31, 34, 43, 46 with k up to 2^16 without finding any primes. - _T. D. Noe_, May 13 2008
%C A084712 Comments from _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 27 2024: (Start)
%C A084712 As pointed out by _Max Alekseyev_, the previous version violated the OEIS rules, since a(19) has not been confirmed. I therefore removed the terms starting at a(19).
