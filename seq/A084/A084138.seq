%N A084138 a(n) is the number of times n is in sequence A060715, i.e., there are exactly a(n) cases where there are exactly n primes between m and 2m, exclusively, for m > 0.
%C A084138 This calculation relies on the fact that Pi(2*m) - Pi(m) > m/(3*log(m)) for m >= 5. It can be shown that a(n) is never zero, i.e., every nonnegative integer is in sequence A060715.

%e A084138 a(22)=1 because there are 22 primes between 120 and 240 (namely, prime numbers p(31)=127 through p(52)=239), and in no other case are there exactly 22 primes between m and 2m exclusively.
