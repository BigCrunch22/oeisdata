%N A151613 Consider a permutation K = (k(1),k(2),...,k(A000005(n))) of the positive divisors of n. Consider the partial sums S = Sum_{j=1..m} k(j), 1 <= m <= A000005(n). Then a(n) is the maximum number, for any permutation K, of partial sums S that are coprime to n.

%F A151613 a(p) = 2 for prime p.
%F A151613 a(2^k) = k+1.
%F A151613 If n is even, then a(n) <= A000005(n) - floor(A001227(n)/2). (End)
%e A151613 The divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. The sum of all these is 28, which is not coprime to 12. So possibly the largest number of partial sums that are coprime to 12 is 5 (but it definitely is not 6). Indeed, if the permutation K is, for example, (1,4,2,6,12,3), then the partial sums are: 1=1, 1+4=5, 1+4+2=7, 1+4+2+6=13, 1+4+2+6+12=25, and 1+4+2+6+12+3=28. Five of these sums (1,5,7,13,25) are coprime to 12, proving that the maximum number of partial sums coprime to 12 = a(12) = 5.
