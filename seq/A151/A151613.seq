%N A151613 Consider a permutation K = (k(1),k(2),...,k(A000005(n))) of the positive divisors of n. Consider the partial sums S = Sum_{j=1..m} k(j), 1 <= m <= A000005(n). Then a(n) is the maximum number, for any permutation K, of partial sums S that are coprime to n.

%F A151613 a(p) = 2 for prime p.
%F A151613 a(2^k) = k+1.
%F A151613 If n is even, then a(n) <= A000005(n) - floor(A001227(n)/2). (End)
%e A151613 The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12. The sum of all these is 28, which is not coprime to 12. So possibly the largest number of partial sums that are coprime to 12 is 5 (but it definitely is not 6). Indeed, if the permutation K is, for example, (1,4,2,6,12,3), then the partial sums are: 1 = 1, 1+4 = 5, 1+4+2 = 7, 1+4+2+6 = 13, 1+4+2+6+12 = 25, and 1+4+2+6+12+3 = 28. Five of these sums (1,5,7,13,25) are coprime to 12, proving that the maximum number of partial sums coprime to 12 = a(12) = 5.
