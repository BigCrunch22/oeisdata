%N A151525 Number of poly-IH64-tiles (holes allowed) with n cells.
%C A151525 Equivalently, polyominoes where two polyominoes are considered the same if and only if they are related by a translation or a reflection in a horizontal line.  Formerly described as one-sided polyrects, but that is A151522.
