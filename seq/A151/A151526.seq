%N A151526 Number of strip poly-IH64-tiles (holes allowed) with n cells.
%C A151526 Equivalently, strip polyominoes where two polyominoes are considered the same if and only if they are related by a translation or a reflection in a horizontal line.  Formerly described as one-sided strip polyrects, but that is A151523.
