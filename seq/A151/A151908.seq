%N A151908 Number of nonisomorphic cube tilings of dimension n which can be constructed using the recipe presented at the beginning of Section 3 of the Lagarias-Shor paper.
%C A151908 A weak lower bound for a(8) is 404.
%C A151908 It appears that there is exactly one trivial tiling in each dimension. If so, and this tiling is excluded, we get a sequence which potentially matches two existing sequences in the OEIS.
