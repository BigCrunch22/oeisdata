%N A151959 Consider the Kaprekar map x->K(x) described in A151949. Sequence gives the smallest number that belongs to a cycle of length n under repeated iteration of this map, or -1 if there is no cycle of length n.
%C A151959 No cycle of length 6 is presently known!
%C A151959 It is also known that a(7) = 420876, a(8) = 7509843, a(14) = 753098643.
%C A151959 From _Joseph Myers_, Aug 19 2009: (Start)
%C A151959 One does not need to consider every integer of n digits, only the sorted sequences of n digits (of which there are binomial(n+9, 9), so 28048800 for 23 digits). Then you only need to consider those sorted sequences of digits whose total is a multiple of 9, as the number and so the sum of its digits is always a multiple of 9 after the first iteration, which reduces the work by a further factor of about 9.
%C A151959 As a further refinement, the result of a single subtraction, if not zero, will have digit sequence of the form
%C A151959 d_1 d_2 ... d_k-1 9...9 9-d_k ... 9-d_2 9-d_1+1
%C A151959 where the values d_i are in the range 1 to 9 and the sequence of 9's in the middle may be empty.
%C A151959 From this form it follows that for any member of a cycle,
%C A151959 abs(number of 8's - number of 1's) + abs(number of 7's - number of 2's) +
%C A151959 abs(number of 6's - number of 3's) + abs(number of 5's - number of 4's) +
%C A151959 max(0, number of 0's - number of 9's) <= 4,
%C A151959 so given the numbers of 0's, 1's, 2's, 3's and 4's there is little freedom left in choosing the number of each remaining digit.
%C A151959 No further cycle lengths exist up to at least 140 digits. The only 4-cycles up to there are the ones containing 61974 and 62964, the only 8-cycles up to there are the ones containing 7509843 and 76320987633, the only 14-cycle up to there is the one containing 753098643. All the 7-cycles so far follow the pattern
%C A151959 7-cycle: 420876
%C A151959 7-cycle: 43208766
%C A151959 7-cycle: 4332087666
%C A151959 7-cycle: 433320876666
%C A151959 7-cycle: 43333208766666
%C A151959 7-cycle: 4333332087666666 ... (End)

%A A151959 _Klaus Brockhaus_ and _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 19 2009
%E A151959 The term a(3) = 64308654 was initially only a conjecture, but was confirmed by _Zak Seidov_, Aug 19 2009
%E A151959 a(4) = 61974 corrected by _R. J. Mathar_, Aug 19 2009 (we had not given the smallest member of the 4-cycle).
%E A151959 a(4) = 61974, a(7) = 420876, and a(8) = 7509843 confirmed by _Zak Seidov_, Aug 19 2009 (formerly the a(8) value was just an upper bound)
%E A151959 a(5) = 86420987532 and a(14) = 753098643 from _Joseph Myers_, Aug 19 2009. He also confirms the other values, and remarks that there are no other cycle lengths up to at least 140 digits.
