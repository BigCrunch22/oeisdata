%N A151900 Singular indices in A139206.
%C A151900 Definition: Singular indices in A139206 are numbers n for which there exists no prime p such that p!/n-1 is prime or, if such a prime p exists, it is very big.
%C A151900 I frown upon this "definition" and the notion of "very big", especially because A139206(24)=3361 seems to be considered to be "very big"(?!)... A more rigorous definition should be given. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 03 2013
