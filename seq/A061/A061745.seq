%C A061745 From _Alonso del Arte_, Oct 20 2019: (Start)
%C A061745 The characters indexed by these code points are more like words than digits, sort of like the difference between the word "three" and the character "3".
%C A061745 With one exception, all of these characters come from the CJK Unified Ideographs block, into which they are sorted according to stroke count or stroke count of the primary radical rather than the numerical value of the number word.
%C A061745 Only the zero character has an associated numeric value that can be accessed through Java's Character.getNumericValue() function. The rest return -1 to indicate "the character does not have a numeric value." (End)
