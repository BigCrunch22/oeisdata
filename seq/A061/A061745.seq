%C A061745 From _Alonso del Arte_, Oct 20 2019: (Start)
%C A061745 The characters indexed by these code points are more like words than digits, sort of like the difference between the word "three" and the character "3".
%C A061745 With one exception, all of these characters come from the CJK Unified Ideographs block, into which they are sorted according to stroke count or stroke count of the primary radical rather than the numerical value of the number word.
%C A061745 Only the zero character has an associated numeric value that can be accessed through Java's Character.getNumericValue() function. The rest return -1 to indicate "the character does not have a numeric value." (End)

%e A061745 The very first character of the CJK Unified Ideographs block is U+4E00 (19968), often used to mean "one," but it can also be used to mean "alone." This is followed by U+4E01, a character sometimes used to mean "male adult" and a character sometimes used to mean "obstruction of breath" (U+4E02).
%e A061745 Next is U+4E03 (19971), which is always used to mean "seven" (though in combination with other characters it may mean a multiple of 7 or a number congruent to 7 mod 10).
