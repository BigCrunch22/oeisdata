%N A061310 Numbers which cannot be reached in the Countdown Numbers Game starting from (1,2,3,4,5,6): the game allows brackets and the operations + - x and / and not all numbers need be used, while the result of each partial calculation must be an integer.
%C A061310 Starting with (1,1,1,1,1,1) no number greater than 9 can be reached.
%C A061310 Every number greater than 1080 = 6*5*4*3*(2+1) is in the sequence. - _Sean A. Irvine_, Feb 07 2023

%e A061310 283 is not in the sequence since 283=((6+1)*5*4*2)+3; 285 is not in the sequence since 285=((6*5*2)-3)*(4+1). However there is no similar calculation for 284 so 284 is in the sequence.
