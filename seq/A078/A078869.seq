%N A078869 Number of n-tuples with elements in {2,4,6} which can occur as the differences between n+1 consecutive primes > n+1. (Values of a(11), ..., a(18) are conjectured to be correct, but are only known to be upper bounds.)
%C A078869 The ">n+1" rules out n-tuples like (2,2), which only occurs for the primes 3, 5, 7. All terms from a(19) on equal 0.
%C A078869 An n-tuple (a_1,a_2,...,a_n) is counted iff the partial sums 0, a_1, a_1+a_2, ..., a_1+...+a_n do not contain a complete residue system (mod p) for any prime p.
