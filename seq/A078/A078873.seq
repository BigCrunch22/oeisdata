%N A078873 Sorted version of A078872.
%C A078873 Each term is the smallest prime p >= 7 such that the differences between the 6 consecutive primes starting with p are (d1,d2,d3,d4,d5), for some quintuple (d1,d2,d3,d4,d5) with elements in {2,4,6}.
%e A078873 The term 90001 corresponds to the quadruple (6,4,6,2,4): 90001, 90007, 90011, 90017, 90019, 90023 are consecutive primes.
%Y A078873 The quintuples are in A078870. The same primes, in lexicographic order of the quintuples, are in A078872. The analogous sequences for quadruples and 6-tuples are in A078867 and A078875. Cf. A001223.
