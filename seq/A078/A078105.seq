%N A078105 Number of nonisomorphic ways a loop can cross three roads meeting in a Y n times (orbits under symmetry group of order 6).
%C A078105 There is no constraint on touching any particular sector.
%C A078105 The Mercedes-Benz problem: closed meanders crossing a Y.
%H A078105 Anonymous, <a href="/A078105/a078105.a.gif">Illustration for a(3) = 1</a>
%e A078105 With three crossings the loop must cut each road exactly once, so a(3) = 1.
%e A078105 With 4 crossings the loop can cut one road 4 times (one possibility), or two roads twice each (one possibility), so a(4) = 2.
%Y A078105 Cf. A078104 (total number of solutions), A077460 and A005315 (loop crossing one road).
