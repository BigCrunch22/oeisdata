%N A078874 The 6-tuples (d1,d2,d3,d4,d5,d6) with elements in {2,4,6} are listed in lexicographic order; for each 6-tuple, this sequence lists the smallest prime p >= 7 such that the differences between the 7 consecutive primes starting with p are (d1,d2,d3,d4,d5,d6), if such a prime exists.
%C A078874 The 48 6-tuples for which p exists are listed, in decimal form, in A078871.
%e A078874 The term 151 corresponds to the 6-tuple (6,6,4,6,6,2): 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181 are consecutive primes.
%Y A078874 The 6-tuples are in A078871. The same primes, in increasing order, are in A078875. The analogous sequences for quadruples and quintuples are in A078866 and A078872. Cf. A001223.
