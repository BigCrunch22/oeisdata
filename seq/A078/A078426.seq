%N A078426 Numbers k such that there is no solution to the equation sigma(x) = 2^k, where sigma(x) denotes the sum of the divisors of x.
%C A078426 Numbers that are not a sum of distinct Mersenne exponents (A000043). - _Vladeta Jovovic_, Jan 01 2003
%C A078426 Because there is a large gap between the 31st and 32nd Mersenne exponents, all k between 704338 and 756839 are in this sequence. - _T. D. Noe_, Oct 12 2006
%C A078426 A000203(A180162(a(n))) = 6^a(n), for n > 1. - _Walter Kehowski_, Aug 16 2010
%C A078426 Using all known Mersenne exponents, there are exactly 52935 terms in this sequence. When a new Mersenne prime (with exponent q) is found, there will be no new terms if the sum of the previous Mersenne exponents (A109472) is greater than q - 22.
