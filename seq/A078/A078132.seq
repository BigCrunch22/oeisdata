%N A078132 Primes which can be written as sum of cubes > 1.
%C A078132 Equivalent to primes which can be written as the sum of cubes of primes; the question being "what is the minimum number of terms in such sums when they can be written in more than one way? - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Sep 21 2006
%C A078132 Mikawa and Peneva: "One of the famous and still unsettled problems in additive prime number theory is the conjecture that every sufficiently large integer satisfying some natural congruence conditions, can be written as the sum of four cubes of primes. Although the present methods lack the power to prove such a strong result, Hua... has been able to prove that every sufficiently large odd integer as the sum of nine cubes of primes. He also established that almost all integers {n == 1 mod 2, n =/= 0, +/-2 mod 9, n =/= 0 mod 7} can be expressed as the sum of five cubes of primes." - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Sep 21 2006
