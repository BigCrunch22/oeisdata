%N A078941 Flipping burnt pancakes. Maximum number of spatula flips to sort a stack of n pancakes of different sizes, each burnt on one side, so that the smallest ends up on top, ..., the largest at the bottom and each has its burnt side down.
%C A078941 In a 'spatula flip', a spatula is inserted below any pancake and all pancakes above the spatula are lifted and replaced in reverse order.
%C A078941 It is conjectured that the initial configuration in which the pancakes are in the correct order but all of the burnt sides are up is a worst case for the problem. If so, then this sequence is identical to A078942.
