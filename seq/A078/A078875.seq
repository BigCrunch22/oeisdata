%N A078875 Sorted version of A078874.
%C A078875 Each term is the smallest prime p >= 7 such that the differences between the 7 consecutive primes starting with p are (d1,d2,d3,d4,d5,d6), for some 6-tuple (d1,d2,d3,d4,d5,d6) with elements in {2,4,6}.
%e A078875 The term 151 corresponds to the 6-tuple (6,6,4,6,6,2): 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181 are consecutive primes.
%Y A078875 The 6-tuples are in A078871. The same primes, in lexicographic order of the 6-tuples, are in A078874. The analogous sequences for quadruples and quintuples are in A078867 and A078873. Cf. A001223.
