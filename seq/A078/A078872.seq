%N A078872 The quintuples (d1,d2,d3,d4,d5) with elements in {2,4,6} are listed in lexicographic order; for each quintuple, this sequence lists the smallest prime p >= 7 such that the differences between the 6 consecutive primes starting with p are (d1,d2,d3,d4,d5), if such a prime exists.
%C A078872 Comment from _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 04 2015: (Start)
%C A078872 The definition of A078872 is fairly subtle.
%C A078872 Step 1: The 3^5 = 243 quintuples (d1,d2,d3,d4,d5) with elements in {2,4,6} are listed in lexicographic order.
%C A078872 Step 2: Study each quintuple in turn.  Look for  the smallest prime p >= 7 such that the differences between the 6 consecutive primes starting with p are (d1,d2,d3,d4,d5).  If there is no such prime move on to next quintuple. If there is at least one such prime, take the smallest one, add it to the sequence, and move on to the next quintuple.
%C A078872 Each quintuple is considered just once, so there are at most 243 terms (in fact there are only 38).
%C A078872 (End)
%C A078872 The 38 quintuples for which p exists are listed, in decimal form, in A078870.
%e A078872 The term 67 corresponds to the quintuple (4,2,6,4,6): 67, 71, 73, 79, 83 and 89 are consecutive primes.
%Y A078872 The quintuples are in A078870. The same primes, in increasing order, are in A078873. The analogous sequences for quadruples and 6-tuples are in A078866 and A078874. Cf. A001223.
