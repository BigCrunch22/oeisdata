%N A078107 Numbers k such that it is not possible to arrange the numbers from 1 to k in a chain with adjacent links summing to a square.
%C A078107 It seems certain, on account of the valences of the underlying graph, that necklaces exist for all larger k, but this may not yet have been proved.
%C A078107 The problem originated (for k = 15) with Bernardo Recam√°n Santos of Colombia. The problem for necklaces is due to Joe Kisenwether.
%C A078107 _Ed Pegg Jr_ and _W. Edwin Clark_ have found necklaces (and hence chains) for k = 32 onwards up to 50 and for several larger numbers.
%C A078107 It has been proven that there are no more terms. See A090461 for details. - _Paolo Xausa_, May 29 2024
