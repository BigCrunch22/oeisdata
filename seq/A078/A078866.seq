%N A078866 The quadruples (d1,d2,d3,d4) with elements in {2,4,6} are listed in lexicographic order; for each quadruple, this sequence lists the smallest prime p >= 5 such that the differences between the 5 consecutive primes starting with p are (d1,d2,d3,d4), if such a prime exists.
%C A078866 The 26 quadruples for which p exists are listed, in decimal form, in A078868.
%e A078866 The term 12637 corresponds to the quadruple (4,6,6,6): 12637, 12641, 12647, 12653 and 12659 are consecutive primes.
%Y A078866 The quadruples are in A078868. The same primes, in increasing order, are in A078867. The sequences of primes corresponding to the 26 difference patterns are in A022006, A022007 and A078946-A078970. Cf. A001223.
