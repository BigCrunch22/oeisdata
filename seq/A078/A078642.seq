%N A078642 Numbers with two representations as the sum of two Fibonacci numbers.
%C A078642 A positive integer n has exactly two representations as the sum of two Fibonacci numbers if and only if n is twice a Fibonacci number and n >= 4. Conjectured by _John W. Layman_, Dec 20 2002. Proved by Max Alekseyev, Mar 02 2007.
%C A078642 From _Max Alekseyev_, Mar 02 2007: (Start)
%C A078642 Suppose that the number m has exactly two representations as the sum of two Fibonacci numbers. There are three types of representations possible:
%C A078642 (I) the sum of two equal Fibonacci numbers
%C A078642 (II) the sum of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers
%C A078642 (III) the sum of two distinct non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers
%C A078642 Lemma. The two representations of m > 2 must be of different types.
%C A078642 Proof. Two representations of m > 2 both of type (I) are not possible as 2*F(n) is a strictly increasing function for n >= 2. Similarly, two representations of m both of type (II) are not possible as F(n) + F(n+1) is a strictly increasing function for n >= 0. Finally, two representations of m both of type (III) are not possible as that would violate the property of the Fibonacci numeral system (the uniqueness of representation of all nonnegative integers).
%C A078642 Consider all possible pairs of representation types:
%C A078642 (I) and (II) are possible only for m = 2: 2 = 2*F(1) = 2*F(2) = F(1) + F(2) but m = 2 has more than two different representations.
%C A078642 (II) and (III) are not possible together as that would again violate the property of the Fibonacci numeral system.
%C A078642 Finally, (I) and (III) gives rise to the sequence of a(n) = 2 * F(n) = F(n+1) + F(n-1). QED (End)

%e A078642 16 has exactly two representations as the sum of Fibonacci numbers: 16 = 3 + 13 and 16 = 8 + 8. Hence 16 belongs to the sequence.
