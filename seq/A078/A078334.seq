%N A078334 Primes in A005728, which counts the terms in the Farey sequence of order n.
%C A078334 Guy, in his Example 8, citing Leo Moser as his source, noted that the first 9 values of A005728(n) = 1 + Sum_{i=1..n} phi(i) = 1 + Sum_{i=1..n} A000010(i) are all primes, but that the pattern breaks down at A005728(10) = 33 = 3*11. As Guy warns, in several paraphrases of the same law, "Capricious coincidences cause careless conjectures." That is, for 1 <= n <= 9 we have A005728(n) = A078334(n), but for n > 9 we sometimes (n = {11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 22, ...}) have A005728(n) prime, but other times (n = {10, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, ...}) have A005728(n) composite.
