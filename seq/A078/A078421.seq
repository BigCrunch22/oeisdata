%N A078421 Least positive integer solution k to h(k) = n h(k-1), where h(n) is the length of n, f(n), f(f(n)), ...., 1 in the Collatz (or 3x + 1) problem. (The earliest "1" is meant.)
%C A078421 1. Recall that f(n) = n/2 if n is even; = 3n + 1 if n is odd. 2. Problem: Is a(n) defined for all n, that is, does a positive integer solution k to h(k) = n h(k-1) always exist? 3. If a(11) is defined, then a(11) > 3 x 10^5.

%e A078421 n, f(n), f(f(n)), ...., 1 for n = 105, 104, respectively, are: 105, 316, 158, 79, 238, 119, 358, 179, 538, 269, 808, 404, 202, 101, 304, 152, 76, 38, 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1; 104, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, of lengths 39 = 3 x 13 and 13, respectively. Hence k = 105 is a solution to h(k) = 3 h(k-1) and it is also the smallest solution. This implies a(3) = 105.
