%N A078675 Number of ways to lace a shoe that has n pairs of eyelets.
%C A078675 The lace must pass through each eyelet exactly once, must begin and end at the extreme pair of eyelets and cannot pass in order though three adjacent eyelets that are in a line.
%C A078675 The lace is "undirected": reversing the order of eyelets along the path does not count as a different solution.

%e A078675 a(3) = 14: label the eyelets 1,2,3 from front to back on the left side then 4,5,6 from back to front on the right side. The lacings are: 124356 154326 153426 142536 145236 132546 135246 125346 124536 125436 152346 153246 152436 154236.
