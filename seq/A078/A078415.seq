%N A078415 Let f(n) = fraction of digits that are nonzero when n is written in base 2 and g(n) the same fraction for base 3. Let h(n) = max {f(n), g(n)}. Sequence gives n for which h(n) sets a new low record.
%C A078415 Suggested by the following question from Andreas Weingartner. Prove or disprove: there exists an epsilon>0 such that no natural number has the property that in base 2 as well as in base 3 at most (epsilon)*100% of the digits are nonzero.

%F A078415 Heuristically one might expect (except possibly for some small examples) such an eps for bases a and b at the solution of: (log(a-1)*log(b)+log(b-1)*log(a))*eps - log(a)*log(b) = (eps*log(eps)+(1-eps)*log(1-eps))*(log(a)+log(b)). For bases 2 and 3 this is about 0.131737...  (Formula and value for eps corrected by _Benne de Weger_, Oct 13 2014)
%e A078415 18 = 10010 in base 2, f(18) = 2/5, 18 = 200 in base 3, g(18) = 1/3, h(n) = max {2/5, 1/3} = 2/5 and this is a new (low) record.
