%N A078459 Numbers n such that in some base b <= log n the sum of the digits of n in base b equals b.
%C A078459 The sequence A018900 refers to b=2. Other sequences with b=3,4,5,... could be considered separately. We present the case that includes the several b, provided that b<=Log(n) (this condition avoids trivial situations). - It is not completely clear how the sequence grows.
%e A078459 In base 4, 67=(1003)_4 and the sum 1+0+0+3 equals 4.
%t A078459 Seq = Function[{m}, Module[{ls, sk}, ls = {}; Do[Do[ sk = Apply[Plus, IntegerDigits[k, b]]; If[sk == b && E^b <= k, AppendTo[ls, k]], {b, 2, Log[k]}], {k, 1, m}]; Union[Sort[ls]] ]]; Seq[1000]
%Y A078459 In a sense this generalizes the sequence A018900 (if b=2 is considered).
