%N A078198 Numbers that cannot be partitioned into distinct powers of 3, 5 and 7, all with positive exponents.
%C A078198 Comment from _Don Reble_, Apr 05 2010: This appears to be a finite sequence. It's straightforward to show that a(377)=40876617, and that there are no more terms below 41583755582761723342524882185. After that, I'm stuck.
%e A078198 6 is here because 3+3 doesn't count (not all distinct); 5+1 doesn't count (zero exponent).
%e A078198 2271 is not a member because 2271 = 3^1+3^2+3^3+3^4+3^5+3^6 + 5^1+5^2+5^3+5^4 + 7^1+7^2+7^3
