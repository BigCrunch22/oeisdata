%N A078674 Number of ways to lace a shoe that has n pairs of eyelets, assuming the lacing satisfies certain conditions.
%C A078674 The lace must follow a Hamiltonian path through the 2n eyelets and cannot pass in order though three adjacent eyelets that are in a line.
%C A078674 The lace is "undirected": reversing the order of eyelets along the path does not count as a different solution (cf. A078629).
%H A078674 <a href="/index/La#lacings">Index entries for sequences related to shoe lacings</a>
%Y A078674 Apart from initial term, A078629/2.
