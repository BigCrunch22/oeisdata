%N A078188 a(1) = 1; for n > 1 take the digits of a(n-1) one after the other and remove one occurrence of this digit from the digits of m = k*n (k > 0) if possible; a(n) is the smallest multiple m of n which has the least number of remaining digits (counted with multiplicity).
%e A078188 For n = 10 we have a(n-1) = a(9) = 9; removing 9 from 9*n = 9*10 = 90 results in one remaining digit (i.e. 0) and for every smaller multiple of 10 (i.e. 10, 20, ..., 80) there are two remaining digits, so a(10) = 90. For n = 20 we have a(n-1) = a(19) = 19; for 1*n = 1*20 = 20 no digit is removed and two digits remain and there is no multiple of 20 which has less than two remaining digits (for 100 twice the digit 0), so a(20) = 20.
