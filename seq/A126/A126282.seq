%N A126282 Median of the largest prime dividing the first 10^n numbers greater than 1.
%C A126282 A randomly selected number <= 10^n (uniform distribution from 2 to 10^n) has a 50% probability of having a prime factor at least as large as a(n).
%e A126282 The largest prime divisors of the nonunit 1-digit numbers are 2, 3, 2, 5, 3, 7, 2 and 3 respectively, with median 3.
%t A126282 f[n_Integer(* n must be even so as to find a true median, not an average, and n must be greater than *)] := Block[{cnt, lmt = n/2, p = PrimePi[n/2], q = PrimePi[n]}, cnt = q - p; p--; While[cnt < lmt, cnt = cnt + Floor[n/Prime@ p]; p-- ]; p++; Prime@ p]; MapAt[# + 1 &, Reap[Do[Sow@ f[10^n], {n, 6}]][[-1, -1]], 1]
