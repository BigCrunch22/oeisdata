%e A126012 25 (= 2^(2*2) + 2^(2*0) + 2^(1+2*1)) encodes the game {-1,0|1}, where, as the option -1 is dominated by option 0, the former can be deleted, giving us the game {0|1}, i.e. the canonical (minimal) form of the game 1/2, encoded as 2^(2*0) + 2^(1+2*1) = 9, thus a(25)=9 and a(9)=9. Similarly a(65536)=1, as 65536 (= 2^(2*(2^(1+2*1)))) encodes the game {{|1}|}, which is reversible to the game {0|}, i.e. the game 1, which is encoded as 2^(2*0) = 1.
%Y A126012 A126011 gives the distinct terms (and also the records).
