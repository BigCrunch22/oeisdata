%N A126200 Numbers n such that n^2 is a sum of consecutive cubes larger than 1.
%C A126200 Note that all triangular numbers A000217(i) have squares A000217(i)^2=A000537(i), which are sums of consecutive cubes starting with 1. But such decompositions are not counted here. - _R. J. Mathar_, Nov 02 2007
%C A126200 Also, the positive integers n such that n^2 is the difference of squares of two positive triangular numbers. - _Max Alekseyev_, Jul 27 2014
%C A126200 Included all cubes > 1.
