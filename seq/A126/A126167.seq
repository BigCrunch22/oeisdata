%N A126167 Number of primitive exponential amicable pairs (i,j) with i<j and i<=10^n.
%C A126167 There are infinitely many exponential amicable pairs, for multiplying an exponential amicable pair by a squarefree integer coprime to each of its members will generate another exponential amicable pair. Accordingly, we refer to pairs like (90972,100548) as primitive exponential amicable pairs and to pairs like (454860,502740) that can be obtained from them as nonprimitive. This sequence counts the primitive pairs only.
