%N A126181 Triangle read by rows, T(n,k) = C(n,k)*Catalan(n-k+1), n >= 0, 0 <= k <= n.
%C A126181 T(n,k) is the number of hex trees with n edges and k nodes having median children (i.e., k vertical edges; 0 <= k <= n). A hex tree is a rooted tree where each vertex has 0, 1, or 2 children and, when only one child is present, it is either a left child, or a median child, or a right child (name due to an obvious bijection with certain tree-like polyhexes; see the Harary-Read paper).
%C A126181 Also, with offset 1, triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of skew Dyck paths of semilength n and having k left steps (n >= 1; 0 <= k <= n-1). A skew Dyck path is a path in the first quadrant which begins at the origin, ends on the x-axis, consists of steps U=(1,1)(up), D=(1,-1)(down) and L=(-1,-1)(left) so that up and left steps do not overlap. The length of a path is defined to be the number of its steps. For example, T(4,2)=6 because we have UDUUUDLL, UUUUDLLD, UUDUUDLL, UUUUDLDL, UUUDUDLL and UUUUDDLL.
%C A126181 Also, with offset 1, number of skew Dyck paths of semilength and having k UDU's. Example: T(3,1)=4 because we have (UDU)UDD, (UDU)UDL, U(UDU)DD and U(UDU)DL (the UDU's are shown between parentheses).

%F A126181 T(n,k) = binomial(n,k)*c(n-k+1), where c(m) = binomial(2m,m)/(m+1) is a Catalan number (A000108). Proof: There are c(n-k+1) binary trees with n-k edges. We can insert k vertical edges at the n-k+1 vertices (repetitions possible) in binomial(n-k+1+k-1,k) = binomial(n,k) ways.
%F A126181 G.f.: G = G(t,z) satisfies G = 1 + (2+t)*z*G + z^2*G^2.
