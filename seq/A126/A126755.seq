%N A126755 Braille numberdromes: numbers which read the same backwards and forwards in Braille.
%C A126755 The pairs 4 and 6, 5 and 9 and 0 and 8 are mirror images of each other. When a Braille number is read backward (as a mirror-image) the number is usually not the same as the original. Those that are the same could be called by analogy with the ordinary numberdromes the Braille numberdromes. Those with "a double yolk", such as 1081, would be Braille numberddromes, by analogy with palinddromes.
%e A126755 a(8) = 46 because in Braille 4 and 6 are mirror images of each other.
%Y A126755 Cf. A121018.
