%N A126237 Length of row n in table A126014.
%C A126237 a(n) is 1 less than the number of distinct codeword lengths in Huffman encoding of n symbols, where the k-th symbol has frequency k.

%F A126237 I conjecture that there are no gaps in the set of codeword lengths; that is, every integer that's between the minimum and maximum codeword lengths occurs as a codeword length. If so, then a(n) = A126236(n) - A126235(n). If, in addition, the conjectured formulas for the min and max lengths are correct, then a(n) = floor(log_2(n)) unless n has the form 3*2^k-1, in which case a(n) = floor(log_2(n)) - 1. This is true at least for n up to 1000.
%e A126237 Row 8 of A126014 is (6,3,2), so a(8)=3.
%Y A126237 Cf. A126014. The minimum length of a codeword is in A126235. The maximum length is in A126236.
