%N A126110 Number of misere quotients of order 2n.
%C A126110 Siegel's abstract: "A bipartite monoid is a commutative monoid Q together with an identified subset P subset of Q. In this paper we study a class of bipartite monoids, known as misere quotients, that are naturally associated to impartial combinatorial games. We introduce a structure theory for misere quotients with |P| = 2 and give a complete classification of all such quotients up to isomorphism. One consequence is that if |P| = 2 and Q is finite, then |Q| = 2^n+2 or 2^n+4. We then develop computational techniques for enumerating misere quotients of small order and apply them to count the number of non-isomorphic quotients of order at most 18. We also include a manual proof that there is exactly one quotient of order 8." [Quotation corrected by Thane Plambeck, Jul 08 2014]
