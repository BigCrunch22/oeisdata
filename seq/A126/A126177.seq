%N A126177 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is number of hex trees with n edges and k leaves (n >= 1, 1 <= k <= 1 + floor(n/2)).
%C A126177 A hex tree is a rooted tree where each vertex has 0, 1, or 2 children and, when only one child is present, it is either a left child, or a middle child, or a right child (name due to an obvious bijection with certain tree-like polyhexes; see the Harary-Read paper).
%C A126177 Also number of hex trees with n edges and k-1 nodes of outdegree 2.
%C A126177 Row n has 1 + floor(n/2) terms.
%C A126177 Sum of terms in row n = A002212(n+1).
%C A126177 T(n,1) = 3^n (A000244).
%C A126177 T(n,2) = A027472(n+1).
%C A126177 Sum_{k=1..1+floor(n/2)} k*T(n,k) = A026375(n).

%F A126177 T(n,k) = 3^(n-2k+2)*binomial(2k-2,k-1)*binomial(n,2k-2)/k. Proof: There are Catalan(k-1) full binary trees with k leaves. Each of them has 2k-2 edges. Additional n-2k+2 edges can be inserted as paths at the existing 2k-1 vertices in 3^(n-2k+2)*binomial(n,2k-2) ways.
%F A126177 G.f.: G=G(t,z) satisfies z^2*G^2-(1-3z-2tz^2)G+tz(3+tz)=0.
