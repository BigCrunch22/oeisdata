%N A126789 a(n) is the smallest number such that the product of its digits is n times the sum of its digits, or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A126789 a(11) = 0. Proof: 11 is a prime number and the product of digits of a number in base 10 can never be a multiple of 11. - _Stefan Steinerberger_, Jun 07 2007
%C A126789 More generally, a(n) = 0 for all n which are divisible by a prime bigger than 7. This means that the sequence will almost always be 0 (with the set of exceptions having density 0). In each term the digits will be increasing (otherwise we could rearrange the digits so that they form a smaller number with the specified property). If no prime factors of n exceed 7, does this mean that a(n) is not 0? - _Stefan Steinerberger_, Jun 14 2007

%e A126789 a(2)=36 because 3*6/(3+6) = 2 and no number smaller than 36 has this property.
