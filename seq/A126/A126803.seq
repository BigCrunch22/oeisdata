%C A126803 The sequence is infinite; e.g., any number whose decimal expansion begins and ends with 14 and contains only the digits 1, 4 and 8 dies in 9 generations. It has density zero, because any number containing the digit string 14405930 emits a lightweight spaceship which can't be stopped by whatever the rest of the number produces.
