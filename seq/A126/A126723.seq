%N A126723 Irregular triangle read by rows: row n (>= 1) gives coefficients c(0), c(1), c(2),... arising from the greedy-algorithm representation of n as n = c(0)/x + c(1)/x^2 + c(2)/x^3 + ..., where x = (1+sqrt(5))/2.
%C A126723 _Max Alekseyev_ (see link below) proved the following: suppose that N = c(1)F(1) - c(2)F(2) + c(3)F(3) - ..., where F(i) are Fibonacci numbers and each coefficient c(i) is either 0 or 1 with no adjacent unit coefficients. Then these coefficients are exactly those produced by the greedy algorithm: N = c(0)/x + c(1)/x^2 + c(2)/x^3 + ... . It follows that there are only finitely many nonzero terms and that the representation is unique for the stated properties.
%C A126723 c(0)=Floor(N*x) (as in A000201, the lower Wythoff sequence). Thus as N*x-c(0) is the fractional part {N*x} of N*x, we have {N*x} represented as a sum of finitely many fractions 1/x^k.
