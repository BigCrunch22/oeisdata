%N A126848 Arises in lower bound of the spectral norm of n X n symmetric random matrices.
%C A126848 Abstract: "We show that the spectral radius of an N times N random symmetric matrix with i.i.d. bounded centered but non-symmetrically distributed entries is bounded from below by 2 *sigma - o(N^{-6/11+\epsilon}), where sigma^2 is the variance of the matrix entries and epsilon is an arbitrary small positive number. Combining with our previous result from [6], this proves that for any epsilon > 0, one has |A_N| =2*sigma + o(N^{-6/11+epsilon}) with probability going to 1 as N goes to infinity." In this sequence, we computer a lower bound under the artificial assumption that sigma = n. Records for a(n) are for n = 1, 3, 5, 8, 12, 16, 22, 28, 35, 43, 52, 62, 73.
