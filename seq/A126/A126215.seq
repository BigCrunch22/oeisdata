%N A126215 a(1)=1. a(n) = sum of the earlier terms, a(k) (for 1<=k<=n-1), where every integer coprime to a(k) and <= a(k) is also coprime to n.
%e A126215 The positive integers coprime to a(k) and <= a(k), for 1<=k<=8, are for a(1):{1}, for a(2):{1}, for a(3):{1}, for a(4):{1,3}, for a(5):{1,3,5,7}, for a(6):{1,3}, for a(7):{1,5,7,11} and for a(8):{1,3,5,7,...,29,31}.
%e A126215 Those terms a(k), 1<=k<=8, which don't have any integers which are not coprime to 9 among those positive integers which are <=a(k) and coprime to a(k) are the terms a(1)=1,a(2)=1,a(3)=2 and a(7)=12. So a(9) = 1+1+2+12 = 16.
