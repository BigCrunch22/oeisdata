%N A126014 Triangle read by rows, based on Huffman encoding. See comments.
%C A126014 Row #n pertains to Huffman encoding of n symbols, where the k-th symbol has frequency k. Let b(k) be the number of bits used to encode the symbol of frequency k. The row has the values of k such that b(k)>b(k+1).
%C A126014 Each row is ordered descendingly; each ends with '2'. Row #3 is first.

%e A126014 In row #8, the frequencies are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and a Huffman encoding is (1->00000, 2->00001, 3->0001, 4->001, 5->010, 6->011, 7->10, 8->11). The codes shrink after k=6,3,2; so row #8 has 6,3,2.

%Y A126014 The length of the n-th row is in A126237. The minimum and maximum lengths of codewords are in A126235 and A126236.
