%N A126201 Number of rooted connected unlabeled planar graphs on n nodes.
%C A126201 Number of "pointed" connected planar graphs on n nodes: number of pairs (G,P) where G is a connected unlabeled planar graph with n nodes and P runs through the orbit representatives of nodes in G under the action of Aut(G).
%C A126201 For n <= 4 this agrees with A126100; a(5) = A126100(5) - 1 = 57, since K_5 is the only excluded graph on 5 nodes.
%Y A126201 Cf. A005470, A039735, A126100.
