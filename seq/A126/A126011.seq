%N A126011 A106486-encodings for the minimal representatives of each equivalence class of the finite combinatorial games.
%C A126011 The initial terms correspond with the following games: code 0 = {|} = the zero game, code 1 = {0|} = game 1, code 2 = {|0} = game -1, code 3 = {0|0} = game *, code 4 = {1|} = game 2, code 6 = {1|0}, code 9 = {0|1} = game 1/2, code 12 = {1|1} = game 1*, code 18 = {-1|0} = game -1/2, code 32 = {|-1} = game -2, code 33 = {0|-1}, code 36 = {1|-1} = game +-1, code 48 = {-1|-1} = game -1*, code 66 = {*|0} = game down, code 67 = {0,*|0} = game up*, code 96 = {*|-1}, code 97 = {0,*|-1}, code 129 = {0|*} = game up, code 131 = {0|0,*} = game down*, code 132 = {1|*}, code 134 = {1|0,*}, code 195 = {0,*|0,*} = game *2, code 256 = {2|} = game 3. Encoding is explained in A106486.
