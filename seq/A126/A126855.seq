%N A126855 Numbers k such that, if k = product{p|k} p^c(k,p), each c(k,p) is a positive integer and each p is a distinct prime, then the smallest prime-power p^c(k, p) is not a power of the smallest prime dividing k.
%C A126855 The numbers of terms not exceeding 10^k, for k=1,2,...., are 0, 11, 128, 1245, 12474, 124052, 1240434, 12398594, 123976845, 1239840735, ... Apparently this sequence has an asymptotic density 0.1239... - _Amiram Eldar_, Mar 20 2021

%e A126855 3600 is included because 3600 = 2^4 * 3^2 * 5^2 and the smallest prime-power (which is largest prime-power of its prime to divide 3600), 3^2 = 9, is not a power of the smallest prime to divide 3600, which is 2.
