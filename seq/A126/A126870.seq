%N A126870 a(1)=1. a(n) = number of earlier terms of the sequence which are coprime to the sum of distinct prime divisors of n.
%e A126870 The sum of the distinct prime divisors of 12 is 2+3 = 5. So a(12) is the number of terms from among (a(1),a(2),...a(11)) which are coprime to 5. There are 9 such terms, so a(12) = 9.
