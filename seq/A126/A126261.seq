%N A126261 a(n) is the numerator of the sum of the reciprocals of the positive integers k, k<=n, where every positive integer <= k and coprime to k is also coprime to n.
%e A126261 The positive integers k, k <= 6, where every positive integer <=k and coprime to k is also coprime to 6, are 1,2,6. So a(6) = 5 is the numerator of 1 +1/2 +1/6 = 5/3.
