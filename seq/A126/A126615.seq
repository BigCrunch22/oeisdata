%N A126615 Denominators in a harmonic triangle.
%C A126615 The harmonic triangle uses the terms of this sequence as denominators, with numerators = 1: (1/1; 1/2, 1/2; 1/2, 1/6, 1/3; 1/2, 1/6, 1/12, 1/4; 1/2, 1/6, 1/12, 1/10, 1/5; ...). Row sums of the harmonic triangle = 1.
%F A126615 Denominators of the inverse of A127949; numerators = 1. Triangle read by rows, first (n-1) terms of 1*2, 2*3, 3*4, ...; followed by "n".

%A A126615 _Gary W. Adamson_, Feb 09 2007
%E A126615 _Gary W. Adamson_ submitted two different triangles numbered A127899 based on the harmonic numbers. This is the second of them, which I am renumbering as A126615. Unfortunately there were several other entries defined in terms of "A127899" and I may not have guessed which version of A127899 was being referred to. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 09 2007
