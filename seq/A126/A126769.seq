%N A126769 Primes p of the form k^4 + s where k > 1, s >= 1 and k^2 + s is also prime.
%C A126769 For primes not in this sequence see A128292.
%C A126769 Conjecture: Every prime q > 3 can be written in a nontrivial way as the sum of two or more squares, q = Sum_{i} (k_i)^2, such that the sum of the fourth powers of the squared numbers is again prime, p = Sum_{i} (k_i)^4. (Tomas Xordan)
%C A126769 This sequence illustrates an easy case of the conjecture: For primes q arising in the sequence there exists an integer k > 1, a positive integer s and a prime p such that k^2 < q, s = q - k^2, p = k^4 + s and p > q.
%C A126769 This corresponds to the case where only one of the squares is larger than 1 and all other s terms are equal to 1. - _M. F. Hasler_, May 23 2018

%e A126769 19 = 2^4+3 is prime and 2^2+3 = 7 is a smaller prime, hence 19 is a term.
%e A126769 23 = 2^4+7 is prime and 2^2+7 = 11 is a smaller prime, hence 23 is a term.
%e A126769 1307 = 6^4+11 is prime and 6^2+11 = 47 is a smaller prime, hence 1307 is a term.
%e A126769 37 is prime, 2^4+21 is the only way to write 37 as k^4+s, but neither 2^2+21 = 25 nor 3^2+21 = 30 are prime, hence 37 is not in the sequence.
