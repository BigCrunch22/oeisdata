%N A126682 Square pyramid giving coefficients of Carlo Wood's polynomials, read by successive slices, each slice being read row by row.
%C A126682 There is no standard method for converting a pyramid of numbers to a sequence. This seems as good a solution as any.
%C A126682 See the link for further information and more terms.
%C A126682 The first row of each slice seems to coincide with the first row of each slice of A335442. That row from the n-th slice seems to be the coefficients of the polynomial (x+1) * ... * (x+n-1), i.e., the reversed row n-1 of A130534. - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Jun 26 2022
