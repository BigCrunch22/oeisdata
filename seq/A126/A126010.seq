%N A126010 Square array A(g,h) = 1 if combinatorial games g and h have the same value, 0 if they differ, listed antidiagonally in order A(0,0), A(1,0), A(0,1), A(2,0), A(1,1), A(0,2), ...
%C A126010 Here we use the encoding described in A106486.

%e A126010 A(4,5) = A(5,4) = 1 because 5 encodes the game {0,1|}, where, because the option 1 dominates the option 0 on the left side, the zero can be deleted, resulting the game {1|}, the canonical form of the game 2, which is encoded as 4.
%Y A126010 Row 0 is the characteristic function of A125991 (shifted one step). A(i, j) = A125999(i, j)*A125999(j, i). A126011 gives the A106486-encodings for the minimal representatives of each equivalence class of finite combinatorial games.
