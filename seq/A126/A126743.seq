%N A126743 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) (n>=1) gives the number of n-indecomposable polyominoes with k cells (k >= 2n).
%C A126743 A polyomino is called n-indecomposable if it cannot be partitioned (along cell boundaries) into two or more polyominoes each with at least n cells.
%C A126743 Row n has 4n-3 terms of which the first 2n-1 are zero.
%C A126743 For full lists of drawings of these polyominoes for n <= 6, see the links in A125759.
