%N A126762 a(n) is the least k > n such that the remainder when n^k is divided by k is n.
%C A126762 a(n-1) = n for n = {2,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,...} = 2 together with odd numbers n > 1.
%C A126762 a(n) coincides with A082048(n) up to n = 24.
%C A126762 a(n) is the smallest number k > n such that n^k == n (mod k). Conjecture: a(n) is the smallest number k > n such that n^(k-1) == 1 (mod k). Thus a(n) is coprime to n. - _Thomas Ordowski_, Aug 03 2018
