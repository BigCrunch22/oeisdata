%N A126688 Lowest base in which n has distinct digits.
%C A126688 Start with binary and work upwards, expressing n in the given base (2,3,4... b). The term a(n)=b is the lowest base in which no two digits in n are the same.
%C A126688 See A123699 for another version of the same sequence. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jun 15 2008
%e A126688 75 is 1001011 in binary (base 2), 2210 in base 3 and 1023 in base 4. So a(75) = 4 since 1023 has distinct digits (and neither 1001011 nor 2210 do).
