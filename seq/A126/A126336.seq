%N A126336 Irregular table where the first row is (1). Row n is the continued fraction terms of the rational equal to the sum of the reciprocals of all the terms in the previous rows.
%C A126336 The continued fractions, for rows 3 and up, each have a final term >= 2.
%C A126336 The number of terms in the n-th row is A126337(n).
%C A126336 The sum of the reciprocals of the terms in rows 1 through n is A126338(n)/A126339(n).
%H A126336 Michael De Vlieger, <a href="/A126336/b126336.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..11269</a> (rows 1 <= n <= 80).
%e A126336 The sum of the reciprocals of the terms of the first 6 rows is 1 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/3 = 59/12. 59/12 equals the continued fraction 4 + 1/(1 + 1/11). So row 7 is (4,1,11).
