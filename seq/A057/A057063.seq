%N A057063 Let P(n) of a sequence s(1),s(2),s(3),... be obtained by leaving s(1),...,s(n) fixed and reverse-cyclically permuting every n consecutive terms thereafter; apply P(2) to 1,2,3,... to get PS(2), then apply P(3) to PS(2) to get PS(3), then apply P(4) to PS(3), etc. The limit of PS(n) is A057063.
%C A057063 It appears that this is a permutation of the integers. - _Michel Marcus_, Feb 19 2016
%C A057063 The fact that this is a permutation is proved at the MathOverflow link below. Also from that link: a(n)+1 is prime if and only if a(n) = 2*(n-1). - _Ilya I. Bogdanov_, Feb 15 2022
%C A057063 From _Jianing Song_, Sep 27 2023: (Start)
%C A057063 Let {b(n)} be the inverse permutation of this sequence, then each number n >= 3 is moved for b(n)-2 times during the process.
%C A057063 Proof: suppose that this number is k, which is well-defined since PS(1), PS(2), ... has a limit. Suppose that PS(i+1)(c_i) = n for each i >= 0, that is, c_i is the index of n after i steps. In the (i+1)-th step, each group of PS(i+1) contains i+2 elements, and every element is moved if and only if it has index at least i+3. We obtain that k = #{i >= 0 : c_i >= i+3}.
%C A057063 Note that if c_i <= i+2 for some i, then from the (i+1)-th step on, each group contains at least i+2 numbers so the first i+2 numbers in the sequence remain fixed, which means that n = PS(i+1)(c_i) = PS(i+2)(c_i) = ... = a(c_i), so c_i = c_{i+1} = ... = b(n). This shows that {i >= 0 : c_i >= i+3} = {0, 1, ..., k-1}, which implies that k is the smallest number such that c_k <= k+2. On one hand, since c_k <= k+2, we have c_k = b(n), so b(n) <= k+2. On the other hand, from the (b(n)-1)-th step on, each group contains at least b(n) numbers so the first b(n) numbers in the sequence remain fixed, which means that PS(b(n)-1)(b(n)) = PS(b(n))(b(n)) = ... = a(b(n)) = n, so c_{b(n)-2} = b(n), and k <= b(n)-2. In conclusion, we have k = b(n)-2.
%C A057063 By the MathOverflow link, we have a(n) <= 2*n-2 for all n, where the equality holds if and only if a(n)+1 is prime. On the other hand, it is hard to get a lower bound for {a(n)}, so it is infeasible to calculate the inverse permutation of this sequence. (End)
