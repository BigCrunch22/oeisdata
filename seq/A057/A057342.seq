%N A057342 Largest of the most frequently occurring numbers in 1-to-n 4-dimensional multiplication table.
%e A057342 M(n) is the array in which m(x,y,z,t)=x*y*z*t for x = 1 to n, y = 1 to n, z = 1 to n and t = 1 to n In M(7), the most frequently occurring numbers are 60, 72, 84, 120 and 168, each occurring 60 times. The largest of these numbers is 168, so a(7) = 168.
