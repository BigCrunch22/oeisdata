%N A057750 Number of non-factorable subsets of size >= 2 of a 1 X n uniform grid.
%C A057750 A set is factorable if it is the union of at least two disjoint translated copies of a subset of at least two elements. E.g. the subset *..*.**..***.*.* of the 1x16 grid (where * denotes gridpoints in the selected subset and . denotes the remaining unselected gridpoints) is factorable into 3 copies of the 3-element subset *..*.*, as shown by displaying the factors by 1..1.12..232.3.3, where the numerals denote the elements of a particular translated copy.
%F A057750 a(n) = 2^n - (n+1) - A057765(n). - _Sean A. Irvine_, Jun 26 2022
%e A057750 The factorable subsets of (......) are (1122..), (11.22.), (.1122.), (1.12.2), (11..22), (.11.22), (..1122) and (111222) and there are seven subsets with fewer than 2 elements, so a(6)=2^6-8-7=49.
