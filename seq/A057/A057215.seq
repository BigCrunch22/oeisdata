%N A057215 [1->01, 2->10, 3->01]-transform of 3-symbol Thue-Morse A026600.
%C A057215 Old name was: Analog of A026600 using instead of 1: 0,1; instead of 2: 1,0; instead of 3: 0,1.
%C A057215 A nonperiodic sequence of 0 and 1, with one 0 and one 1 in every subsequence of three terms.
%C A057215 From _Michel Dekking_, Apr 17 2019: (Start):
%C A057215 (a(n)) is a morphic sequence, i.e., a letter-to-letter projection of a fixed point of a morphism.
%C A057215 Let the morphism sigma be given by
%C A057215     1->123, 2->456, 3->345, 4->612, 5->561, 6->234,
%C A057215 and let the letter-to-letter map delta be given by
%C A057215     1->0, 2->1, 3->1, 4->0, 5->0, 6->1.
%C A057215 Then (a(n)) = delta(x), with x the fixed point of sigma starting with 1.
%C A057215 This representation can be obtained by doubling 1,2 and 3, and renaming the resulting six letters as 1,2,3,4,5,6.
%C A057215 (End)
%C A057215 This sequence essentially equals A026605, which is its standard form: a(n) = A026605(n)-1 for all n. - _Michel Dekking_, Apr 18 2019
