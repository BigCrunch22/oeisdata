%N A203899 Number of support partitions-vertices.
%C A203899 This sequence is the sequence of the numbers of support vertices of the integer partition polytopes.  As in A203898, partitions of n are considered as the points x in R^n; the integer partition polytope P_n is the convex hull of all partitions of n. A vertex x of P_n is called support if it cannot be obtained from any other vertex of P_n with the use of any of the two operations of merging parts: (i) substituting x_u parts u of x by one part x_{u}u, (ii) substituting x_u parts u and x_v-x_u parts v of x, x_u <= x_v, by x_u parts u+v. These operations result in vertices if applied to vertices.
%C A203899 Support vertices of P_n form a basis for the set of partitions of n. This sequence was computed by A. S. Vroublevski.

%e A203899 Application of the operation (i) with u=1 to the vertex x=(2,0,1,0,0) of P_5 results in the vertex y=(0,1,1,0,0), while application of the operation (ii) with u=3, v=1 to x results in the vertex z=(1,0,0,1,0). Hence, both y and z are not support vertices of P_5.
