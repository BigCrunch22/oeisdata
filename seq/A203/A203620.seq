%N A203620 A self-describing sequence: when the sequence is read as a string of digits, a(n) says the position of the digits that are prime.
%C A203620 Digits in position a(n) are prime, namely 2, 3, 5 or 7. Any step chooses the minimum integer not yet present in the sequence and not leading to a contradiction.
%H A203620 <a href="/index/Sa#swys">Index to sequences related to say what you see</a>
%e A203620 The sequence cannot start with 1 because the first digit, 1 itself, is not prime. Then let us put 2. The next digit must be prime: 3. Even the third must be prime: 5. No specific indications for the fourth digit. We can choose 1 because the first digit, 2, is prime. The fifth must be prime: 7. And so on.
%Y A203620 Cf. A114315 and A121053.
