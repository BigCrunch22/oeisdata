%N A203945 Symmetric matrix based on (1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,...), by antidiagonals.
%C A203945 Let s be the periodic sequence (1,0,0,1,0,0,...)  and let T be the infinite square matrix whose n-th row is formed by putting n-1 zeros before the terms of s.  Let T' be the transpose of T.  Then A203945 represents the matrix product M=T'*T.  M is the self-fusion matrix of s, as defined at A193722.  See A203946 for characteristic polynomials of principal submatrices of M, with interlacing zeros.
