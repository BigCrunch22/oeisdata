%N A325116 Length of longest run of consecutive even integers having exactly n divisors.
%C A325116 The start of the first run of exactly k consecutive even integers having exactly n divisors is A325117(n,k).
%C A325116 If m does not divide n, then a(n) < 2^(m-1). Proof: 2^(m-1) consecutive even integers must include one congruent to 2^(m-1) mod 2^m, and the number of divisors of this one is a multiple of m.
%C A325116 For m > 2, if 2*(m-1) does not divide n, then a(n) < 2^(m-1). Proof: 2^(m-1) consecutive even integers must include two congruent to 2^(m-2) mod 2^(m-1). These are 2^(m-2)*x and 2^(m-2)*(x+2) for some odd x, and x and x+2 each have n/(m-1) divisors. If 2*(m-1) does not divide n, then n/(m-1) is odd. Any number with an odd number of divisors is a square, so x and x+2 are squares, but squares cannot differ by 2.
%C A325116 14 <= a(24) <= 15. Dickson's conjecture implies a(24)=15.
