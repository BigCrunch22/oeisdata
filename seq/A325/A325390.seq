%N A325390 Heinz number of the negated differences plus one of the integer partition with Heinz number n (with the last part taken to be 0).
%C A325390 The Heinz number of a positive integer sequence (y_1,...,y_k) is prime(y_1)*...*prime(y_k).
%C A325390 The differences of a sequence are defined as if the sequence were increasing, so for example the differences of (6,3,1) (with the last part taken to be 0) are (-3,-2,-1).

%e A325390 The Heinz number of (6,3,1) is 130, and its negated differences plus one are (4,3,2), which has Heinz number 105, so a(130) = 105.
