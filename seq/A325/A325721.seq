%N A325721 Start the sequence with a(1) = 1 and read the digits one by one from there. The sequence is always extended with the sum d + k, d being the digit read and k the number of d digits present so far in the sequence.

%e A325721 The sequence starts with a(1) = 1.
%e A325721 We read this 1, see that there is only one digit 1 so far in the sequence, thus k = 1; we have then d + k = (1 + 1) = 2 and this 2 becomes a(2);
%e A325721 We read this 2, see that there is only one digit 2 so far in the sequence, thus k = 1; we have then d + k = (2 + 1) = 3 and this 3 becomes a(3);
%e A325721 We read this 3, see that there is only one digit 3 so far in the sequence, thus k = 1; we have then d + k = (3 + 1) = 4 and this 4 becomes a(4);
%e A325721 ...
%e A325721 We now read the first digit of a(10) = 10, see that this 1 is the 2nd digit 1 so far in the sequence, thus k = 2; we have then d + k = (1 + 2) = 3 and this 3 becomes a(11);
%e A325721 We now read the second digit of a(10) = 10, see that this 0 is the 1st digit 0 so far in the sequence, thus k = 1; we have then d + k = 1 and this 1 becomes a(12);
%e A325721 We now read the single digit of a(11) = 3; we see that this 3 is the 2nd digit 3 so far in the sequence, thus k = 2; we have then d + k = 5 and this 5 becomes a(13); etc.
