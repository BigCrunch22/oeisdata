%N A325776 a(n) is the least nonnegative integer such that n concatenated with a(n) is a boomerang number (A308306), or -1 if n is a boomerang number.
%C A325776 Old title was: "a(n) is the smallest number bringing back n on its first digit, using the 'boomerang protocol' explained in A308306."
%C A325776 A similar sequence, but with no duplicate term, is A325775.
%C A325776 If a(n) = -1, then n is a "boomerang number" (see A308306).
%C A325776 The "boomerang protocol" sends 1 to the left (as 1 is odd), jumping over exactly 1 cell. To "bring back" 1 to its initial cell, the smallest integer is 102. Let's see how:
%C A325776 Our initial 1 starts here (dots are cells):
%C A325776 ....1....
%C A325776 and ends there (S is the starting cell):
%C A325776 ..1.S....
%C A325776 We have this pattern now for the "bring back" integer (S is the new start, A the Arrival cell we want to reach, which was the starting cell of 1):
%C A325776 ..S.A....
%C A325776 The smallest integer starting on S and ending on A is 102:
%C A325776 ..1.A....
%C A325776 0...A....
%C A325776 .2..A....
%C A325776 The integer 120 does the same job, as does also 1410 - but we keep 102 as 102 is the smallest available integer.

%e A325776 The sequence starts with 102,25,20,27,22,29,24,90,... We see that:
%e A325776 a(1) = 102 means that 102 will bring 1 back in its initial cell;
%e A325776 a(2) = 25 means that 25 will bring 2 back in its initial cell;
%e A325776 a(3) = 20 means that 20 will bring 3 back in its initial cell;
%e A325776 a(4) = 27 means that 27 will bring 4 back in its initial cell;
%e A325776 a(5) = 22 means that 22 will bring 5 back in its initial cell;
%e A325776 The general rule being that a(n) is the smallest number bringing back n in its initial cell.
%e A325776 a(100) = -1 means that 100 is a "boomerang number": it "comes back" by itself without any external help. Those numbers are listed in A308306.
%e A325776 a(1) is not 0, since even though the least boomerang number beginning with 1 is 100, leading zeroes are not allowed. - _Charlie Neder_, Jun 03 2019
