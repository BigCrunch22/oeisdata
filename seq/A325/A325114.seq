%N A325114 Integers k such that no nonzero subsequence of the decimal representation of k is divisible by 7.
%C A325114 Does not contain 114 (helps to distinguish this from related sequences).
%C A325114 From _David A. Corneth_, Sep 10 2024: (Start)
%C A325114 Any term greater than 10^6 must have a digit 0. Proof: Any term between 10^6 and 10^7 has a 0.
%C A325114 Proof via induction and contradiction; any 7 digital number term has a digit 0. Suppose some number with k with q > 7 digits has no digit 0. Then floor(k/10) is a term and has no digit 0 and q - 1 digits. But there is no such number. A contradiction. Therefore any term with at least 7 digits has a digit 0. (End)
