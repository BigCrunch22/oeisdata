%N A325391 Number of reversed integer partitions of n whose k-th differences are strictly increasing for all k >= 0.
%C A325391 The differences of a sequence are defined as if the sequence were increasing, so for example the differences of (6,3,1) are (-3,-2).
%C A325391 The zeroth differences of a sequence are the sequence itself, while the k-th differences for k > 0 are the differences of the (k-1)-th differences.
%C A325391 The Heinz numbers of these partitions are given by A325398.
