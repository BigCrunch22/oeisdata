%N A325010 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of chiral pairs of colorings of the facets of a regular n-dimensional orthotope using exactly k colors. Row n has 2n columns.
%C A325010 Also called hypercube, n-dimensional cube, and measure polytope. For n=1, the figure is a line segment with two vertices. For n=2 the figure is a square with four edges. For n=3 the figure is a cube with six square faces. For n=4, the figure is a tesseract with eight cubic facets. The SchlÃ¤fli symbol, {4,3,...,3}, of the regular n-dimensional orthotope (n>1) consists of a four followed by n-2 threes. Each of its 2n facets is an (n-1)-dimensional orthotope. The chiral colorings of its facets come in pairs, each the reflection of the other.
%C A325010 Also the number of chiral pairs of colorings of the vertices of a regular n-dimensional orthoplex using exactly k colors.

%F A325010 T(n,k) = Sum{j=0..k-2} binomial(j-k-1,j) * binomial(binomial(k-j,2),n).
%F A325010 T(n,k) = A325008(n,k) - A325009(n,k) = (A325008(n,k) - A325011(n,k)) / 2 = A325009(n,k) - A325011(n,k).
