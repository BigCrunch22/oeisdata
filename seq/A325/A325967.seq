%N A325967 a(n) is the minimum sum of all such subsets of divisors of n for which n-s and (sigma(n)-s)-n are relatively prime, where s is the sum of the subset.
%C A325967 Partition the divisors of n in all possible ways into such complementary subsets x and y for which gcd(n-Sum(x), n-Sum(y)) = 1. a(n) is the minimal value of min(Sum(x), Sum(y)) attained over all such pairs of subsets x and y.

%C A325967 Equivalently, the least k expressible as a sum of distinct divisors of n such that gcd(n-k,A033879(n)) = 1, with the convention that gcd(k,0) = k. - _Charlie Neder_, Jun 09 2019

%F A325967 a(n) = A000203(n) - A325968(n) = A001065(n) - A325969(n).
%F A325967 For all n, a(A000396(n)) = A000396(n)-1.
%F A325967 For all n, a(n) >= A325817(n).
%e A325967 For n=15, its divisors are [1, 3, 5, 15]. If we take an empty set [] and its complement [1, 3, 5, 15], their sums are 0 and 24, but gcd(15-0, 24-15) = gcd(15, 9) = 3 > 1. If we take subsets [1] and [3, 5, 15], then their sums are 1 and 23, but gcd(15-1, 23-15) = gcd(14,8) = 2 > 1. If we take subsets [3] and [1, 5, 15], their sums are 3 and 21, but gcd(15-3, 21-15) = gcd(12, 6) = 6 > 1. Only when we take the subset with a next larger sum, [1, 3] and its complement [5, 15], we get such sums 4 and 20 for which gcd(15-4, 20-15) = gcd(11, 5) = 1. Thus a(15) = 4, the size of the subset with lesser sum.
