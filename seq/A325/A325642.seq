%N A325642 a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) = k for the least divisor d > 1 of n such that A048720(d,k) = n for some k.
%C A325642 For n > 1, we first find the least divisor d of n that is larger than 1 and for which it holds that when the binary expansion of d is converted to a (0,1)-polynomial (e.g., 13=1101[2] encodes X^3 + X^2 + 1), then that polynomial is a divisor of (0,1)-polynomial similarly converted from n, when the division is done over GF(2). a(n) is then the quotient polynomial converted back to decimal via its binary encoding. See the example.

%F A325642 For all n >= 1, A048720(a(n), A325643(n)) = n.
%e A325642 For n = 9, its least nontrivial divisor is 3, and we find that 3 (in binary "11") corresponds to polynomial X + 1, which in this case is a factor of polynomial X^3 + 1 (corresponding to 9 as 9 is "1001" in binary) as the latter factorizes as (X + 1)(X^2 + X + 1) over GF(2), that is, 9 = A048720(3,7). Thus a(9) = 7.
