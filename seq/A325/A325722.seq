%N A325722 Start the sequence with a(1) = 1 and read the digits one by one from there. The sequence is always extended with the product d*k, d being the digit read and k the number of d digits present so far in the sequence.

%e A325722 The sequence starts with a(1) = 1.
%e A325722 We read this 1, see that there is only one digit 1 so far in the sequence, thus k = 1; we have then d*k = 1 and this 1 becomes a(2);
%e A325722 We read a(2) = 1, see that this 1 is the 2nd digit 1 so far in the sequence, thus k = 2; we have then d*k = 2 and this 2 becomes a(3);
%e A325722 We read a(3) = 2, see that there is only one digit 2 so far in the sequence, thus k = 1; we have then d*k = 2 and this 2 becomes a(4);
%e A325722 We read a(4) = 2, see that this 2 is the 2nd digit 2 so far in the sequence, thus k = 2; we have then d*k = 4 and this 4 becomes a(5);
%e A325722 ...
%e A325722 We read now the first digit of a(9) = 16 and see that this 1 is the 3rd digit 1 so far in the sequence, thus k = 3; we have then d*k = 3 and this 3 becomes a(10);
%e A325722 We read now the second digit of a(9) = 16 and see that this 6 is the 1st digit 6 so far in the sequence, thus k = 1; we have then d*k = 6 and this 6 becomes a(11); etc.
%Y A325722 Cf. A325721 where the same idea is developed, but with d+k instead of d*k. See also A308232 for the concatenation kd.
