%N A325364 Heinz numbers of integer partitions whose differences (with the last part taken to be zero) are weakly decreasing.
%C A325364 The Heinz number of an integer partition (y_1,...,y_k) is prime(y_1)*...*prime(y_k).
%C A325364 The differences of a sequence are defined as if the sequence were increasing, so for example the differences of (x, y, z) are (y - x, z - y). We adhere to this standard for integer partitions also even though they are always weakly decreasing. For example, the differences of (6,3,1) (with the last part taken to be 0) are (-3,-2,-1).
%C A325364 The enumeration of these partitions by sum is given by A320509.
