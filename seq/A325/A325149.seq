%N A325149 Squares which can be expressed as the product of a number and its reverse in exactly one way.
%C A325149 The first 47 terms of this sequence (from 0 to 58564) are identical to the first 47 terms of A325148. The square 63504 is not present because it can be expressed in two ways: 63504 = 252 * 252 = 144 * 441.
%C A325149 There are three families of squares in this sequence:
%C A325149 1) Squares of palindromes in A002113\A117281.
%C A325149 2) Squares of non-palindromes which form the sequence A325151.
%C A325149 These squares are a subsequence of A076750.
%C A325149 3) Squares of (m*10^q) with q >= 1 and m palindrome in A002113\A117281.
