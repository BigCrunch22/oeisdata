%N A325775 Numbers that bring back the last digit of n on its first digit, using the "boomerang protocol" explained in A308306, with no duplicate term (except the -1 terms). See the Comments and Example sections for details.
%C A325775 All the nonnegative integers will appear in this sequence, except the terms of A308306.
%C A325775 The "boomerang protocol" sends 1 to the left (as 1 is odd - the even digits move to the right), jumping over exactly 1 cell. To "bring back" 1 to its initial cell, the smallest integer is 102. Let's see how:
%C A325775 Our initial 1 starts for instance here (dots are cells):
%C A325775 ....1....
%C A325775 and ends there (S is the starting cell):
%C A325775 ..1.S....
%C A325775 We have this pattern now for the "bring back" integer (S is the new start, A is the Arrival cell we must reach - which was the starting cell of 1):
%C A325775 ..S.A....
%C A325775 The smallest integer starting on S and ending on A is 102:
%C A325775 ..1.A....
%C A325775 0...A....
%C A325775 .2..A....
%C A325775 We see that 1 jumps to the left over 1 cell, 0 to the right over 0 cell (thus moving to this cell), 2 jumps over 2 cells and lands precisely on the Arrival cell.
%C A325775 Note that many integers can "bring back" 1 in its initial cell, 120 is one of them, for instance, or 1410.

%e A325775 The sequence starts with 102,25,20,27,22,29,24,90,... We see that:
%e A325775 a(1) = 102 means that 102 will bring 1 back in its initial cell;
%e A325775 a(2) = 25 means that 25 will bring 2 back in its initial cell;
%e A325775 a(3) = 20 means that 20 will bring 3 back in its initial cell;
%e A325775 a(4) = 27 means that 27 will bring 4 back in its initial cell;
%e A325775 a(5) = 22 means that 22 will bring 5 back in its initial cell;
%e A325775 The general formula being that a(n) brings back (n) in its initial cell.
%e A325775 a(100) = -1 means that 100 is a "boomerang number": it "comes back" by itself without any external help. Those numbers are listed in A308306.
%Y A325775 Cf. A308306 (the "boomerang numbers") and A325776 where duplicate terms are admitted.
