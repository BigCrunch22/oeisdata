%N A325112 Integers k such that no nonzero subsequence of the decimal representation of k is divisible by 3.
%C A325112 Integers whose decimal representation contains either just one nonzero digit, which is congruent to 1 or 2 (mod 3), or just two nonzero digits, which are either both == 1 (mod 3) or both == 2 (mod 3). - _Robert Israel_, Dec 25 2019

%e A325112 From _David A. Corneth_, Sep 09 2024: (Start) 404 is in the sequence as its nonzero digits are (4,4). The nonzero subsequences of digits are (), (4), (4,4) with respective sums 0, 4, 8. None of these subsequences have a sum that is divisible by 3.
%e A325112 4160 is not in the sequence as one of its nonzero subsequences is (6) which sums to 6. As 6 is divisible by 3, 4160 is not in the sequence. (End)
