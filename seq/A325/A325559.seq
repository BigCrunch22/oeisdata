%N A325559 Numbers n such that for any divisor d of n, and some integer k, A048720(d,k) = n only for trivial cases d=1 and d=n.
%C A325559 These are numbers n such that there are only two divisor pairs (d, n/d) [namely, the trivial pairs (1, n) and (n, 1)] that satisfy the condition that when their binary expansions are converted to (0,1)-polynomials (e.g., 13=1101[2] encodes X^3 + X^2 + 1), then their product is the (0,1)-polynomial similarly converted from n, when the multiplication is done over field GF(2).
%C A325559 Differs from A206074 for the first time at n=173, where a(173) = 555, a value missing from A206074, while the first three terms of A206074 not present in this sequence are k = 689, 781 and 913, for all of which A325560(k) = 3, not 2.
