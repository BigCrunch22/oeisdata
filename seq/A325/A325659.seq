%N A325659 Smallest Brazilian composite in base n >= 2 which can be represented as a string of three or more 1's in this base.
%C A325659 Also the smallest Brazilian composite of the form (n^k - 1)/(n - 1) with k > 2.
%C A325659 For Mersenne numbers = (11...11)_2 = 2^k-1 in A000225, there is a smaller integer which is Brazilian prime: 7, so 7 is the first term of A285642 and another one is the smaller composite 15, so 15 is the first term of this sequence.
%C A325659 For numbers (11...11)_3 = (3^k-1)/2 in A003462,  there is also a smaller integer which is Brazilian prime:13, so 13 is the second term of A285642 and another one is the smaller Brazilian composite: 40, so 40 is the second term of this sequence.
%C A325659 For numbers like (11...11)_4 = (4^k-1)/3, the terms are respectively 0 in A285642 because there is no Brazilian prime of this type and 21 for composite numbers of this sequence, and so on.
