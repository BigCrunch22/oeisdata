%N A325206 a(n) is the number of labeled rooted trees on a set of size n where each node has at most 7 neighbors that are further away from the root than the node itself.
%C A325206 A preimage constraint on a function is a set of nonnegative integers such that the size of the inverse image of any element is one of the values in that set. View a labeled rooted tree as an endofunction on the set {1,2,...,n} by sending every non-root node to its neighbor that is closer to the root and sending the root to itself. Thus, a(n) is the number of endofunctions on a set of size n with exactly one cyclic point and such that each preimage has at most 7 entries.

%F A325206 a(n) = (n-1)! * [x^(n-1)] e_7(x)^n, where e_k(x) is the truncated exponential 1 + x + x^2/2! + ... + x^k/k!. The link above yields explicit constants c_k, r_k so that the columns are asymptotically c_7 * n^(-3/2) * r_7^-n.
