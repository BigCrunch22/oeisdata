%N A325753 Triangle read by rows giving the number of configurations of n indistinguishable pairs placed on the vertices of the ladder graph P_2 X P_n such that exactly k such pairs are joined by an edge.
%C A325753 This is the number of "k-domino" configurations in the game of memory played on a 2 X n rectangular array, see [Young]. First column is A265167, second column is A318244. Diagonals are given by A000045, A178523, A318267, A318268, A318269, A318270.

%e A325753 The first few rows of T(n,k) are:
%e A325753    1;

%e A325753   21, 34, 39,  6, 5;
%e A325753   ...
%e A325753 For n = 2 there is only one way to place the two pairs such that neither is joined by an edge, hence T(2,0)=1. If one pair is joined by an edge, the other is forced to be, hence T(2,1) = 0, and since the pairs can be joined horizontally or vertically T(2,2) = 2.
