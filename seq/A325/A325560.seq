%N A325560 a(n) is the number of divisors d of n such that A048720(d,k) = n for some k.
%C A325560 a(n) is the number of divisors d of n such that when the binary expansion of d is converted to a (0,1)-polynomial (e.g., 13=1101[2] encodes X^3 + X^2 + 1), that polynomial is a divisor of the (0,1)-polynomial similarly converted from n, when the polynomial division is done over field GF(2).

%e A325560 39 = 3*13 has four divisors 1, 3, 13, 39, of which all other divisors except 13 are counted because we have A048720(1,39) = A048720(39,1) = A048720(3,29) = 39, but A048720(13,u) is not equal to 39 for any u, thus a(39) = 3. See also the example in A325563.
