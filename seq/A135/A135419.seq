%N A135419 Array read by rows, showing the ways of splitting the numbers from 1 to 16 into two groups so that the numbers in each group have the same sum (68) and the same sum of squares (748).

%e A135419 There are exactly 657 ways of splitting the numbers 1..16 into two groups so that the numbers in each group have the same sum s1=68.
%e A135419 There are exactly 57 ways of splitting the numbers 1..16 into two groups so that the numbers in each group have the same sum of squares s2=748.
%e A135419 And there is the only one way of splitting the numbers 1..16 into two groups so that the numbers in each group have the same sum of cubes s3=9248: {{1, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 16} (=A133483) and {2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 12, 14, 15} (=A133484)}.
%e A135419 Amazingly, this last way also appears in previous two cases! This is given in A133483 and A133484.
%e A135419 (Also, there is the only one way of splitting the numbers 1..16 into two groups so that the numbers in each group have the same sum of fourth powers s4=121924: {{1,2,3,4,8,9,10,11,12,16},{5,6,7,13,14,15}}. But this splitting does not give equal sum of powers 1..3.)
%e A135419 Intersection of first two cases gives 12 ways of splitting the numbers 1..16 into two groups so that the numbers in each group have the same sum s1=68 and the same sum of squares s2=748;
%e A135419 Here we list only groups containing 1 (the corresponding 2nd groups are their complements):
