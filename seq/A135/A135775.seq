%N A135775 Numbers having number of divisors equal to number of digits in base 5.
%C A135775 Since 5 is a prime, any power 5^k has k+1 divisors { 5^i ; i=0..k } and the same number of digits in base 5; thus the sequence A000351(k)=5^k is a subsequence of this one. It also includes the powers of 7 up to 7^4, since (7/5)^4 < 5 < (7/5)^5.

%e A135775 a(1) = 1 since 1 has 1 divisor and 1 digit (in base 5).
%e A135775 2,3,4 have 2 resp. 3 divisors but only 1 digit in base 5, so they are not members of the sequence.
%e A135775 a(2) = 5 = 10_5 has 2 divisors { 1, 5 } and 2 digits in base 5, so it is (the second term) in this sequence.
