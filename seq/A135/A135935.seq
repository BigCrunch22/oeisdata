%N A135935 Decimal expansion of the starting value b(0) such that the fractional part of the sequence b(n+1) = b(n) + tanh(b(n)) approaches zero as n -> infinity.
%C A135935 Starting from some b(0), the sequence b(n) satisfies b(n+1)=b(n)+1 as n->infinity, so the fractional part approaches some constant.
%C A135935 With b(0) = 0.639.., this constant here, the fractional value b(n)-floor(b(n)) converges to 0 (equivalent to 0.999999..) as n->infinity.
