%N A135436 a(n) is the least prime for which the n-th term of the sequence S(a(n)) belongs to A007500, where each term of S(p) is the least prime >= the reversal of the previous term.
%C A135436 After a term of A007500 has appeared in S(p), either this number, if it's truly palindromic, or the pair constituted by it and its reversal, is repeated indefinitely.
%C A135436 For all primes <= 189989, a term of A007500 appears always in S(p) but I could not go further as in the sequence S(p) of the next prime appears a term > 10^6 which is beyond my capacities of calculation. Anyway it's not a surprise and very probably all sequences S(p) reach a stability in a finite limit. What is more surprising is that on the one hand the same term of A007500 appears in sequence S(n) for a(13) and a(14) and on the other hand another same term of A007500 appears in these sequences for a(16), a(17), a(18) and a(19).
%e A135436 The sequence S(223) is 223, 331, 137, 733 = A007500(38) and that is wrong for any prime lower than 223. Hence a(4)= 223.
%Y A135436 Cf. A007500.
