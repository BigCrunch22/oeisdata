%N A135872 Multiply the positive integers which are coprime to n in order (starting at 1). a(n) is the smallest such partial product that is >= n.
%e A135872 The positive integers which are coprime to 9 begin: 1,2,4,5,7,8,10,11,... Checking the partial products: 1=1, 1*2=2, 1*2*4 = 8, 1*2*4*5 =40,... 40 is the smallest such partial product which is >= 9. So a(9) = 40.
