%e A135615 The divisors of 5 are (1,5). The divisors of 6 are (1,2,3,6). And the divisors of 7 are (1,7). Looking at the divisors of 6, 1 is the average of 1 (from the divisors of 5) and 1 (from the divisors of 7). 3 is the average of 5 (from the divisors of 5) and 1 (from the divisors of 7). And 6 is the average of 5 (from the divisors of 5) and 7 (from the divisors of 7). 2 is not the average of any divisor of 5 and any divisor of 7. There are 3 divisors of 6 that are such averages, so a(5) = 3.
