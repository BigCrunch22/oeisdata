%N A135509 Nonnegative integers c such that there are nonnegative integers a and b that satisfy a^(1/2) + b^(1/2) = c^(1/2) and a^2 + b = c.
%C A135509 Define FLTR as Fermat's Last Theorem with rational exponents. Consider x + y = x + y. Then (x^m)^(1/m) + (y^m)^(1/m) = ((x+y)^m)^(1/m) for integer m >= 1.
%C A135509 For m = 2, we have (x^2)^(1/2) + (y^2)^(1/2) = ((x+y)^2)^(1/2). Thus, a = x^2, b = y^2 and c = (x+y)^2. Then a^2 + b = c => x^4 + y^2 = (x+y)^2 => x^4 + y^2 = x^2 + 2*x*y + y^2 => y = (x^3-x)/2. It follows that c = (x+y)^2 = (x^3 + x)^2/4 is the generating function for this sequence for x = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
%C A135509 For m = 2, there are infinitely many nonnegative integer solutions for the FLTR proposition. The same holds for m = 3, i.e., there are also infinitely many nonnegative integer solutions to a^(1/3) + b^(1/3) = c^(1/3). E.g., 8^(1/3) + 27^(1/3) = 125^(1/3). Moreover, there are infinitely many solutions to FLTR for a general positive integer m.
%C A135509 However, in conjunction with a^2 + b = c, I could not find any nontrivial solutions when m >= 3. Perhaps there is another formula that will yield solutions. [Edited by _Petros Hadjicostas_, Dec 21 2019]

%e A135509 For a = 9, b = 144, and c = 225, we obtain 9^(1/2) + 144^(1/2) = 225^(1/2) and 9^2 + 144 = 225. Thus, c = 225 is an entry in this sequence.
