%N A135047 Initial members of an octuplet of generalized Fermat primes: numbers n such that (n+m)^4+1 is prime for m=0,2,4,6,8,10,12 and 14.
%C A135047 n^4+1 can be prime for at most eight consecutive even numbers n, otherwise at least one member would be divisible by 17.
%e A135047 a(1)=10332305196 because 103323051964^4+1 is prime and (10332305196+m)^4+1 is prime for all even m up to 14.
