%N A135952 Prime factors of composite Fibonacci numbers with prime indices (cf. A050937).
%C A135952 All numbers in this sequence are congruent to 1 mod 4. - _Max Alekseyev_.
%C A135952 If Fibonacci(n) is divisible by a prime p of the form 4k+3 then n is even. To prove this statement it is enough to show that (1+sqrt(5))/(1-sqrt(5)) is never a square modulo such p (which is a straightforward exercise).
%C A135952 The n-th prime p is an element of this sequence iff A001602(n) is prime and A051694(n)=A000045(A001602(n))>p. - _Max Alekseyev_
