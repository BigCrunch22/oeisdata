%N A135814 Triangle of numbers of coincidence-free length n-m lists of m-tuples with all numbers 1,...,n-m in tuple position k, for k=1..m.
%C A135814 The column sequences (without leading zeros) give A000007, A000166 (subfactorials), A089041, A135809 - A135813, for m=0..7.
%C A135814 a(n,m), n >= m, enumerates (ordered) length n-m lists of m-tuples such that every number from 1 to n-m appears once at each of the n-m tuple positions and the j-th list member is not the tuple (j,j,...,j) (m times j), for every j=1,...,n-m. Called coincidence-free m-tuple lists of length n-m. See the Charalambides reference for this combinatorial interpretation.

%e A135814 The a(5,3)=7 lists of length 5-3=2 with coincidence-free 3-tuples are [(1,1,2),(2,2,1)], [(1,2,1),(2,1,2)], [(2,1,1),(1,2,2)], [(1,2,2),(2,1,1)], [(2,1,2),(1,2,1)], [(2,2,1),(1,1,2)] and [(2,2,2),(1,1,1)]. The list [(1,1,1),(2,2,2)] is not coincidence-free because (1,1,1) appears at position 1 and also because (2,2,2) appears at position 2.
