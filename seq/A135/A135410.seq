%N A135410 Number of permutations of {1,2,3,...,n} each with the same up-down signature as its inverse permutation.
%C A135410 An "up-down signature" of the permutation (p(1),p(2),p(3),...,p(n)) is the sequence of (n-1) signs (+ or -) where the k-th sign in the sequence is the sign of (p(k+1)-p(k)). All permutations of {1,2,3,...,n} which are their own inverses obviously have the same up-down signature as their inverse permutations.
%C A135410 The terms were calculated by _R. J. Mathar_ (see link).
%H A135410 R. J. Mathar, <a href="/A135410/a135410.txt">C++ program</a>
%e A135410 The up-down signature of the permutation (4,2,6,3,5,1) is -+-+-. This permutation's inverse permutation is (6,2,4,1,5,3). The inverse permutation also has the up-down signature -+-+-. So these two permutations, among others, are included in the count for n = 6.
