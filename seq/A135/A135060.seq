%N A135060 a(n) is the smallest number m for which none of the first n multiples of m has twice as many divisors as m.
%C A135060 a(n) is smallest integer m such that A129902(m)/m > n.
%C A135060 Conjecture: every number in this sequence is also in A002182. [_J. Lowell_ disproved this conjecture at a(24) = 48188059920. - _Ray Chandler_]
%C A135060 The conjecture that every term is a multiple of the preceding term is disproved at n = 15; a(15) = 1081080, which is not a multiple of a(14) = 720720. - _J. Lowell_, Jun 06 2008

%e A135060 60 is not a(6) because 60 has 12 divisors and 60*6=360 has 12*2=24 divisors.
