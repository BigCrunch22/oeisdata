%N A135780 Squares such that another square can be obtained by a cyclic permutation of the digits, excluding leading zeros.
%C A135780 This is a subsequence of A034289.
%C A135780 It seems that there are never more than two squares having the same digits up to a cyclic permutation (checked up to (10^8)^2).

%e A135780 a(1) = 144 = 12^2 is the least square such that a cyclic permutation of its decimal digits is again a square, namely 441 = 21.
%e A135780 a(2) = 196 = 14^2 is the second least square having this property, with 961 = 19^2.
%e A135780 A034289(2)=169 does not figure here, since the permutations of its digits yielding squares are 196 and 961, which are not cyclic permutations of 169.
%e A135780 The number 25600 is here since 60025 is also a square.
%e A135780 The fact that 00256 also is a square is irrelevant: permutations with leading zeros are not considered.
