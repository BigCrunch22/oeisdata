%N A135357 Chord Progression graph substitution algorithm that give even odd on the p[7] tp p[6],but all twelve notes are covered: based on: C-> {F,G} is like D->{G,A} or 4->{9,11} is like 6->{11,1}.
%C A135357 It tends to repeat a lot and is not very interesting to the ear. If you start with {4,9,11} it doesn't alternate even-odd, but it also doesn't cover the twelve but misses {2,7} or Bb and Eb.
