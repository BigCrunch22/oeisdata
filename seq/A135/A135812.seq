%N A135812 Number of coincidence-free length n lists of 6-tuples with all numbers 1..n in tuple position k, for k=1..6.
%C A135812 a(n) enumerates (ordered) lists of n 6-tuples such that every number from 1 to n appears once at each of the six tuple positions and the j-th list member is not the tuple (j,j,j,j,j,j), for every j=1..n. Called coincidence-free 6-tuple lists of length n. See the Charalambides reference for this combinatorial interpretation.

%F A135812 a(n) = Sum_{j=0..n} ((-1)^(n-j))*binomial(n,j)*(j!)^6. See the Charalambides reference a(n)=B_{n,6}.
%e A135812 6-tuple combinatorics: a(1)=0 because the only list of 6-tuples composed of 1 is [(1,1,1,1,1,1)] and this is a coincidence for j=1.
%e A135812 6-tuple combinatorics: from the 2^6=64 possible 6-tuples of numbers 1 and 2 all except (1,1,1,1,1,1) appear as first members of the length 2 lists. The second members are the 6-tuples obtained by interchanging 1 and 2 in the first member. E.g. one of the a(2) = 2^6-1 = 63 lists is [(1,1,1,1,1,2),(2,2,2,2,2,1)]. The list [(1,1,1,1,1,1),(2,2,2,2,2,2)] does not qualify because it has in fact two coincidences, those for j=1 and j=2.
