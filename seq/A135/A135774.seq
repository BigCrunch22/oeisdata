%N A135774 Numbers having number of divisors equal to number of digits in base 4.
%C A135774 Since 4 is not a prime, no element > 1 of the sequence A000302(k)=4^k (having k+1 digits in base 4 but 2k+1 divisors) can be member of this sequence. However all powers of 5 up to 5^6 are in this sequence, having the same number of digits (in base 4) than the same power of 4 (since (5/4)^6 < 4 < (5/4)^7) and also that number of divisors.

%e A135774 a(1) = 1 since 1 has 1 divisor and 1 digit (in base 4 as in any other base).
%e A135774 a(2)..a(5) = 5, 7, 11, 13 are the primes (to have 2 divisors {1,p}) between 4 and 4^2 - 1 (to have 2 digits in base 4).
%e A135774 a(6), a(7) = 25, 49 are the squares of primes (3 divisors) between 4^2 = 100[4] and 4^3 - 1 = 333_4.
%e A135774 They are followed by all semiprimes and cubes of primes (4 divisors) between 4^3 and 4^4 - 1.
