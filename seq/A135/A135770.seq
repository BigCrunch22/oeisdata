%N A135770 Numbers whose square is such that another square can be obtained by a cyclic permutation of the digits (excluding leading zeros).
%C A135770 This is a subsequence of { sqrt(A034289(n)) }, or equivalently, { a(n)^2 } is a subsequence of A034289. Cf. A135780 for more remarks.
%F A135770 a(n)=sqrt(A135780(n))
%e A135770 a(1) = 12 since 12^2 = 144 is the least square such that a cyclic permutation of its decimal digits is again a square, namely 441 = 21^2. See A135780 for more explanations.
