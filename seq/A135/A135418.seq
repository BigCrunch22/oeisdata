%N A135418 Number of ways of splitting the numbers from 1 to 16 into two groups so that the numbers in each group have the same sum of n-th powers.
%C A135418 For n=1,2 there are numerous ways, while for each of n=3 and n=4 there is only one way: n=3:{1,4,6,7,10,11,13,16},{2,3,5,8,9,12,14,15} (see A133483-A133484), n=4: {1,2,3,4,8,9,10,11,12,16},{5,6,7,13,14,15}.
%C A135418 Presumably for n >= 4 there are no solutions.
%Y A135418 Cf. A133483, A133484, A135419.
