%N A135998 Smallest error in trying to solve n^3 = x^3 + y^3. That is, for each n, find positive integers x <= y < n such that | n^3 - x^3 - y^3 | is minimal and let a(n) := n^3 - x^3 - y^3.
%C A135998 a(n) is never zero, by Fermat's last theorem for cubes. There are infinitely many n for which a(n) = 1, -1 and 2. It is not known if a(n) is ever 3, besides a(5). By congruence considerations, a(n) is never +-4 mod 9. Presumably a(n) is roughly of order n.
%C A135998 The current definition leaves an abiguity when there is (x,y) and (x',y') that yield the same minimal difference but with opposite sign, e.g., for n = 994 or n = 1700, see examples. The sign of a(n) is currently not well defined in that case. - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 03 2024

%e A135998 a(7) = 2 because 7^3 - 5^3 - 6^3 = 2 and this can't be improved,
%e A135998 a(12) = -1 because 12^3 - 9^3 - 10^3 = -1 and this can't be improved.
%e A135998 From _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 03 2024: (Start)
%e A135998 a(994) = +- 1503 because 994^3 - 718^3 - 849^3 = 1503, 994^3 - 496^3 - 951^3 = -1503, and there is no smaller difference in absolute value.
%e A135998 a(1700) = +- 3375 because 1700^3 - 1070^3 - 1545^3 = 3375, 1700^3 - 719^3 - 1656^3 = -3375, and these are minimal in absolute value. (End)
