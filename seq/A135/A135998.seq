%N A135998 Smallest error in trying to solve n^3 = x^3 + y^3. That is, for each n, find positive integers x <= y < n such that | n^3 - x^3 - y^3 | is minimal and let a(n) := n^3 - x^3 - y^3.
%C A135998 a(n) is never zero, by Fermat's last theorem for cubes. There are infinitely many n for which a(n)=1,-1 and 2. It is not known if a(n) is ever 3, besides a(5). By congruence considerations, a(n) is never +-4 mod 9. Presumably a(n) is roughly of order n.

%e A135998 a(7) = 2 because 7^3 - 5^3 - 6^3 = 2 and this can't be improved,
%e A135998 a(12) = -1 because 12^3 - 9^3 - 10^3 = -1 and this can't be improved.
