%C A135435 Of interest because {7,11} is the earliest pair of typical primes belonging to a single hexad. Herein "pseudoprime" means sequence-specific psp. (i.e. dividing its term with rem. 0), not general number-theoretic psp. The only psp.s of concern, from the standpoint of primality testing, being those congruent to 1 or 5 (mod 6), are the six quadratics of the present zero-termed primes 5,13,17 the only relevant psp.s of this sequence? Or are there additional examples > 289?
