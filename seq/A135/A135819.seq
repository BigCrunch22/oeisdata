%N A135819 Moves for edge 3-cycle (uf,ul,ur) in a 3 X 3 X 3 Rubik's Cube.
%C A135819 r,l,u,d,f,b are respectively right, left, up, down, front, back faces of a 3 X 3 X 3 Rubik's Cube. Set M=2, R=3, L=5, U=7, D=11, F=13, B=17, where M is a 90-degree turn of the middle slice of Rubik's Cube; R is a 90-degree turn of the right face, L is a 90-degree turn of the left face... The moves for edge 3-cycle (uf,ul,ur) are (M^2*U^3)*(M^3*U^2)*(M*U^3)*M^2 = (2^2*7^3)*(2^3*7^2)*(2*7^3)*2^2 = 1372*392*686*4. Note that as the order of a 90-degree turn T is 4, then T^2 = T^-2 and T^3 = T^-1. Moves adapted from 'Adventures in group theory', D. Joyner, J. Hopkins Press.
%C A135819 441,441,441 are the moves to permute (uf,ub)(fr,br) edges in a 3 X 3 X 3 Rubik's Cube.
%C A135819 14,14,14,14 are the moves to flip ub,ul edges and to flip df,db edges in a 3 X 3 X 3 Rubik's Cube.
%e A135819 1372 = 2^2*7^3 codes M^2*U^3 moves.
