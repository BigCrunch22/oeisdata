%N A135773 Numbers having number of divisors equal to number of digits in base 3.
%C A135773 Since 3 is a prime, any power 3^k has k+1 divisors { 3^i ; i=0..k } and the same number of digits in base 3; thus the sequence A000244(k) = 3^k is a subsequence of this one. Note that no number in between 3^4 and 3^5, neither in between 3^6 and 3^7, is in this sequence.

%e A135773 a(1) = 1 since 1 has 1 divisor and 1 digit (in base 3).
%e A135773 2 has 2 divisors but only 1 digit in base 3, so it is not member of the sequence.
%e A135773 a(2)..a(4) = 3, 5, 7 all have 2 divisors and 2 digits in base 3.
%e A135773 81 = 3^4 = 10000_3 is the only number with 5 divisors and 5 digits in base 3, so it is followed by 243 = 3^5 = 100000_3.
