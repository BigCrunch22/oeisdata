%N A135810 Number of coincidence-free length n lists of 4-tuples with all numbers 1..n in tuple position k, for k=1..4.
%C A135810 a(n) enumerates (ordered) lists of n 4-tuples such that every number from 1 to n appears once at each of the four tuple positions and the j-th list member is not the tuple (j,j,j,j), for every j=1..n. Called coincidence-free 4-tuple lists of length n. See the Charalambides reference for this combinatorial interpretation.

%H A135810 G. C. Greubel, <a href="/A135810/b135810.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..143</a>
%F A135810 a(n) = Sum_{j=0..n} ( ((-1)^(n-j))*binomial(n,j)*(j!)^4 ). See the Charalambides reference a(n) = B_{n,4}.
%e A135810 4-tuple combinatorics: a(1)=0 because the only list of 4-tuples composed of 1 is [(1,1,1,1)] and this is a coincidence for j=1.
%e A135810 4-tuple combinatorics: from the 2^4 possible 4-tuples of numbers 1 and 2 all except (1,1,1,1) appear as first members of the length 2 lists. The second members are the 4-tuples obtained by interchanging 1 and 2. E.g., one of the a(2)=15 lists is [(1,1,1,2),(2,2,2,1)]. The list [(1,1,1,1),(2,2,2,2)] does not qualify because it has in fact two coincidences, those for j=1 and j=2.
