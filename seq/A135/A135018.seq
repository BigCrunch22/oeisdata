%N A135018 Triangle read by rows: row 1 = {1}, row 2 = {1,2}. Row n consists of the smallest n distinct positive integers such that no term in row (n-1) is the average of a term in row (n-2) and a term in row n.

%e A135018 Look at row 3 (2,4,5) and row 5 (1,2,7,9,10). The averages of the terms in row 3 with the terms of row 5 are: (2+1)/2 = 1.5, (2+2)/2=2, (2+7)/2=4.5; and continuing, the averages are: 5.5, 6, (4+1)/2= 2.5, 3, 5.5, 6.5, 7, (5+1)/2=3, 3.5, 6, 7, 7.5. None of these averages occur among the terms of row 4 (1,4,5,10). In fact, the terms of row 5 are the smallest 5 distinct positive integers such that the averages with the terms of row 3 do not equal any of the terms of row 4.
