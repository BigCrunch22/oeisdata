%N A135776 Numbers having number of divisors equal to number of digits in base 6.
%C A135776 Since 6 is not a prime, no element > 1 of the sequence A000400(k)=6^k (having k+1 digits in base 6, but much more divisors) can be a member of this sequence. However, all powers of 7 up to 7^11 are in this sequence, having the same number of digits (in base 6) as the same power of 6 (since 11 = floor(log(7/6)/log(6))) and also that number of divisors (since 7 is prime).

%e A135776 a(1) = 1 since 1 has 1 divisor and 1 digit (in base 6 as in any other base).
%e A135776 They are followed by the primes (having 2 divisors {1,p}) between 6 and 6^2 - 1 (to have 2 digits in base 6).
%e A135776 Then come the squares of primes (3 divisors) between 6^2 = 100_6 and 6^3 - 1 = 555_6.
%e A135776 These are followed by all semiprimes and cubes of primes (4 divisors) between 6^3 and 6^4 - 1.
