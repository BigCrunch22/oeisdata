%N A135827 Moves for corner 3-cycles (brd,urb,ulb) in a 3 X 3 X 3 Rubik's Cube.
%C A135827 r,l,u,d,f,b are respectively right, left, up, down, front, back faces of a 3 X 3 X 3 Rubik's Cube. Set M=2, R=3, L=5, U=7, D=11, F=13, B=17, where M is a 90-degree turn of the middle slice of Rubik's Cube; R is a 90-degree turn of the right face, L is a 90-degree turn of the left face... The moves for corner 3-cycles (brd,urb,ulb) are (R*D)*(R^3*U)*(R* D^3)*(R^3*U^3) = (3*11)*(3^3*7)*(3*11^3)*(3^3*7^3) = 33*189*3993*9261. Note that as the order of a 90-degree turn T is 4, then T^2 = T^-2 and T^3 = T^-1. Moves adapted from 'Adventures in group theory', D. Joyner, J. Hopkins Press.
