%N A135670 Triangular sequence of the coefficients of the denominator of the rational recursive sequence for tan(n*x).
%C A135670 These are the denominators of the expansion of tan(n*x) as in A034839, but keeping the zeros with the terms in the denominator polynomials that vanish. Sign conventions differ slightly, maintaining either a positive coefficient [x^0], or a positive coefficient [x^n] or [x^(n-1)], resp.
