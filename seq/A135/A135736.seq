%N A135736 Nearest integer to n*Sum_{k=1..n} 1/k = rounded expected coupon collection numbers.
%C A135736 Somewhat more realistic than A052488 but more optimistic than A060293, the expected number of boxes that must be bought to get the full collection of N objects, if each box contains any one of them at random. See also comments in A060293, A052488.
%H A135736 Adam Hugill, <a href="/A135736/b135736.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 0..10000</a> (terms 0..999 from G. C. Greubel)
%F A135736 a(n) = round(n*A001008(n)/A002805(n)) = either A052488(n) or A060293(n).
%F A135736 a(n) ~ A060293(n) ~ A052488(n) ~ A050502(n) ~ A050503(n) ~ A050504(n) (asymptotically)
%F A135736 Conjecture: a(n) = round(n*(log(n) + gamma) + 1/2) for n > 0, where gamma = A001620. - _Ilya Gutkovskiy_, Oct 31 2016
%F A135736 The conjecture is false: a(2416101) = 36905656 while round(2416101*(log(2416101) + gamma) + 1/2) = 36905657, with the unrounded numbers being 36905656.499999982... and 36905656.500000016.... Heuristically this should happen infinitely often. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Oct 31 2016
%e A135736 a(0) = 0 since nothing needs to be bought if nothing is to be collected.
%e A135736 a(1) = 1 since only 1 box needs to be bought if only 1 object is to be collected.
%e A135736 a(2) = 3 since the chance of getting the other object at the second purchase is only 1/2, so it takes 2 boxes on the average to get it.
%e A135736 a(3) = 6 since the chance of getting a new object at the second purchase is 2/3 so it takes 3/2 boxes in the mean, then the chance becomes 1/3 to get the 3rd, i.e., 3 other boxes on the average to get the full collection and the rounded value of 1 + 3/2 + 3 = 11/2 = 5.5 is 6.
