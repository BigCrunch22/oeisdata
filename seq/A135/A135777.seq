%N A135777 Numbers having number of divisors equal to number of digits in base 7.
%C A135777 Since 7 is a prime, any power 7^k has k+1 divisors { 7^i ; i=0..k } and the same number of digits in base 7; thus the sequence A000420(k)=7^k is a subsequence of this one.

%e A135777 a(1) = 1 since 1 has 1 divisor and 1 digit (in base 7 as in any other base).
%e A135777 All other numbers have at least 2 divisors so there are no other members of the sequence below a(2) = 7 = 10_7 having 2 divisors { 1, 7 } and 2 digits in base 7.
