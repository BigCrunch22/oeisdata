%N A275121 a(n) is the smallest multiple of n that is a practical number.
%C A275121 A rational in (0,1) as a fraction in lowest terms with denominator n, if expressed with denominator a(n) will have a practical-number denominator and can be written as an Egyptian fraction.
%C A275121 Note that a(n) exists for each n; a trivial upper bound is n * gpf(n)# = n * A034386(A006530(n)). - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jul 25 2016

%F A275121 a(n) = n * A210445(n).
%e A275121 For example a(5)=20, indicating that a fraction with denominator 5 can be rewritten as a fraction with denominator 20, which is a practical number. Thus a fraction such as 4/5 can be written as 16/20. The new numerator 16 can be written as the sum of distinct divisors of 20 (16=10+5+1) because 20 is a practical number. The fractions 10/20, 5/20, and 1/20 are each a reciprocal: 1/2, 1/4, and 1/20. Thus 4/5 can be written as the sum of distinct reciprocals (Egyptian fraction expansion) as 4/5 = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/20.
