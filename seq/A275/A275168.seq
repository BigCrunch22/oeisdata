%N A275168 Positive integers not of the form x^3 + 3*y^2 + z^2 with x,y,z nonnegative integers.
%C A275168 Conjecture: The sequence has totally 150 terms as listed in the b-file the largest of which is 182842. Thus any integer n > 182842 can be written as x^3 + 3*y^2 + z^2 with x,y,z nonnegative integers.
%C A275168 We note that the sequence has no term greater than 182842 and not exceeding 10^6.
%C A275168 See also A275169 for a similar conjecture.
%C A275168 It is known that for any positive integers a,b,c there are infinitely many positive integers not of the form a*x^2 + b*y^2 + c*z^2 with x,y,z nonnegative integers.

%e A275168 a(1) = 6 since 1 = 0^3 + 3*0^2 + 1^2, 2 = 1^3 + 3*0^2 + 1^2, 3 = 0^3 + 3*1^2 + 0^2, 4 = 0^3 + 3*1^2 + 1^2, 5 = 1^3 + 3*1^2 + 1^2, but 6 cannot be written as x^3 + 3*y^2 + z^2 with x,y,z nonnegative integers.
