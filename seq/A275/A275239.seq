%N A275239 Highly composite numbers of class 1 (see comment).
%C A275239 Consider the sequence of highly composite  numbers (HCN) (A002182). Let us say that its terms are HCN of class 0. Removing A002182 from the positive integers we obtain the sequence 3,5,7,8,9,10,11,13,14,15,16,17,18,...(1)
%C A275239 Consider the subsequence whose number of divisors set a record. We obtain 3,8,16,18,... We call this sequence HCN of class 1. It is A275239.
%C A275239 Furthermore, removing from sequence (1) the HCN of class 1 we obtain the sequence 5,7,9,10,11,13,14,15,17,19,20,21,... (2)
%C A275239 Again consider the subsequence whose number of divisors are records. We obtain 5,9,10,20,... We call this sequence HCN of class 2. It is A275240, etc.
%C A275239 Note that the sequence of HCN of class h>=1 numbers begins from Prime(h+1)(which is the unique prime in the sequence).
