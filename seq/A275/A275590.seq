%N A275590 When written in English, the terms of the sequence with an odd number of letters form blocks whose sizes are given by the sequence itself.
%C A275590 The sequence is started with a(1) = "ONE" and always extended with the smallest integer not yet used whose name in English does not lead to a contradiction.
%C A275590 The sequence is a permutation of the natural numbers.
%C A275590 The convention adopted here is to write the English number-names like "101" as ONE HUNDRED ONE and not ONE HUNDRED AND ONE (which would have produced a different sequence).

%e A275590 The blocks of "odd-words" are written in UPPER CASE letters and enclosed in parentheses; the successive block-sizes are 1, 4, 2, 3, 6, 7, ... which reproduces the sequence itself:
