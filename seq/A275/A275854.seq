%N A275854 Number of labeled directed graphs on n nodes (allowing self loops) such that the out-degree of each node is at most 2.
%C A275854 As n goes to infinity, the probability that a node in such a graph has in-degree = 0 is 1/e^2.  More generally, for 0<=k<=n, the probability that a node has in-degree = 0 in such a graph where the out-degree is restricted to be at most k is 1/e^k.  Cf. A000169 where k=1 (partial functions) and A002416 where k=n.
%F A275854 a(n) = (Sum_{j=0..2} binomial(n,j))^n.
%F A275854 More generally, the number of labeled digraphs on n nodes with out-degree restricted to be at most k, 0<=k<=n, is given by: [Sum_{0<=j<=k} binomial(n,j)]^n.
%F A275854 From _Ilya Gutkovskiy_, Aug 11 2016: (Start)
%F A275854 a(n) = 2^(-n)*(n^2 + n + 2)^n.
%F A275854 a(n) = A000124(n)^n. (End)
