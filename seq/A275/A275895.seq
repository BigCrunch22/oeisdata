%N A275895 "Greedy Queens" permutation of the nonnegative integers.
%C A275895 This permutation is produced by a simple greedy algorithm: starting from the top left corner of an infinite chessboard placed in the fourth quadrant of the plane, walk along successive antidiagonals and place a queen in the first available position where it is not threatened by any of the existing queens. In other words, this permutation satisfies the condition that p(i+d) <> p(i)+-d for all i and d >= 1.
%C A275895 The rows and columns are indexed starting at 0. p(n) = k means that a queen appears in column n in row k. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Aug 18 2016
%C A275895 All of A065188 (same for positive integers), A065189, A199134, A275884 should really have started at 0 rather than 1. Then the graph of A065188, for example, would be comparable with the graph of A002251.
%C A275895 That this is a permutation of the nonnegative integers follows from the proof in A269526 that every row and every column in that array is a permutation of the positive integers. In particular, every row and every column contains a 0 (which translates to a queen in the present sequence). - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 10 2017
