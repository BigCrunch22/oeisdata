%N A275482 The sum of the last digit of a(n) and the first digit of a(n+1) is a divisor of a(n) and a(n+1) concatenated.
%C A275482 Start the sequence with a(1)=1 and always extend it with the smallest integer not yet present in the sequence that does not lead to a contradiction.
%C A275482 It is conjectured that this sequence is a permutation of the nonnegative numbers.

%e A275482 a(1) = 1.
%e A275482 a(2) = 2 because (1+2) is a divisor of 12 (as 12/3 = 4).
%e A275482 The next term can't be "3" as (2+3)=5 and 5 is not a divisor of 23.
%e A275482 The next term is 4 because (2+4) is a divisor of 24 (as 24/6 = 4).
%e A275482 The next term can't be "3" as (4+3)=7 and 7 is not a divisor of 43.
%e A275482 The next term is 5 because (4+5) is a divisor of 45 (as 45/9 = 5).
%e A275482 The next term still can't be "3" as (5+3)=8 and 8 is not a divisor of 53.
%e A275482 The next term can't be "6" as (5+6)=11 and 11 is not a divisor of 56.
%e A275482 The next term can't be "7" as (5+7)=12 and 12 is not a divisor of 57.
%e A275482 The next term can't be "8" as (5+8)=13 and 13 is not a divisor of 58.
%e A275482 The next term can't be "9" as (5+9)=14 and 14 is not a divisor of 59.
%e A275482 The next term is 10 because (5+1) is a divisor of 510 (as 510/6 = 85).
