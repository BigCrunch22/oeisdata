%N A275413 a(0)=0 and a(n) is the smallest available integer not yet present in the sequence that starts with the last digit of a(n-1) augmented by 1.
%C A275413 The sequence is a permutation of the nonnegative integers A001477.
%e A275413 After [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] the next term must start with [0+1 = 1]; as 1 and 10 are already in the sequence, “11”, the smallest available integer, is chosen. The next term must start with [1+1 = 2]; as 2 is already in the sequence, “20” is chosen. The next term must start with [0+1 = 1]; as 1, 10 and 11 are already in the sequence, “12” is chosen. Etc.
