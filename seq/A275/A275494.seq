%N A275494 Number of primitive weird numbers (A002975) between 2^n and 2^(n+1).
%C A275494 It is not known unconditionally whether there are infinitely many primitive weird numbers (PWN, A002975), although numerical data provides strong evidence: even the number of weird numbers of the form 2^k*p*q (A258882, A258333) seems to increase rapidly as k increases. Melfi has shown that Cramer's conjecture implies the infiniteness of PWN.

%F A275494 a(n) = A275493(n+1) - A275493(n).
%e A275494 The first primitive weird numbers are 70, 836, 4030, 5830, 7192, 7912, 9272, 10792, ..., so there is one between 2^6 and 2^7 = 128, one between 2^9 and 2^10 = 1024, one between 2^11 and 2^12 = 4096, three between 2^12 and 2^13, etc.
