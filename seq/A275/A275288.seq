%C A275288 It appears that in most cases a(n) is a small multiple of n. For example: a(8)=3*8, a(11)=3*11, a(35)=1*35.
%C A275288 If not a small multiple of n, then a small rational times n.  For example: a(10)=3/2*10, a(21)=4/3*21, a(22)=3/2*22.
%C A275288 Conjectures:
%C A275288    a(2^n) = 3*n
%C A275288    a(3^n) = 2*n
%C A275288    a(5^n) = 4*n
%C A275288    a(6^n) = n

%C A275288 a(n) = n if and only if n is in A092671.
%C A275288 Every term in this sequence is in A092671.
%C A275288 a(a(n)) = a(n); that is, this sequence is idempotent.

%C A275288 For any n > 1, let P be the largest divisor of n that is either a prime (p) or prime power (p^e, where e > 1). Then a(n) >= m*P where m is the smallest integer such that p divides the numerator of the sum of some subset of the set of unit fractions {1/1, 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/m} that includes 1/(n/P).
%C A275288 Conjecture (confirmed for all n <= 40000): for all n > 1, the lower bound given above is tight, i.e., a(n) = m*P where m and P are as defined above. (See Example section.) (End)

%e A275288 For n=31, the largest prime or prime power divisor of n is P=31, and the set of unit fractions {1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6} has no subset sum that includes 1/(n/P) = 1/1 and has a numerator divisible by 31, but the set of unit fractions {1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/6, 1/7} does have such a subset sum, namely, 1/1 + 1/3 + 1/7 = 31/21, so a(31) >= 7*31 = 217. In fact, the numbers 1*31=31, 3*31=93, and 7*31=217 are elements of many sets of integers that include n=31, include no element > 217, and have a reciprocal sum of 1 (one such set is {2,3,12,28,31,93,217}), so a(31)=217.
%e A275288 For n=62, the largest prime or prime power divisor of n is again P=31, and the set of unit fractions {1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4} has no subset sum that includes 1/(n/P) = 1/2 and has a numerator divisible by 31, but the set of unit fractions {1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/5} does have such a subset sum, namely, 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5 = 31/30, so a(62) >= 5*31 = 155. In fact, the numbers 2*31=62, 3*31=93, and 5*31=155 are elements of many sets of integers that include n=62, include no element > 155, and have a reciprocal sum of 1 (one such set is {2,3,12,20,62,93,155}), so a(62)=155.
