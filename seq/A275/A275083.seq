%N A275083 Positive integers congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4 that cannot be written as x^3 + y^2 + z^2 with x,y,z nonnegative integers.
%C A275083 Conjecture: (i) The sequence has totally 18 terms as listed.
%C A275083 (ii) For each r = 2,3 there are infinitely many positive integers n == r (mod 4) not in the form x^3 + y^2 + z^2 with x,y,z nonnegative integers.
%C A275083 Our computation indicates that the sequence has no other terms below 10^6.
%C A275083 Let d be 2 or 6. Clearly, n-d is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4 if n is congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 4. So part (i) of the conjecture essentially implies that for each n = 0,1,2,... either n or n-d can be written as x^3 + y^2 + z^2 with x,y,z nonnegative integers.
%e A275083 a(1) = 120 since all those positive integers congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 4 and smaller than 120 can be written as x^3 + y^2 + z^2 with x,y,z nonnegative integers but 120 (divisible by 4) cannot be written in this way.
