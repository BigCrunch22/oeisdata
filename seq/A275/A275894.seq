%N A275894 a(n) = A275884(n+1) - 1.
%C A275894 A065188, A065189, A199134, and A275884 should really have started at 0 rather than 1. Then the graph of A065188, for example, would be comparable with the graph of A002251.
%C A275894 From _Michel Dekking_, Jun 24 2023: (Start)
%C A275894 It is the other way around: the sequence A002251 should have offset 1. This is very logical as the sequence A002251 is defined as the swapping of the sequences L = A000201, U = A001950, two sequences which both have offset 1.
%C A275894 The sequence A002251 already occurs in the OEIS with offset 1 as row 1 in sequence A054081.
