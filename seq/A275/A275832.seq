%F A275832 a(n) = A007814(A275725(n)).
%F A275832 Other identities:
%F A275832 For n >= 1, a(A033312(n)) = n.
%F A275832 For n >= 2, a(A000142(n)) = 1.
%e A275832 For n=0, the permutation with rank 0 in list A060118 is "1" (identity permutation) where 1 is fixed (in a 1-cycle), thus a(0)=1.
%e A275832 For n=1, the permutation with rank 1 in list A060118 is "21" where 1 is in a transposition (a 2-cycle), thus a(1)=2.
%e A275832 For n=3, the permutation with rank 3 in list A060118 is "231" where 1 is in a 3-cycle, thus a(3)=3.
%e A275832 For n=16, the permutation with rank 16 in list A060118 is "3412" (1 is in the other of two disjoint transpositions (1 3) and (2 4)), thus a(16)=2.
%e A275832 For n=44, the permutation with rank 44 in list A060118 is "43251", where 1 is a part of 3-cycle, thus a(44)=3.
