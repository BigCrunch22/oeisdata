%N A275303 Iterations at which Langton's Ant living on triangular tiling reaches the distance of n from the origin for the first time.
%C A275303 The distance is defined as the number of steps needed to reach the origin (analog of Manhattan distance).
%C A275303 a(n) ~ c*n^2; however, the first several hundreds of terms are very well described by the approximate formula c'*n^(2.8). [amended by _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Oct 09 2016 and Nov 02 2016]
