%N A275888 First differences of A275884.
%C A275888 Weak conjecture: a(n) <= 4. Does a 5 ever appear?
%C A275888 Suppose we think of (a(n)) as a sequence of words, each with exactly one 3, that 3 being at the end. Then, it becomes 113, 1113, 221113, 1113, 221211223, .... Empirical evidence suggests that there are exactly 156 possible words. These words range in length from 2 to 26, and all of them appear by n = 109000, with no new words showing up between n = 109000 and n = 618033989. Five of these 156 words contain a 4, and 63 of these words are faithful in the sense that they are always followed by a specific word, at least up to n = 618033989.
