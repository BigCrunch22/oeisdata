%N A275484 Denominators of Conway's FIBONACCIGAME.
%C A275484 Like PRIMEGAME, the object of FIBONACCIGAME is to come up with a listing of the Fibonacci numbers through a process of multiplying integers by fractions to see which produce integers, which are then cycled back through the process.
%C A275484 Notice that there isn't a 1 in this sequence, which means that the progress of the program, starting from a valid input, eventually halts with 2^Fibonacci(n).
