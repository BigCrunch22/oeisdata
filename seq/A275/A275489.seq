%N A275489 Most consecutive numbers that can be covered with arithmetic progressions of differences 2i+1, 1<=i<=n.
%C A275489 Erdos and Selfridge conjecture that there is no covering system whose moduli are distinct odd integers > 1. This is equivalent to saying that a(n) is finite for all n.

%e A275489 [1,2,3,4] can be covered by the arithmetic progressions 3k+1, 5k+2 and 7k+3 but [1,2,3,4,5] can't be covered by three arithmetic progressions with differences 3, 5 and 7, so  a(3) = 4.
