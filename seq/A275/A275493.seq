%N A275493 Number of primitive weird numbers (A002975) below 2^n.
%C A275493 It is not known unconditionally whether there are infinitely many primitive weird numbers (PWN, A002975), although numerical data provides strong evidence: even the number of weird numbers of the form 2^k*p*q (A258882, A258333) seems to increase rapidly as k increases. Melfi has shown that Cramer's conjecture implies the infiniteness of PWN.
