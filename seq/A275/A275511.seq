%N A275511 The a(n)th term of the sequence contains at least one digit "1".
%C A275511 The sequence starts with a(1)=1 and was always extended with the smallest integer not yet used that does not lead to a contradiction.
%e A275511 The 1st term (1) says that the 1st term contains at least a "1" -- indeed (it is 1)
%e A275511 The next term (3) says that the 3rd term contains at least a "1" -- indeed (it is 10)
%e A275511 The next term (10) says that the 10th term contains at least a "1" -- indeed (it is 14)
%e A275511 The next term (5) says that the 5th term contains at least a "1" -- indeed (it is 11)
%e A275511 The next term (11) says that the 11th term contains at least a "1" -- indeed (it is 15)
