%N A275305 Color of the cell Langton's Ant living on triangular tiling touches on its n-th step before the color is changed by the ant; 0=white, 1=black.
%C A275305 The ant starts from a completely white tiling.
%C A275305 There are never more than six 0's or 1's in a row because six identical turns will circle back into the same cell, which will have since changed.
