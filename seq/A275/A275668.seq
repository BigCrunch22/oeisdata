%N A275668 First occurrence of a value in A268755: a(i) = j iff A268755(j) = i-1 and A268755(j+1) = 0.
%C A275668 Observe that a value k can appear in A268755 only after 0,1,...,k-1 have already appeared. This means that this sequence is strictly increasing.
%C A275668 Conjectured to be infinite (this is equivalent to the conjecture that every positive integer eventually appears in A268755). (Proof given in comments of A268755).
%C A275668 How fast does it grow? Experimentally, it seems like a(n) ~ n^t, with 1 < t <= 2.
%H A275668 L치szl칩 Kozma, <a href="/A275668/b275668.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..1001</a>
%e A275668 For n = 4, a(4) = 10, since the value 3 first appears in A268755 at position 10.
%Y A275668 Cf. A268755, A181391.
