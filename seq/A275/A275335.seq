%N A275335 The primes in the sequence appear in blocks and the successive sizes of these blocks are given by the sequence itself.
%C A275335 This is the lexicographically first such sequence starting with a(1)=1 and being always extended with the smallest integer not yet present that doesn't lead to a contradiction.
%C A275335 The sequence is a permutation of the integers > 0.
