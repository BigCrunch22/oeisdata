%N A275513 The successive block-sizes of digits "1" in the sequence are given by the sequence itself.
%C A275513 The sequence starts with a(1)=1 and was always extended with the smallest integer not yet used that does not lead to a contradiction.
%e A275513 The blocks of digits "1" are indicated here by parentheses; the successive block-sizes are 1, 2, 3, 4,... which reproduces the sequence itself:
