%N A275119 The even integers in the sequence appear in blocks and the successive sizes of these blocks are given by the sequence itself.
%C A275119 The sequence starts with a(1)=1 and is always extended with the smallest integer not yet in the sequence which does not lead to a contradiction. The sequence is a permutation of the natural numbers.
