%N A275542 The digits of the integers with the nonprimes removed.
%C A275542 Write the digits of the positive integers one by one: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 6, 1, 7, 1, 8, 1, 9, 2, 0, 2, 1, etc. (this is A007376). Then from that sequence, remove the nonprimes, leaving a sequence that consists entirely of 2s, 3s, 5s and 7s.

%e A275542 From the single-digit numbers, we obviously get the first four terms of this sequence: 2, 3, 5, 7.
%e A275542 10 is composite and neither of its digits is a single-digit prime, so it contributes nothing to this sequence.
%e A275542 11 is prime but its digits consist of two 1s, so like 10 it also contributes nothing to the sequence.
%e A275542 12 is composite, but its least significant digit is 2, which is a prime, and thus 12 contributes a 2 to the sequence.
