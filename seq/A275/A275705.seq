%N A275705 A variation of the Zorach additive triangle, read by rows.
%C A275705 This is a variation of the Zorach additive triangle (A035312), with negative numbers included. Each term is the sum of the terms to its immediate west and northwest, and each member of the first column is chosen such that its absolute value is minimal and no term following it in its own row occurs earlier in the triangle. In the case where m and -m both satisfy these criteria for T(n,1) = |m|, choose the term that minimizes the absolute value of T(n,2).
%C A275705 Is this a permutation of the nonzero integers?
