%N A275376 The even digits in the sequence appear in blocks and the successive sizes of these blocks are given by the sequence itself.
%C A275376 This is the lexicographically first such sequence starting with a(1)=1 and being always extended with the smallest integer not yet present that doesn't lead to a contradiction.
