%N A275657 The prime digits in the sequence appear in blocks and the successive sizes of these blocks are given by the sequence itself.
%C A275657 The sequence is started with a(1)=1 and always extended with the smallest integer not yet present that does not lead to a contradiction.
%e A275657 The blocks of prime digits are indicated hereunder by parentheses; the successive block-sizes are 1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6,... which reproduces the sequence itself:
%e A275657 1,(2),4,(3,5),6,(7,22,2)0,8,9,10,11,1(2,23),1(3,25,27),14,1(5,32,33,2)1,16,...
%Y A275657 The equivalent sequence dealing with nonprime digits is A275659.
