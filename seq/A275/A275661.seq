%N A275661 a(1)=1. At any step consider the stream of 0's and 1's as two base-2 numbers: the first reading from left to right and the second from right to left. Sum the two numbers in base 2 and add them to the end of the sequence. Repeat.
%C A275661 Decimal values of string of bits generated at the n-th step: {1, 6, 105, 27060, 1773437055, 7616854156643735370, 140506159274377790195414803346835746325, ...}. - _Michael De Vlieger_, Sep 02 2016
%e A275661 First step: 1; the two numbers are obviously 1 and 1 which sum to 10; sequence becomes 1,1,0;
%e A275661 Second step: 1,1,0; the two numbers are 110 and 11, which sum to 1001; sequence becomes 1,1,0,1,0,0,1;
%e A275661 Third step: 1,1,0,1,0,0,1; the two numbers are 1101001 and 1001011, which sum to 10110100; sequence becomes 1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0; etc.
