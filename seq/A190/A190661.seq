%N A190661 a(n) is the least number m such that there are at least n primes in the range (T(k-1), T(k)] for all k >= m, where T(k) is the k-th triangular number.
%C A190661 All values and even whether the sequence is well defined are conjectural.
%C A190661 a(n) is the conjectured index of the last occurrence of n in A066888.
%C A190661 It is conjectured that for every n >= 0, a(n) > n.
%C A190661 With R_n the n-th Ramanujan prime (A104272), it is conjectured that for every n >= 0, (1/2) R_n <= a(n) < (20/13) R_n. These bounds have been verified for all n up to 8000. For most n <= 8000, we have a(n) > R_n, with exceptions listed in A190881.

%e A190661 Because it appears that A066888(7) = 1 is the last 1 of that sequence, a(1) = 7.
