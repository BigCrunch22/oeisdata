%N A190149 Even numbers n (written in binary) such that in base-2 lunar arithmetic, the sum of the divisors of n is a number containing a 0 (in binary).
%C A190149 As remarked in A188548, if n is even then most of the time A188548(n) = 111...111 (that is, a number of the form 2^k-1). This sequence lists the exceptions.
