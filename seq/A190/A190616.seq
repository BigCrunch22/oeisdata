%N A190616 Number of normal bases in GF(2^n) that are Gaussian normal bases.
%C A190616 A type-t Gaussian normal basis (GNB) exists for GF(2^n) if p=n*t+1 is prime and gcd(n,(p-1)/ord(2 mod p))==1.  In practice one finds (for fixed n) infinitely many t corresponding to some GNB.  As there are only finitely many normal bases for fixed n the GNBs for different t are not in general different but correspond to a finite set of field polynomials.  This sequence gives the number of field polynomials (equivalently, mod-2 reduced multiplication matrices) that correspond to some GNB.
%C A190616 The sequence was computed by determining all field polynomials for types t <= n*500 and discarding duplicate polynomials.  Note that there is no guarantee that the used bound (500*n) leads to discovery of all polynomials.
%C A190616 An efficient method to determine (for fixed n) whether two types, say t1 and t2, correspond to the same polynomial would be of great interest.
%C A190616 A computation using the bound t<=2000 gave a(22)=192 (the old value was 191), so the sequence was corrected past that term and truncated after a(29). [_Joerg Arndt_, May 16 2011]

%e A190616 For n=5 there is just one field polynomial (x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1),
