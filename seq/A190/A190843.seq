%C A190843 Suppose, in general, that a(n)=[(bn+c)r]-b[nr]-[cr].  If r>0 and b and c are integers satisfying b>=2 and 0<=c<=b-1, then 0<=a(n)<=b.  The positions of 0 in the sequence a are of interest, as are the position sequences for 1,2,...,b.  These b+1 (or b) position sequences comprise a partition of the positive integers.
