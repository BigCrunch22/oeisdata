%N A190843 a(n) = [2*n*e] - 2*[n*e], where [ ] = floor and e is the natural logarithm base.
%C A190843 Suppose, in general, that a(n) = [(b*n+c)r] - b*[n*r] - [c*r]. If r > 0 and b and c are integers satisfying b >= 2 and 0 <= c <= b-1, then 0 <= a(n) <= b. The positions of 0 in the sequence a are of interest, as are the position sequences for 1, 2, ..., b. These b+1 (or b) position sequences comprise a partition of the positive integers.
