%N A190911 Least number coprime to n and n+3.
%C A190911 This is to n+3 as A053670 is to n+1. This is the 3rd row of the array A(k,n) = Least number coprime to n and n+k where A053670 is the 1st row. First n for which a(n) = (3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ...) are A191112 = (1, 3, 12, 42, 165, 3000, 2142, ...).

%e A190911 a(12) = 7 because the prime factors of 12 and 12+3 = 15 are {2, 3, 5} and the next available prime is 7.
