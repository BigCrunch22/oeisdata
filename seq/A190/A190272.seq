%N A190272 Numbers n such that n' = a -1, with n and a semiprimes and gcd(a,n) > 1, where n' is the arithmetic derivative of n.
%C A190272 This sequence is infinite, assuming Dickson's conjecture. In fact, the conjecture implies that there are infinitely many terms of this sequence divisible by any fixed prime p. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, May 08 2011
%C A190272 Related to the Rassias Conjecture ("for any odd prime p there are primes q < r such that p*q = q+r+1") setting n = q*r, a = q+r+1. The sequence includes the cases with p = q (or p = r). Generalization can be achieved by removing the semiprimality condition or accepting gcd(n,a)=1. The differential equation in its general form n' = a + 1 includes Primary Pseudoperfect numbers, i.e., n' = n-1 (A054377).
