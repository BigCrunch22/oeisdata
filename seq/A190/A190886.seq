%N A190886 a(n) = [5nr]-5[nr], where r=sqrt(5).
%C A190886 In general, suppose that a(n)=[(bn+c)r]-b[nr]-[cr].  If r>0 and b and c are integers satisfying b>=2 and 0<=c<=b-1, then 0<=a(n)<=b.  The positions of 0 in the sequence a are of interest, as are the position sequences for 1,2,...,b.  For c=0, there are b of these position sequences, and they comprise a partition of the positive integers.
