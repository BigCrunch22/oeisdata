%N A190900 Positive integers without recursively self-conjugate partitions.
%C A190900 Numbers with recursively self-conjugate partitions are given in A190899.  See that sequence or the Keith reference for more details.
%C A190900 It is proved in the reference that this list is exhaustive.

%e A190900 From _Michael De Vlieger_, Oct 23 2018: (Start)
%e A190900 None of the partitions of 5, {{5}, {4,1}, {3,2}, {3,1,1}, {2,2,1}, {2,1,1,1}, {1,1,1,1,1}} are self-conjugate, thus 5 is in the sequence.
%e A190900 The partition {4,4,2,2} of 12 is self-conjugate and is made up of Durfee squares thus 12 is not in the sequence.
%e A190900 The partition {8,5,5,5,4,1,1,1} of 30 is self-conjugate. We eliminate the Durfee square {4,4,4,4} which leaves us with {4,1,1,1} which is self-conjugate, but when we eliminate the Durfee square {1} from this, we are left with {1,1,1} which is not self-conjugate. There are no other self-conjugate partitions of 30, therefore 30 is in the sequence.
%e A190900 Both self-conjugate partitions of 32 are not recursively so. Thus 32 is in the sequence. (End)
