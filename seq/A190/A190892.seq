%N A190892 Numbers that can be written as a*b = c*d*e, where a, b, c, d, and e are distinct composite numbers.
%C A190892 Similar to A175340, but without the requirement that the composite numbers be consecutive. In this case, the k in A175340 can be taken to be 2.
%C A190892 Almost all numbers are in this sequence. Its complement has density O(n (log log n)^4/log n). - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, May 23 2011
