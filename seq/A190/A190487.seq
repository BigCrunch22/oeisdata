%N A190487 a(n) = [(bn+c)r]-b[nr]-[cr], where (r,b,c)=(sqrt(2),3,0) and []=floor.
%C A190487 Write a(n) = [(bn+c)r]-b[nr]-[cr]. If r>0 and b and c are integers satisfying b>=2 and 0<=c<=b-1, then 0<=a(n)<=b. The positions of 0 in the sequence a are of interest, as are the position sequences for 1,2,...,b. These b+1 position sequences comprise a partition of the positive integers.
