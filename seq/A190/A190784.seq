%N A190784 Numbers whose binary representation is a substring of the concatenation of the binary representation of all smaller nonnegative integers not listed earlier, taken in decreasing order.
%C A190784 Also, nonnegative integers which do not occur in A118250.
%C A190784 Up to the reversed (decreasing) order of concatenation, a binary analog of Hannah Rollman's numbers A048992.
%e A190784 The binary representation of 2="10"[2] is a substring of the concatenation of 1 and 0, therefore a(1)=2. This term a(1)=2="10" will henceforth be excluded from the concatenations considered in the sequel.
%e A190784 The binary representations of 3, 4 and 5 are not a substrings of concat("1", "0") resp. concat("11", "1", "0") resp. concat("100", "11", "1", "0"). (Note that 2="10" is not among the concatenated numbers.)
%e A190784 But 6="110"[2] is again a substring of concat(5="101", 4="100", 3="11", "1", "0"), therefore a(2)=6. In the sequel, a(2)=6="110" will now also be always excluded from the concatenations, as is a(1)=2.
%Y A190784 Analog of A128291 for the "with reversal" variant A118250 of A118248.
%Y A190784 Cf. A048991, A048992.
