%N A190731 Prime interlaced primes (PIP).
%C A190731 Let j and k be positive integers with 0<=j-k<=1. Let r and s be positive integers with digit expansions {r_0, r_1, ..., r_j} and {s_0, s_1, ..., s_k}, respectively. The two numbers r, s may be interlaced, denoted by Intrl(r,s), by combining their digit expansions giving Intrl(r,s)={r_0,s_0,...,r_k,s_k}, when j=k, or Intrl(r,s)={r_0,s_0,...,r_k,s_k,r_(k+1)}, when j=k+1. Suppose r and s are prime numbers that can be interlaced. Then a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the number represented by Intrl(r,s) to be prime is that r and s be congruent modulo 6, in which case r and s are said to be "compatible primes" (for otherwise the sum of their combined digits is divisible by three, when r>3 and s>3). Thus, this sequence is determined by those primes (taken in order, smallest to largest) with digit expansions Intrl(p,q) such that p and q are compatible prime numbers, and a(n) is the n-th "prime interlaced prime."
%e A190731 p=17 and q=89 are compatible primes. Intrl(17,89)={1,8,7,9} and a(50)=1879 is a prime interlaced prime.
