%N A190287 Decimal expansion of (5+sqrt(25+4r))/2, where r=sqrt(5).
%C A190287 The rectangle R whose shape (i.e., length/width) is (5+sqrt(25+4r))/2, where r=sqrt(5), can be partitioned into rectangles of shapes 5 and r in a manner that matches the periodic continued fraction [5, r, 5, r,  ...].  R can also be partitioned into squares so as to match the nonperiodic continued fraction [5,2,2,2,1,1,1,10,1,1,2,1,...] at A190288.  For details, see A188635.
