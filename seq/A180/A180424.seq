%N A180424 "ARE(n,k)" triangle read by rows. ARE(n,k) is the number of aperiodic k-reverses of n up to cyclic equivalence.
%C A180424 A k-composition of n is an ordered collection of k positive integers (parts) which sum to n.
%C A180424 A k-composition is aperiodic (primitive) if its period is k, or if it is not the concatenation of at least two smaller compositions.
%C A180424 Two k-compositions are cyclically equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by a cyclic permutation of its parts.
%C A180424 The reverse of a k-composition is the k-composition obtained by writing its parts in reverse. For example, the reverse of 123 is 321.
%C A180424 A k-reverse of n is a k-composition of n which is cyclically equivalent to its reverse. And an aperiodic k-reverse of n is a k-reverse of n which is aperiodic.
%C A180424 For example, 114 is an aperiodic 3-reverse of 6 since it is aperiodic and its set of cyclic equivalents {114,411,141} contains its reverse 411.
%C A180424 But 123 is not an aperiodic 3-reverse of 6 since, even though it is aperiodic, its set of cyclic equivalents {123,312,231} does not contain its reverse 321.
%C A180424 Let AR(n,k) denote the number of aperiodic k-reverses of n, then sequence A180279 is the 'AR(n,k)' triangle read by rows.
%C A180424 For the above sequence we count the aperiodic k-reverses of n up to cyclic equivalence, ARE(n,k), in other words, the number of equivalence classes under cyclic permutation which contain at least one aperiodic k-reverse of n.

%e A180424 For example, row 8 is 1 3 3 4 3 3 1 0.
%e A180424 We have ARE(8,3)=3 because there are 9 aperiodic 3-reverses of 8 in the 3 classes {116,611,161}, {224,422,242}, and {233,323,332}, and so there are ARE(8,3)=3 aperiodic 3-reverses of 8 up to cyclic equivalence.
%e A180424 We have ARE(8,6)=3 because there are 3 aperiodic 6-reverses of 8 up to cyclic equivalence. The representatives of the 3 classes are 111113, 111122, and 111212.

%Y A180424 As mentioned above, if we don't count the classes, but rather the elements in the classes, we get sequence A180279.
%Y A180424 If we remove the aperiodic requirement, see sequence A119963.
%Y A180424 The row sums of the "ARE(n, k)" triangle above give sequence A056493 (except for the first term). See also sequence A056498.
