%N A180734 Numbers the absolute value of whose deficiency is a deficient number.
%C A180734 Companion sequences are numbers the absolute value of whose deficiency is a perfect number, numbers the absolute value of whose deficiency is an abundant number. Every nonnegative integer is in one of these three sequences.

%e A180734 a(1) = 1 because the deficiency of 1 is 1, and 1 is itself a deficient number.
%e A180734 a(10) = 12 because the deficiency of 12 is -4 and  | -4 | = 4 is a deficient number.
%e A180734 7 is not in the sequence because the deficiency of 7 is 6, and 6 is a perfect number.
%e A180734 13 is not in the sequence because the deficiency of 13 is 12, and 12 is an abundant number.
