%N A180566 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of unordered pairs of nodes at distance k in the Fibonacci tree of order n (entries in row n are the coefficients of the corresponding Wiener polynomial).
%C A180566 A Fibonacci tree of order n (n>=2) is a complete binary tree whose left subtree is the Fibonacci tree of order n-1 and whose right subtree is the Fibonacci tree of order n-2; each of the Fibonacci trees of order 0 and 1 is defined as a single node.
%C A180566 Row n (n>=3) contains 2n-3 entries.
%C A180566 Sum of entries of row n is (F(n+1) - 1)(2F(n+1) - 1), where F(j)=A000045(j) are the Fibonacci numbers.
%C A180566 T(n,1) = 2*F(n+1)-2 = number of edges in the Fibonacci tree of order n.
%C A180566 Sum(k*T(n,k), k>=0) = A180567 (the Wiener index of the Fibonacci tree of order n).

%F A180566 The Wiener polynomial w(n,t) of the Fibonacci tree of order n satisfies the recurrence relation w(n,t)=w(n-1,t) + w(n-2,t) + t*r(n-1,t) + t*r(n-2,t) + t^2*r(n-1,t)*r(n-2,t), w(0,t)=w(1,t)=0, where r(n,t) is the generating polynomial of the nodes of the Fibonacci tree of order n with respect to the level of the nodes (for example, 1+2t for the tree /\; see A178522 and the Maple program).
%e A180566 T(2,2)=1 because in the Fibonacci tree of order 2, namely /\, there is only 1 pair of nodes at distance 2 (the two leaves).
