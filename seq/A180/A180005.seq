%N A180005 Numbers n with the property that the relation 1-d!/((d-i)!d^i)>1/2 holds for integers d>2 between i-1 and n+i-1.
%C A180005 The expression is the "birthday problem" probability out of d equally possible birthdays, while given d, i ranges between the smallest integer for which the relation holds and d, and n is the number of values of d for which the relation holds given i.
