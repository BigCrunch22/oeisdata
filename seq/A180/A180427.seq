%N A180427 Lexicographically earliest permutation of the positive integers such that the inverse permutation is also the absolute value of the first differences.
%e A180427 Let a(n) be this sequence and b(n)=|a(n)-a(n+1)| be the inverse permutation of this sequence.
%e A180427 After a(1)=1, a(2)=2, a(3)=4, the next term, a(4), cannot be a repeat of 1,2, or 4 since by definition a(n) must be a permutation of the positive integers.
%e A180427 It cannot be 3,5, or 6, as that would force b(3)=1 or 2 (a repeat of b(1)=1, or b(2)=2).
%e A180427 We cannot have a(4)=7, because b(3)=3 implies a(3)=3, which contradicts a(3)=4.
%e A180427 We cannot have a(4)=8, because b(3)=4 implies a(4)=3.
%e A180427 We cannot have a(4)=9, because b(3)=5 implies a(5)=3, and b(4)=|a(5)-a(4)|=6 which contradicts b(4)=3 as implied by a(3)=4.
%e A180427 Therefore a(4)=10 is the smallest value of a(4) which will not generate a contradiction.
%Y A180427 Cf. A180428 - Inverse Permutation of this sequence. Also the first differences (absolute value) of this sequence.
