%N A180333 Triangle in which row n has n semiprimes such that (p+1)(q+1) is the same for each semiprime pq and (p+1)(q+1) is as small as possible.
%C A180333 This sequence was inspired by A180328, but there the semiprime pq is assumed to consist of distinct primes p and q. The value of (p+1)(q+1) for each row is in A180334.
