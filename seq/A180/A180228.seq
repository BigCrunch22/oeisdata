%N A180228 Triangular array T(A,B) read by rows: minimal number of steps required to obtain exactly 2 liters in jug A (irrespective of jug B), starting with infinite supply of water and two empty jugs with capacities A and B liters. -1 if not possible. A>=B>=1.
%C A180228 In the two-jug problem we are given an infinite supply of water and two empty jugs with integer liter capacities A and B, A>=B>=1. We must use the least number of steps to measure exactly N integer liters of water in jug A, irrespective of jug B. Each step is one of the following: empty a jug, fill a jug, or pour from one jug to the other. Pouring stops as soon as the source jug is empty or the destination jug is full. It is known that the amount N can be made if only if N is a multiple of gcd(A,B).
