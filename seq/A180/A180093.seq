%N A180093 Arises in calculating the maximum gap in (inverse) cyclotomic polynomials.
%C A180093 2nd column of table on p.4 of Hong, the first column of which are the first 8 odd primes. The maximum gap, g(f), is the maximum of the differences (gaps) between two consecutive exponents occurring in f where f = Phi_n or f = Psi_n.
