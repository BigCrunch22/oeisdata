%N A180604 Number of "pieces" of the n-th Brillouin zone of a 2D hexagonal lattice.
%C A180604 Each Brillouin zone has the same area, and they are all equivalent mod the periodicity of the lattice, but the higher-order ones consist of a set of polygons. This is the number of polygons in that set.
%e A180604 The 2nd Brillouin zone consists of 6 equilateral triangles, so a(2) = 6. The 5th Brillouin zone consists of 12 30-60-90 triangles, so a(5) = 12.
