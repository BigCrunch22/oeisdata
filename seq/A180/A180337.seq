%N A180337 Numbers which cannot be expressed as a sum 1 + p1 + p1*p2 + p1*p2*p3 + ... for some collection of primes {p1, p2, p3, ...}.
%C A180337 I conjecture, but have not been able to prove, that this sequence is finite with only the terms given above. In that case it can be constructed by taking a1=2, and adjoining all numbers aj*ak + 1, where aj and ak are two prime members of the sequence.
%C A180337 Any number which can be expressed as p*q + 1, where p is prime and q does not belong to the sequence, does not belong to the sequence either.

%e A180337 8 is not a member of the sequence since it is equal to 1 + 7.
%e A180337 9 is not a member of the sequence since it can be written 1 + 2 + 2*3.
%e A180337 10 is not a member of the sequence since it is equal to 1 + 3 + 3*2.
%e A180337 11 is a member of the sequence. If 11 could be written in this form, then p1 must divide 10. We would have 11 = 1 + p1(1 + p2 + ...), which would imply that 5 is not a member of the sequence if p1 = 2, or vice versa. Since both 2 nor 5 are members, so is 11.
