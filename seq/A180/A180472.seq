%N A180472 Triangle T(n, k) = OC(n, k; not -1), read by rows, where OC(n, k; not -1) is the number of k-subsets of Z_n without -1 as a multiplier, up to congruency.
%C A180472 Let Z_n = {0,1,...,n-1} denote the integers mod n.
%C A180472 Let S be a k-subset of Z_n.
%C A180472 Then S has multiplier -1 iff there is a z in Z_n for which S = -S + z. Otherwise, S doesn't have multiplier -1.
%C A180472 For example in Z_7 the set S = {0,1,2} has multiplier -1 since -S = {0,-1,-2} = {0,5,6} and then {0,1,2} = {0,5,6} + 2, so S = -S + 2. But S={0,1,3} doesn't have multiplier -1.
%C A180472 Let S and S' be two k-subsets of Z_n.
%C A180472 Define an equivalence relation on the set of k-subsets as follows: S is congruent to S' iff S=S'+z or S = -S' + z for some z in Z_n.
%C A180472 Then define OC(n, k) to be the number of such congruence classes.
%C A180472 And define OC(n, k; not -1) to be the number of such congruence classes in which the representative doesn't have -1 as a multiplier.
%C A180472 Then this sequence is the 'OC(n,k; not -1)' triangle read by rows.
%C A180472 For convenience we start the triangle at n = 0, and we have 0 <= k <= n.
%C A180472 See the McSorley and Schoen (2013) reference below for equivalent definitions of this sequence in terms of (n,k)-Ovals and k-compositions of n.
%C A180472 From _Petros Hadjicostas_, May 29 2019: (Start)
%C A180472 Here, T(n, k) is the number of bracelets (turnover necklaces) of length n that have no reflection symmetry and consist of k white beads and n - k black beads. (Bracelets that have no reflection symmetry are also known as chiral bracelets.)
%C A180472 It is also the number of dihedral compositions of n into k parts with no reflection symmetry. It is also the number of dihedral compositions of n into n - k parts with no reflection symmetry. (For a definition of a dihedral composition, see Knopfmacher and Robbins (2013) in the references.)
%C A180472 For MacMahon's method for transforming a cyclic composition into a necklace and vice versa, see the comments for sequence A308401. See also p. 273 in Sommerville (1909).

%e A180472 For example the row which corresponds to Z_7 is: 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0.
%e A180472 The first '1' here corresponds to the 3-subsets of Z_7.
%e A180472 There are 4 congruence classes of the 3-subsets of Z_7, their representatives are {0,1,2}, {0,2,4}, {0,1,4} and {0,1,3}. The first 3 representatives have multiplier -1, but the last doesn't. Hence there is just one 3-subset of Z_7 without multiplier -1, up to congruency.

%Y A180472 This sequence is A052307-A119963. The sequence A052307 is formed from the triangle whose (n, k)-term is the number of k-subsets of Z_n up to congruence, and the sequence A119963 is formed from the triangle whose (n, k)-term is the number of k-subsets of Z_n with multiplier -1 up to congruence.
