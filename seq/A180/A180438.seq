%N A180438 a(n) counts the distinct cubical (on alphabet of 3 symbols) billiard words with length n, acting as prefix to just k = 2 such words of length n+1 (that is, a subset of "special").
%C A180438 By symmetry under reversal, a(n) also counts length n cubical billiard words acting as suffix to just k length n+1 cubical billiard words. Computation: _Fred Lunnon_ for 0 <= n <= 19 (Magma). The program in A180437 counts k-special words for k = 1, ..., m, where m = 3 denotes the size of the alphabet.
