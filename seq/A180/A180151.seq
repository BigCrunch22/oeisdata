%N A180151 Numbers k such that k and k + 2 are both divisible by exactly five primes (counted with multiplicity).
%C A180151 "5-almost primes" that keep that property when incremented by 2. This sequence is to 5 as 4 is to A180150, as 3 is to A180117, as A092207 is to 2, and as A001359 is to 1. That is, this sequence is the 5th row of the infinite array A[k,n] = n-th natural number m such that m and m+2 are both divisible by exactly k primes (counted with multiplicity). The first row is the lesser of twin primes. The second row is the sequence such that m and m+2 are both semiprimes.

%e A180151 a(1) = 270 because 270 = 2 * 3^3 * 5 is divisible by exactly 5 primes (counted with multiplicity), and so is 270+2 = 272 = 2^4 * 17.
