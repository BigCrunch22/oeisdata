%N A180930 Numbers n such that the sum of divisors of n is a hexagonal number.
%C A180930 This is to A006532 (numbers n such that sum of divisors is a square) as A000326 (Pentagonal numbers) is to A000290 (squares); and as A180929 (Numbers n such that the sum of divisors of n is a pentagonal number) is to A000326 (Pentagonal numbers); and as A045746 (Numbers n such that the sum of divisors of n is a triangular number) is to A000217 (triangular numbers), and as A000384 (Hexagonal numbers) is to A000290 (squares).
%C A180930 54, 56, 87, and 95 are the smallest four numbers whose sum of divisors is the same hexagonal number (120).

%F A180930 A000203(a(n)) is in A000384. sigma(a(n) = k*(2*k-1) for some nonnegative integer k. Sum of divisors of a(n) is a hexagonal number. sigma_1(a(n)) is a hexagonal number.
%e A180930 a(1) = 1 because the sum of divisors of 1 is the hexagonal number 1.
%e A180930 a(2) = 5 because the sum of divisors of 5 is the hexagonal number 6.
%e A180930 a(3) = 8 because the sum of divisors of 8 is the hexagonal number 15.
%e A180930 a(4) = 12 because the sum of divisors of 12 is the hexagonal number 28.
