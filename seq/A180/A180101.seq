%N A180101 a(0)=0, a(1)=1; thereafter a(n) = largest prime factor of sum of all previous terms.
%C A180101 More precisely, a(n) = A006530 applied to sum of previous terms.
%C A180101 Inspired by A175723.
%C A180101 Except for initial terms, same as A076272, but the simple definition warrants an independent entry.
%F A180101 For the purposes of this paragraph, regard 0 as the (-1)st prime and 1 as the 0th prime. Conjectures: All primes appear; the primes appear in increasing order;  the k-th prime p(k) appears p(k+1)-p(k-1) times (cf. A031131); and p(k) appears for the first time at position A164653(k) (sums of two consecutive primes). These assertions are stated as conjectures only because I have not written out a formal proof, but they are surely true.
%Y A180101 Cf. A006530, A076272, A175723, A180107 (partial sums).
