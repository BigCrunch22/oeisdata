%N A180204 Base-10 representation of numbers k which, in base 2, satisfy abs(k + reverse(k) - reverse(k + reverse(k))) = k.
%C A180204 A006995 is a subsequence of this sequence, because a palindrome plus its reverse is equivalent to itself times 2, which in base 2 is equivalent to appending a zero to the number. This zero is eliminated by the second reversal, leaving the reverse of the original number, which, since it is a palindrome, is the equivalent of the number itself, and 2x - x = x.
