%N A180934 n^k has n divisors for some k >= 1.
%C A180934 All primes p are in this sequence, since p^(p-1) has p divisors.
%C A180934 For all odd semiprimes s, s^2 is in this sequence, since s^((s-1)/2) has s divisors.

%e A180934 11^10 has 11 divisors, so 11 is in the sequence.
%e A180934 225^7 has 225 divisors, so 225 is in the sequence.
%Y A180934 A000005(n^k) = n for some k >= 1.
%Y A180934 A180935 gives corresponding k.
