%C A180968 From _R. J. Mathar_, Sep 11 2012: (Start)
%C A180968 Not the sum of 7 positive squares: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14, 17, 20.
%C A180968 Not the sum of 8 positive squares: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 18, 21.
%C A180968 Not the sum of 9 positive squares: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 19, 22.

%F A180968 Let B be the set of integers {1,2,4,5,7,10,13}. Then, for s>=6, every integer can be partitioned into a sum of s positive squares except for 1,2,...,s-1 and s+b where b is a member of the set B [Dubouis].
%e A180968 As the sixth integer which cannot be partitioned into a sum of six positive squares is 7, we have a(6)=7.
