%N A180149 Integers with precisely two partitions into sums of four squares of nonnegative numbers.
%C A180149 The largest odd member of this sequence is 71, and from a(32)=320 onwards the terms satisfy the eighth-order recurrence relation a(n)=4a(n-8).

%F A180149 The members of this sequence are {9, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 30, 31, 35, 39, 46, 47, 71} together with all integers of the form 5*2^N, 11*2^N and {1,3,30,46}*4^N where N > 0 (which includes a necessary correction to Lehmer's result).
%e A180149 As the fifth integer which has precisely two partitions into sums of four squares of nonnegative numbers is 13, then a(5)=13.
