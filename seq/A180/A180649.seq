%N A180649 The difference A046682 - A180652.
%C A180649 A046682 is a bound on the number of different multisets of hook lengths for partitions of n, A180652 is the actual count. So this sequence looks at collisions.
%e A180649 It is trivial (by conjugation) that [6, 3, 3, 2] and [4, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1] have the same multiset of hook lengths. Similarly, the pair [5, 5, 2, 1, 1] and [5, 3, 2, 2, 2] are conjugate, so they have the same multiset of hook lengths. What is nontrivial is that those two multisets are the same, explaining the nonzero entry when n=14.
%Y A180649 Cf. A046682, A180652.
