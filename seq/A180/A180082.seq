%N A180082 Semiprime centered cube numbers: m^3 + (m+1)^3.
%C A180082 There are no prime centered cube numbers because m^3 + (m+1)^3 = (2m+1)*(m^2+m+1). - _Zak Seidov_, Feb 08 2011
%C A180082 Products of two primes p and q = (p^2+3)/4 with p's in A118939. - _Zak Seidov_, Feb 08 2011
%C A180082 From _Lamine Ngom_, Apr 17 2021: (Start)
%C A180082 Also numbers which are products of two primes whose sum and difference are both promic (A002378).
%C A180082 Subsequence of A217843 (sums of consecutive nonnegative cubes) limited to the terms that have only two prime factors (multiplicity counted).
%C A180082 As stated in A217843, any number that is the sum of consecutive nonnegative cubes can also be expressed as the product of two integers whose sum and difference are both promic. (Therefore, it cannot be prime.) It can also be expressed as the difference of the squares of two triangular numbers (A000217); thus, the two primes that are the factors of any term of this sequence are respectively the sum and difference of two triangular numbers.
