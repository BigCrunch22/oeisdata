%N A180230 a(n) is the minimal number of additions needed to grow to radius n, in the two-dimensional abelian sandpile growth model with h=2.
%C A180230 The abelian sandpile growth model starts with height h on every site of the square grid.
%C A180230 An addition increases the height of the origin by 1. After each addition, the model is stabilized by toppling unstable sites.
%C A180230 A site is unstable if its height is at least 4; in a toppling, its height decreases by 4 and the height of its neighbors increases by 1.
%C A180230 If h=2, then for any number of additions, the set of sites that toppled at least once is a square. This was proved in Fey-Redig-2008.
%C A180230 For all n, a(n) <= (2n+3)^2. In Fey-Levine-Peres-2010, it was proved that for n large enough, a(n) >= Pi/4 n^2.

%e A180230 After 2 additions, the origin is unstable and topples once. Then every site is stable. Therefore a(0)=2.
%e A180230 After 4 more additions, the origin topples again. Then more sites become unstable, so that the set of sites that toppled at least once becomes the square with radius 1. Therefore a(1) = 6.
