%N A180603 Number of "pieces" of the n-th Brillouin zone of a 2D square lattice.
%C A180603 Each Brillouin zone has the same area, and they are all equivalent mod the periodicity of the lattice, but the higher-order ones consist of a set of polygons. This is the number of polygons in that set.

%e A180603 The 2nd Brillouin zone consists of 4 right isosceles triangles, so a(2) = 4. The 4th Brillouin zone consists of 8 triangles and 4 kites, so a(4) = 12.
%Y A180603 Cf. A180604, A199765, A199766.
