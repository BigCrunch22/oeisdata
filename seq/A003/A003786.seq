%N A003786 Day-of-month at weekly intervals from Jan 01 of a leap year.
%C A003786 Currently the starting (leap) year is not fixed and therefore the continuation of the sequence becomes ambiguous when terms correspond to a time beyond the month of February of the fifth year (which would most often, but not always, be a leap year again). If the starting year is made precise, for example 2000, then the sequence could be extended to range over a century or more. - _M. F. Hasler_, Jul 24 2023
