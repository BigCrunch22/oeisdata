%N A003996 Sums of distinct nonzero squares in more than one way.
%C A003996 The largest integer not in this sequence is 132.  Proof based on Theorem 3 from M. J. Wiener link: All the numbers from 148+1 to 148+12^2 are the sum of distinct squares from {1^2,...,11^2} in more than one way (direct calculation). This range can be extended indefinitely by adding 12^2, 13^2, etc. Numbers between 132 and 148 confirmed from A033461. - _Martin Fuller_, Aug 28 2023
