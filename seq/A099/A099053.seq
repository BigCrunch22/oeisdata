%N A099053 a(n) is the smallest number of 1s and 2s that are needed to construct n using any number of +, -, *, ^ signs but not allowing concatenation of digits.
%C A099053 Subexpressions can be grouped as needed; equivalently, any number of parentheses can be used in the expression.
%C A099053 Yet another definition of the complexity of a number.
%C A099053 It can be assumed that no subexpression can be <= 0. The only way to generate a negative value is to take a-b with a < b; taking b-a instead gives the absolute value of this expression. For any further number generated using the negative value, the absolute value of that number is obtainable using the absolute value of the subexpression(s). Generating an intermediate zero is useless. - _Franklin T. Adams-Watters_, Jul 29 2011
