%N A099654 a(n) is the number of n-subsets [n=1,2,...,10] of the 10 decimal digits from which no prime numbers can be constructed. See also A099653.
%C A099654 Number of "antiprime-digit-subclasses".
%C A099654 Subsets were selected from {0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8} and {0, 3, 6, 9} digit collections.
%F A099654 a(n) = binomial(6,n) + binomial(4,n) for n > 1.
%e A099654 n=1: {0,2,4,6,8} represent the relevant 1-subsets so a[1]=5.
%e A099654 Total number of prime irrelevant subset-classes from the 1023 nonempty k-digit-subsets equals 5 + 21 + 24 + 16 + 6 + 1 = 73 = 1023 - 950. See also A099653.
%e A099654 The "antiprime n-digit-collections" are taken from {0,2,4,5,6,8} or {0,3,6,9}, of which only composites can be constructed.
