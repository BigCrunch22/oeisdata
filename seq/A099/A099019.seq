%N A099019 Odd composite numbers n such that n-2 and n+2 are also composite.
%C A099019 No term is the difference of two primes. - _Juri-Stepan Gerasimov_, Oct 10 2009
%C A099019 Goldbach's conjecture states that all even numbers > 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. If true, then this sequence contains all composites which cannot be expressed as the sum or difference of two primes. - _Bob Selcoe_, Mar 10 2015
