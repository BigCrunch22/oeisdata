%N A099309 Numbers n whose k-th arithmetic derivative is nonzero for all k. Complement of A099308.
%C A099309 Numbers of the form n = m*p^p (where p is prime), i.e., multiples of some term in A051674, have n' = (m + m')*p^p, which is again of the same form, but strictly larger iff m > 1. Therefore successive derivatives grow to infinity in this case, and they are constant when m = 1. There are other terms in this sequence, but I conjecture that they all eventually lead to a term of this form, e.g., 26 -> 15 -> 8 etc. - _M. F. Hasler_, Apr 09 2015
