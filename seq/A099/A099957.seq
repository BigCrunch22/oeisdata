%C A099957 The n-th term is the number of notes of the (2n-1)-limit tonality diamond. This is a term from music theory and means the scale consisting of the rational numbers r, 1 <= r < 2, such that the odd part of both the numerator and the denominator of r, when reduced to lowest terms, is less than or equal to the fixed odd number 2n-1. - _Gene Ward Smith_, Mar 27 2006
%C A099957 (1/4)*Number of distinct angular positions under which an observer positioned at the center of a square of a square lattice can see the (2n) X (2n) points symmetrically surrounding his position.
%C A099957 (1/8)*number of distinct angular positions under which an observer positioned at a lattice point of a square lattice can see the (2n+1)X(2n+1) points symmetrically surrounding his position gives A002088.
%C A099957 (1/2)*number of distinct angular positions under which an observer positioned at the center of an edge of a square lattice can see the (2n)X(2n-1) points symmetrically surrounding his position gives A099958.
