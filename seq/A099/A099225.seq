%N A099225 Numbers of the form m^k+k, with m and k > 1.
%C A099225 For n=11, there are two representations: 2^3+3 and 3^2+2. All other numbers < 10^16 of this form have a unique representation. The uniqueness question leads to a Pillai-like exponential Diophantine equation a^x-b^y = y-x for y > x > 1 and b > a > 1, which appears to have only one solution.
