%N A099502 Numbers n such that A099501(n) = 3.
%C A099502 Granville and Selfridge discuss the numbers n+1 in their paper. For each of these n<10000, Scott Contini found three integers between n^2 and (n+1)^2 such that their product is twice a square. There are 123 instances of n < 10000; 215 instances for n < 20000.
