%N A099303 Greatest integer x such that x' = n, or 0 if there is no such x, where x' is the arithmetic derivative of x.
%C A099303 This is the largest member of the set I(n) in the paper by Ufnarovski and Ahlander. They show that a(n) <= (n/2)^2.
%C A099303 Because this sequence is quite different for even and odd n, it is bisected into A102084 and A189762. The upper bound for odd n appears to be (n/3)^(3/2), which is attained when n = 3p^2 for primes p>5. - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 27 2011
