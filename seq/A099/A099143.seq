%N A099143 Least k such that S(k) = S(k+n), or 0 if there is no k, where S is the Kempner function A002034.
%C A099143 The case of n=1 corresponds to the Tutescu conjecture, which states that the equation S(k) = S(k+1) has no solutions. It is conjectured that S(k) = S(k+6) also has no solutions. For odd prime p, a(p) = p. It appears that a(n) <= n, except for n = 1, 2, 6, 24, 48, 120, 240, 720 (A099144).
