%N A099120 Least m such that n = S(k) = S(k+m) for some k, where S is the Kempner function A002034.
%C A099120 Consider the set Sn of d(n!)-d((n-1)!) positive integers k with S(k) = n, where d is the divisor counting function A000005. For each n, a(n) gives the least difference of integers in the set Sn. For prime n, a(n) = n. For n a power of a prime, a(n) = A046021(n), the least k in Sn. The Tutescu conjecture, which states that the equation S(k) = S(k+1) has no solutions, is equivalent to a(n) > 1 for all n.
