%N A013645 Values of k at which the period of the continued fraction for sqrt(k) sets a new record.
%C A013645 Periods of the fractions (sequence offset by one term) are given by A020640.
%C A013645 For n = 1 to 513 (the range of the b-file), the class number of the field Q(sqrt(a(n))) is 1 (computed with Mathematica). - _Emmanuel Vantieghem_, Mar 16 2017

%e A013645 The continued fraction for sqrt(31) is {5; 1, 1, 3, 5, 3, 1, 1, 10}, the continued fraction for sqrt(43) is {6; 1, 1, 3, 1, 5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 12}, and there is no number between 31 and 43 whose square root produces a continued fraction whose period exceeds that of 31.
