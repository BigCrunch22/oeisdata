%N A272203 P-defects p - N(p) of the congruence y^2 == x^3 - 1 (mod p) for primes p, where N(p) is the number of solutions given by A272202(n).
%C A272203 The analysis of this elliptic curve runs along the same lines as in A000727, A272197 and A272198, and it is inspired by the Silverman reference where the curve y^2 = x^3 + 1 modulo primes is treated.
%C A272203 The series showing the modularity pattern is the expansion of the 67th modular cusp form of weight 2 and level N=144, given in the table I of the Martin reference, i.e., eta^{12}(12*z)/( eta^4(6*z)*eta^4(24*z)), symbolically 12^{12} 6^(-4) 24^{-4}, in powers of q = exp(2*Pi*i*z), with Im(z) > 0. Here eta is the Dedekind function. See A187076 for the expansion in powers of q^6 (after deleting a factor q^(1/6)). Note that also for the possibly bad prime 2 and the bad prime 3 this expansion gives the correct numbers 0 (the discriminant of this elliptic curve is -3^3).
%C A272203 See also the comment on the Martin-Ono reference in A272202 which implies that 12^{12} 6^(-4) 24^{-4} provides the modularity sequence for this elliptic curve.
%C A272203 If prime(n) == 1 (mod 3) = A002476(m) (for a unique m = m(n)) then prime(n) = A(m)^2 + 3*B(m)^2 with A(m) = A001479(m+1) and B(m) = A001480(m+1), m >= 1. In this case (4*prime(n) - a(n)^2)/12, seems to be a square, q(m)^2. In fact is seems that (the positive) q(m) = B(m). If this conjecture is true then a(n) = 2*(+-sqrt(prime(n) - 3*B(m)^2)) = +- 2*A(m) for prime(n) = A002476(m). This leads to a bisection of the primes 1 (mod 3) into two types: type I if the + sign applies, and type II for the - sign. Primes of type I are given in A272204: 7,13,31,61,67, ... and those of type II in A272205: 19,37,43,73,103, ...

%F A272203 a(n) = prime(n) - N(prime(n)), n = 1, where N(prime(n)) = A272202(n), the number of solutions of the congruence y^2 == x^3 - 1 (mod prime(n)).
%F A272203 a(n) = 0 for prime(n) == 0, 2 (mod 3) (see A045309).
%F A272203 The above given conjecture for primes 1 (mod 3) is expected to be true by analogy to the case A272198 where only the signs differ.
%F A272203 a(n) = +2*A001479(m+1) if prime(n) == A002476(m) (m is unique) is a prime of A272204 (type I).
%F A272203 a(n) = -2*A001479(m+1) if prime(n) == A002476(m) is from A272205 (type II).
%F A272203 See a comment above for this bisection of the primes 1 (mod 3) into type I and II.
%e A272203 a(1) = 2 - A272202(1) = 0, and 2 == 2 (mod 3).
%e A272203 a(4) = 7 - A272202(4) = 7 - 3 = +4, and 7 = A002476(1) = 2^2 + 3*1^2, 2 = A001479(1+1), 7 = A272204(1), hence a(4) = +2*2 = +4.
%e A272203 a(8) = 19 - A272202(8) = 19 - 27 = -8, and 19 = A002476(3) = 4^2 + 3*1^2; 4=A001479(3+1), 19 = A272205(1), hence a(8) = 2*(-4) = -8.
