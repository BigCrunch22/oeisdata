%N A272385 Number of polycubes with n cells, allowing vertex connections and edge connections as well as face connections, distinguishing mirror images.
%e A272385 For n=2 there are three possibilities: the two cubes share a face, or only an edge, or only a vertex.
%e A272385 For n=3, there are 14 tricubes allowing vertex, edge, and face connections. Two of them have distinct mirror images, so a(3) = 16.
%Y A272385 Cf. A272368 (identifying mirror images), A270862 (no vertex connections), A000162 (face connections only).
