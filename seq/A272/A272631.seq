%N A272631 Sum of three or more consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
%C A272631 Except the first term that is 2, this sequence lists non-Fibonacci numbers (A001690) that are the difference of two Fibonacci numbers. So 2 is the only Fibonacci number in this sequence.
%C A272631 Since the sum of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers is obviously a Fibonacci number because of the definition of Fibonacci numbers, this sequence focuses on the sum of three or more consecutive Fibonacci numbers.
%e A272631 4 is a term because Fibonacci(1) + Fibonacci(2) + Fibonacci(3) = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.
