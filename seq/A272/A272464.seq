%N A272464 Fractal sequence related to Stern's diatomic sequence (A002487).
%C A272464 To extend the sequence after a(n): suppose the most recent previous occurrence of a(n) was at a(k) (take the largest such k), if a(k)+a(k+1) does not occur earlier in the sequence, then we extend the sequence with two new terms, setting a(n+1)=a(k)+a(k+1) and a(n+2)=a(k+1); otherwise we get one new term by setting a(n+1)=a(k+1).
%C A272464 As a result of this construction, the last term added (except for the initial term) is always a term that has appeared before, and so k always exists.
%C A272464 The "fractal" property is that if the first occurrence of each term that appears in this sequence is removed, the sequence remains unchanged.
%C A272464 From _Max Barrentine_, Jul 29 2016: (Start)
%C A272464 For the above definition for n and k, does n/k converge to 3/2?
%C A272464 A different way to view this sequence is as Stern's Diatomic sequence (A002487) with repeating odd-indexed terms removed. For instance, A002487(6)=2, A002487(7)=3, and A002487(8)=1 but since 3 has already occurred in the present sequence at a(5), a(6)=2, and a(7)=1. This removes from the present sequence all terms that occur in A002487 between A002487(p)=2 and A002487(q)=1 for the largest p<q, or equivalently A002487(3*2^k) and A002487(2^k+1). (End)

%F A272464 For a(n)=a(k) for largest k<n, m<n:
%F A272464 If a(k)+a(k+1)â‰ a(m), then a(n+1)=a(k)+a(k+1), a(n+2)=a(k+1);
%F A272464 If a(k)+a(k+1)=a(m), then a(n+1)=a(k+1).
%F A272464 a(1)=a(2)=1.
%e A272464 a(2)=1; the previous occurrence of a(n)=1 is a(1). Therefore a(3)=a(1)+a(2)=2, because 2 did not occur earlier in the sequence, and a(4)=a(2)=1.
