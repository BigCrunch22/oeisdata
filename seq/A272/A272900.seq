%C A272900 Let F = A000045, the Fibonacci numbers.  Let s be the sequence of all products F(i)F(j), for 2 <= i < = j, arranged in increasing order; viz., (1,2,3,4,5,6,8,9,10,13,15,...) = (F(2)F(2), F(2)F(3), F(2)F(4), F(3)F(3), F(2)F(5), ... ), as at A049997.  The sequence of first factors is (F(2), F(2), F(2), F(3), F(2),...), represented by indices (2,2,2,3,2,...).  Subtracting 1 from each term leaves A272900, which is a fractal sequence; i.e., the removal of the first occurrence of each term in A272900 leaves A272900, so that the sequence contains itself infinitely many times.
