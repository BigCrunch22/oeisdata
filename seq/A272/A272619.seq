%N A272619 Irregular array read by rows: n-th row contains (in ascending order) the numbers 1 <= k < n such that at least one prime divisor p of k also divides n and at least one prime divisor q of k is coprime to n.
%C A272619 The k are the "semitotatives" of n as counted by A243823(n).
%C A272619 All nonzero terms k are composite and pertain to composite rows n. This is because prime k must either divide or be coprime to n, and k = 1 is both a divisor of and coprime to n. Further, the terms k must have at least two distinct prime divisors p and q.
%C A272619 Row n for prime p contains zero, since numbers 1 <= k < p must either divide or be coprime to prime p.
%C A272619 Row n for prime powers p^e contains all the numbers k in the corresponding row of A133995. There is only one prime divisor p of p^e and every power 1 <= m <= e of p divides p^e, thus none of the terms of the corresponding row of A133995 are in A272618(n).
%C A272619 Rows n = 4 and 6 are special cases of composite n that contains zero. 4 is the smallest composite number; there are no composites k < n. 6 has the prime divisors 2 and 3, thus 5 is the smallest prime coprime to 6; the product of the minimum prime divisor and minimum prime coprime to 6 is 10, which exceeds 6 and falls outside the considered range. The situation is not so for composite n > 6. Thus rows n for composite n > 6 contain at least 1 nonzero value.
%C A272619 The smallest k of row n = A096014(n) < n, i.e., those values of A096014(n) pertaining to composite n > 6, a product of the smallest prime divisor p of n and the smallest prime q coprime to n. The smallest k of n are even squarefree semiprimes since 2 either divides n or is coprime to n and k is by definition a number with at least two distinct primes. The smallest k = 2p for p^2 sets record values for A096014(n) when we ignore values pertaining to prime n, n = 4, and n = 6.
%C A272619 In base n, 1/a(n) has a mixed recurrent expansion.

%e A272619 For n = 12, the numbers 1 <= k < n such that the prime divisors p of k also divide n are {2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9}; {2, 3, 4, 6} divide n = 12, thus row n = 12 is {8, 9}.
