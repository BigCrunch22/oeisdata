%N A272029 Least number k > n such that the multiplicative and additive digital roots of k are both equal to n.
%C A272029 Sequence is trivially finite by definition.
%C A272029 How is the distribution of corresponding digital roots in A064702? This sequence is the result of related observation in limited range.
%e A272029 a(5) = 1157 because 1+1+5+7 = 14, 1+4 = 5 and 1*1*5*7 = 35, 3*5 = 15, 1*5 = 5. 1157 is the least number that is greater than 5 with this property.
