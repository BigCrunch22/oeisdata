%N A272268 Records in A001481 that are more than twice the previous record.
%C A272268 This list can be seen as the r^2 (square of the radius r) of the homocentric circles that are centered at the origin and pass through at least 4 lattice points, the innermost circle being the unit circle.
%C A272268 If we start with the unit circle (x^2 + y^2 = 1), the smallest circle that pass through at least four lattice points would be x^2 + y^2 = 4 with (2,0), (0,2), (-2,0), (0,-2). Similarly next circle would be x^2 + y^2 = 9 passing through (3,0), (0,3), (-3,0), (0,-3), and the next x^2 + y^2 = 20 passing through (2,4), (4,2), (-2,4), (-4,2), (-2,-4), (-4,-2), (2,-4), (4,-2), etc.
%C A272268 It is also worth mentioning that a square can be drawn with vertexes on the lattice points of a circle and the sides of that square wouldn't touch the smaller circle.
