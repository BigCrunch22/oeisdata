%N A272242 a(n) is the least number c such that there are exactly n abc-hits with third member c, or 0 if no such c exists.
%C A272242 An abc-hit is a triple of coprime positive integers a, b, c such that a + b = c and rad(abc) < c, where rad(n) is the largest squarefree number dividing n.
%C A272242 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n. - _Jianing Song_, Sep 21 2018
%H A272242 Wikipedia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abc_conjecture">abc conjecture</a>
%e A272242 a(2) = 81 because there are exactly 2 abc-hits ((1, 80, 81) and (32, 49, 81)) with third member 81 and count of abc-hits with fixed third member c isn't equal to 2 for every c < 81.
