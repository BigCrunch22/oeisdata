%N A272935 Taxi-cab numbers (A001235) that are the product of exactly three (not necessarily distinct) primes.
%C A272935 Note that the sum of two positive cubes cannot be prime except 2, obviously. Additionally, if the sum of two positive cubes is a semiprime, then, all corresponding semiprimes have a unique representation as a sum of two distinct positive cubes (see comment section of A085366). Since we know that 1729 is the first member of A001235 and it has three prime divisors, the minimum value of the number of prime divisors of a taxi-cab number must be three. This was the motivation of the definition of this sequence.
