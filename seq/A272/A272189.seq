%N A272189 Values of A004215(n) such that A004215(n+1) = A004215(n) + 8 = A004215(n-1) + 16.
%C A272189 If there are k consecutive natural numbers and all of them are members of A000378, then the maximum value of k is 7. So if we randomly choose 2*7+1 consecutive natural numbers, at least one of them must be member of A004215. This sequence gives the average of 15 consecutive natural numbers in the case there is exactly one member from A004215 in these 15 consecutive natural numbers. In other words, this sequence gives the most isolated terms of A004215.
%C A272189 Numbers n which are 7 mod 16 such that n+5 and n-7 are sums of three squares, together with numbers n which are 15 mod 16 such that n+1 and n-3 are sums of three squares. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Apr 25 2016
%e A272189 15 is a term because 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 are consecutive members of A000378.
