%e A272041 The sequence is defined here as starting at n=1 to avoid the term a(0). Even though there cannot be exactly zero ways to add zero primes, there is always at least one way to add 0 primes to get any n (i.e., the sum of itself for any nonprime or (1+..+1) for any prime), and zero would be the lowest such number.
%e A272041 Sum of 1 prime in 1 way: 2.
%e A272041 Sum of 2 primes in 2 ways: 3+7 = 5+5 = 10.
%e A272041 Sum of 3 primes in 3 ways: 3+5+7 = 5+5+5 = 2+2+11 = 15.
%e A272041 Sum of 4 primes in 4 ways: 2+2+3+11 = 2+2+7+7 = 3+3+5+7 = 3+5+5+5 = 18.
%e A272041 Sum of 60 primes in 61 ways, e.g.: 57*2 + 3 + 7 + 19 = 37*2 + 23*3 = 143. - _Lars Blomberg_, Jul 18 2017
