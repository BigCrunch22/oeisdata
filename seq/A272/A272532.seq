%N A272532 Single bit representation of the sum of two sinusoids with periods 2 and 2*sqrt(2).
%C A272532 Since the ratio of the two periods is irrational, the sequence is strictly non-periodic.
%C A272532 From the factorized expression of the corresponding real function of x : 2*cos(2Pi((2 - sqrt(2))/8)x)*sin(2Pi((2 + sqrt(2))/8)x), it is possible to see that the largest distance between consecutive zeros is not greater than the shortest semi-period, 4/(2 + sqrt(2)), that is smaller than 2, and from this it follows that there are no more than two consecutive 0's or 1's.
