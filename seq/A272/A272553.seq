%N A272553 Numbers n whose sum of divisors equals the sum of divisors of 2n+1.
%C A272553 Most terms are even; the first three odd ones are 1264545, 8770125, and 9346995, and these are the only odd terms among the first 10^7 numbers  that include  135 terms.
%C A272553 For some n, 2n+1 is prime; for example, this is so for the first three terms, but this happens rarely with only 4 cases among the first 10^7 numbers.
%C A272553 All terms are abundant numbers (A005101): since sigma(x)>x for x>1, sigma(2n+1)>2n+1>2n for n>0, the defining formula, sigma(n)=sigma(2n+1), implies sigma(n)>2n, which proves that n is an abundant number.
%C A272553 Up to 6*10^9 there are 1151 terms, 46 of which are odd. All these odd terms are multiple of 3 and all are multiple of 5, except 1501989489 and 4242679749. The values n for which 2n+1 is a prime number are a subset of A088831, thus it is easy to verify that up to 10^13 there are only 4 such values (20, 464, 650, and 130304). - _Giovanni Resta_, May 03 2016

%F A272553 A000203(n) = A000203(2n+1).
%e A272553 20 is a term as its sum of divisors, 42=1+2+4+5+10+20, is the same as the sum of divisors of 41=2*20+1; 41 has only two divisors 1 and 41.
