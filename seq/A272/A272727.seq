%N A272727 a(0)=0; thereafter a(n+1) is the number of coincidences between  the sequence so far (a(0), ..., a(n)) and its reverse (a(n), ..., a(0)).
%C A272727 a(2n-1) is positive and odd.
%C A272727 a(2n+1) - a(2n-1) is always either 0 or 2.
%C A272727 The number of repetitions of the value 2n-1 is A272729(n).

%F A272727 a(2n)=0.
%F A272727 a(2n-1)=A272728(n)+n.
%e A272727 A one-element series [0] coincides with its own reverse, hence a(1)=1.
%e A272727 [0,1] and [1,0] differ in every term, hence a(2)=0.
%e A272727 [0,1,0] is its own reverse, hence a(3)=3.
%e A272727 [0,1,0,3] and [3,0,1,0] differ in every term, hence a(4)=0.
%e A272727 [0,1,0,3,0] and [0,3,0,1,0] coincide in three terms, hence a(5)=3.
