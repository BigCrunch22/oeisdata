%N A272063 a(n) = largest k such that A004431(n) +/- k are both positive squares.
%C A272063 There can be more than one value of k such that A004431(n) +/- k are both positive squares; i.e., when there are multiple ways to express A004431(n) as the sum of positive squares. These are the terms which appear more than once in A055096. For example A004431(19) = 65 = {(1^2 + 8^2), (4^2 + 7^2)}: 65 +/- 16 = {7^2, 9^2} and 65 +/- 56 = {3^2, 11^2}. So a(19) = 56 rather than 16.
%C A272063 Similar to A270835; differences occur for n<56 at n = {19,25,38,39,42,51}; i.e., terms A004431(n) which appear more than once in A055096.
%C A272063 Sequence contains every even number >=4 and no odd numbers.
%F A272063 a(n) = A004431(n)-1 when A004431(n) = k^2 + (k+1)^2 == A001844(k), k>=1.
%e A272063 a(11)=24 because A004431(11) = 40; 40+24 = 8^2 and 40-24 = 4^2.
%Y A272063 Cf. A001844, A004431, A055096, A270835.
