%N A272907 Lucas-products fractal sequence.
%C A272907 Let L = A000032, the Lucas numbers.  Let s be the sequence of all products L(i)L(j), for 1 <= i < = j, arranged in increasing order; viz., (1,3,4,7,9,11,12,16,18,21,...) = (L(1)L(1), L(1)L(2), L(1)L(3), L(1)L(4), L(2)L(2), L(1)L(5), L(2)L(3), L(3)L(3), L(1)L(6), L(2)L(4),...).  The sequence of first factors is represented by indices A272907 = (1,1,1,1,2,1,2,3,1,2,...), which is a fractal sequence; i.e., the removal of the first occurrence of each term in A272907 leaves A272907, so that the sequence contains itself infinitely many times.
