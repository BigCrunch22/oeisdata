%N A295124 a(n) = smallest number k with n prime factors such that 2d + k/d is prime for every d | k.
%C A295124 Such k must be an odd squarefree number.
%C A295124 a(n) has 2^n divisors and each gives another prime.
%C A295124 Conjecture: the sequence is infinite. It is hard to believe!
%C A295124 a(n) is the smallest k such that A088627(k) = A000005(k) = 2^n.
%F A295124 a(n) = A293756(n+1)/2.
