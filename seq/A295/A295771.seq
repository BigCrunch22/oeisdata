%N A295771 a(n) is the minimum size of a planar additive basis for the square [0,n]^2.
%C A295771 A planar additive basis is a set of points with nonnegative integer coordinates such that their pairwise sums cover a given rectangle of points with integer coordinates. Pairwise sums of a point with itself are included.
%C A295771 a(n) <= 2n+1, because there is an L-shaped basis of that size.
%C A295771 a(n) <= 2n if n is even and nonzero, because of a square-shaped "boundary basis" with sides at coordinates 0 and n/2.

%e A295771 a(3)=7: The square [0,3]^2 is covered by the pairwise sums of the L-shaped basis {(0,0),(1,0),(2,0),(3,0),(0,1),(0,2),(0,3)}, which has 7 elements.
