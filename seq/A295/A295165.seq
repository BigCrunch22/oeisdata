%N A295165 Numbers n such that !n and n!! (A000166(n) and A006882(n)) are coprime.
%C A295165 Odd n is in the sequence iff !n is not divisible by any odd primes < n.
%C A295165 Even n is in the sequence iff !n is not divisible by any odd primes < n/2.
%C A295165 All odd terms are in A083318, all even terms > 2 are in A008864, but both of these are strict inclusions.
%C A295165 Odd terms include 1,3,5,9,17,33,65,257,513,32769.
