%N A295823 Decimal expansion of x > 0 satisfying e + x + e^x*(2x-3) = 0.
%C A295823 Consider the following game: A and B are two players, each having exactly one turn.
%C A295823 A goes first. A chooses random numbers (uniformly distributed in [0,1]) and adds them until he stops. If the sum exceeds 1, A loses and B wins.
%C A295823 If the sum of A's numbers does not exceed 1, then B proceeds as A did, choosing random numbers sequentially until the sum of B's numbers exceeds the sum of A's numbers. If the sum of B's numbers exceeds 1, B loses and A wins; otherwise B wins and A loses.
%C A295823 The optimal strategy for A is to stop as soon as the sum exceeds this constant.
