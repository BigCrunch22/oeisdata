%N A295783 First differences of A293160.
%C A295783 a(n) is the number of distinct numerators that exist in row n of the Kepler tree A294442 but not yet in row n-1 of the tree (assuming a row count such that 1/1 is in row 0).
%C A295783 It is the number of numerators that are "new" in row n (because the set of denominators of row n-1 contributes to the set of numerators of row n).
%C A295783 a(n) is nonnegative because A293160 is monotonically increasing (because all numerators of one row become numerators of the next row).
%C A295783 Define the "entry level" E(j) as the smallest row number at which denominator j appears in A294442 (again: row counts start at 1/1 as row 0), then a(n+1) is the number of occurrences of n in j: a(n+1) = #{j: E(j)=n}.
%C A295783 E(j) = A178047(j), as originally observed by _R. J. Mathar_, because every denominator j first appears both in Kepler's tree (used in E(j)) and in the left half of Stern-Brocot tree (used in A178047) when there is a fraction p/q with p+q=j in the previous row, and the rows of these two trees contain the same fractions (in different orders), assuming the row labeling from A178047 for Stern-Brocot tree. - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Dec 06 2024
