%N A295830 Bi-unitary pseudoperfect numbers that equal to the sum of a subset of their aliquot bi-unitary divisors in a single way.
%C A295830 The bi-unitary version of A064771.
%e A295830 72 is in the sequence since its aliquot bi-unitary divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 18, 36 and {1, 8, 9, 18, 36} is the only subset whose sum is 72.
