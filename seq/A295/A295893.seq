%N A295893 a(n) = 1 if in Doudna-tree (A005940) the contents of the node n and its left-hand child have binary weights with different parity, 0 otherwise.
%C A295893 Like A005940 and A252743 this can be viewed as a binary tree. See illustration below.

%e A295893 For n=0, the corresponding node in A005940(0+1) is 1, which has just one child 2, thus we set a(0) = 0 by convention.
%e A295893 For n=1, the corresponding node in A005940(1+1) is 2, which has 3 as its left-hand child, and in binary 2 is "10", and 3 is "11", so the other one has an odd number of 1-bits, while the other has an even number of 1's, thus their parities differ and a(1) = 1.
%e A295893 For n=2, the corresponding node in A005940(1+2) is 3 (in binary "11"), which has 5 (in binary "101") as its left-hand child, and they have the same parity, thus a(2) = 0.
%e A295893 For n=3, the corresponding node in A005940(1+3) is 4 (in binary "100"), which has 9 (in binary "1001") as its left hand child, and here the parities differ, thus a(3) = 1.
