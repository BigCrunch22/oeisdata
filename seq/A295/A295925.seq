%N A295925 Number of bilaterally asymmetric 8-hoops with n symbols.
%C A295925 This is a corrected version of the entries in sequence A210769, which is copied from the third row of Table 2 (p. 381) in Williamson (1972). Apparently, in that row, there are probable typographical errors for the values of a(4) and a(7). The formula for a(n) can be obtained by letting z_1=z_2=...=z_8=n in equation (24) on p. 377 in Williamson (1972). In any case, to be certain, we provide a sketch of an independent derivation of the formula.
%C A295925 Bilaterally symmetric bracelets are also known as circular palindromes. This kind of necklaces was first studied by Sommerville (1909) in the context of circular compositions.
%C A295925 Consider sequence A081720, which contains the numbers T(n,k) that are the number of bracelets (turn over necklaces) with n beads each of which is colored with one of k colors. The g.f. for column k of that triangle is (1/2)*((k*x+k*(k+1)*x^2/2)/(1-k*x^2) - Sum_{n>=1} (phi(n)/n)*log(1-k*x^n)). The part of the g.f. that is the number of bilaterally symmetric bracelets with n beads of k colors is (k*x+k*(k+1)*x^2/2)/(1-k*x^2). Thus, for fixed k (= number of colors for sequence A081720), the g.f. of the number of bilaterally asymmetric bracelets with n beads of k colors is the difference between the two g.f.'s, that is, (1/2)*(-(k*x+k*(k+1)*x^2/2)/(1-k*x^2) - Sum_{n>=1} (phi(n)/n)*log(1-k*x^n)). The coefficient of x^8 in the Taylor expansion w.r.t. x (around x=0) for the latter g.f. gives the number of bilaterally asymmetric 8-hoops obtained using (up to) k symbols. Taking the 8th derivative w.r.t. x of the last g.f., evaluating at x=0, dividing by 8!, and replacing k with n, we get the formulae given below.

%F A295925 Recurrence: (1-Delta)^9 a(n) = 0, where Delta^m a(n) = a(n-m). Hence, a(n) = 9*a(n-1)-36*a(n-2)+84*a(n-3)-126*a(n-4)+126*a(n-5)-84*a(n-6)+36*a(n-7)-9*a(n-8)+a(n-9).

%e A295925 From the A060560(2) = 30 8-hoops (i.e., from the total number of ways of coloring the vertices of an octagon using up to n=2 colors, allowing for rotations and reflections), there are A019583(2+1) = 24 that are circular palindromes (i.e., bilaterally symmetric bracelets). Hence, there are 30-24=6 bilaterally asymmetric 8-hoops using up to 2 colors. They are the following: 01001111, 01000111, 01000011, 00101011, 00110111 and 11001000. (To view these 6 asymmetric bracelets, the 0's and 1's must be placed on the vertices of a regular octagon inscribed in a circle as it is done in Fig. 4 on p. 379 in Williamson (1972), where 0 is replaced by a and 1 by b.)
