%N A295774 a(n) is the minimum size of a restricted planar additive basis for the square [0,2n]^2.
%C A295774 A planar additive basis for the square [0,2n]^2 is a set of points with nonnegative integer coordinates such that their pairwise sums cover the square. Self-sums are allowed. In a restricted basis all points are in the lower left quadrant [0,n]^2.
%C A295774 Matches A008574 at least up to a(23)=92.
