%N A295422 a(n) = size of the middle part, i.e., the part closest to or crossing the diagonal, in the symmetric representation of sigma(n).
%C A295422 When the symmetric representation of sigma(n) has an even number of parts, e.g., for every prime, the two middle parts have equal size so either one may be chosen.
%C A295422 Since a(45) = 32 while A241558(45) = 23 the two sequences are different, indeed both respective complements of the sequences, A241558 in a and a in A241558, are infinite as the symmetric representations of the following two subsequences of this sequence show:
%C A295422 (1)  n = 5*3^k, k>1, has the 3 parts ( (5*3^k + 1)/2, 4*(3^k - 1), (5*3^k + 1)/2 ) with the middle the largest part.
%C A295422 (2)  n = p^2, p > 2 prime, has the 3 parts ( (p^2 + 1)/2, p, (p^2 + 1)/2 ) with the middle the smallest part.
%C A295422 The parts of the symmetric representation of sigma are in A237270.
%e A295422 a(9) = 3; see the Example in A241558.
%e A295422 a(16) = 31 since its symmetric representation of sigma has one part of width one.
%e A295422 a(41) = 21 since for any odd prime number p, row p of A237270 consists of the two parts: {(p+1)/2, (p+1)/2}.
%e A295422 a(50) = 15 since its symmetric representation of sigma has the three parts 39, 15, and 39.
