%N A295829 Unitary pseudoperfect numbers that equal to the sum of a subset of their aliquot unitary divisors in a single way.
%C A295829 The unitary version of A064771.
%C A295829 It appears that most of the terms are divisible by 3. Terms that are not divisible by 3 are 3770, 5530, 7210, 7630, ... - _Michel Marcus_, Dec 15 2017
%C A295829 The least odd term is 442365. - _Amiram Eldar_, Jun 10 2020
