%N A295298 Numbers n for which sum of the divisors (A000203) and the binary weight of n (A000120) have the same parity.
%C A295298 Numbers n for which A010060(n) = A053866(n).
%C A295298 This sequence is the union of all terms of A028982 (squares and twice squares) that are odious (A000069), and all evil numbers (A001969) that are neither a square or twice a square. See also A231431, A235001.
%C A295298 Sequence A003401 is a subsequence of this sequence. This follows because the only terms in A003401 that are squares or twice squares are the powers of 2 (A000079, that have just one 1-bit, thus are odious), while all the other terms (obtained by multiplying distinct Fermat primes possibly with some power of 2) have an even number of 1-bits, and certainly cannot be squares nor twice squares. - _Antti Karttunen_, Nov 27 2017
