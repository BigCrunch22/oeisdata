%N A295423 a(n) = size of the part containing the diagonal of the symmetric representation of sigma(k) when k is the n-th number with an odd number of parts.
%C A295423 a(n) = middle element of row A071562(n) in A237270.
%C A295423 Every odd prime number p occurs in the sequence since the symmetric representation of p^2 has the three parts ( (p^2 + 1)/2 , p, (p^2 + 1)/2 ).
%C A295423 Let n = 2^m * q, m>=0 and q odd, and let r = floor( (sqrt(8n+1) - 1)/2 ). The symmetric representation of sigma(n) has an odd number of parts precisely when there exists an odd divisor d of q such that d <= r and d*2^(m+1) > r (see the link in A071562).
%C A295423 Conjecture: Every even number, except 2, 4, 6, 10, and 14, occurs as the size of the middle part of the symmetric representation with an odd number of parts.
%C A295423 By symmetry, an even middle part must have an even width at the diagonal constraining the geometry for small areas bounded by adjacent Dyck paths.
%C A295423 Size 2 clearly is impossible with a pair of Dyck paths as boundary.
%C A295423 Size 4 is impossible since the two bounding Dyck paths must end in lengths of 2. However, the rightmost entry in a row of A237591 equals 2 only in rows k*(k+1)/2 - 1, for k>1, so no 2's exist at the diagonal in adjacent Dyck paths.
%C A295423 Size 6 is impossible if Conjecture (2) in A285356 is true since the middle area requires legs of length 3 in the Dyck path at the diagonal; and so are sizes 10 and 14 unless the middle part touches the previous part at a point.
%C A295423 Sizes 6, 10, and 14 do not occur as the middle part for any number n <= 35000 that has an odd number of parts in its symmetric representation of sigma.
%C A295423 For more information see A071562 and A237270.
%e A295423 a(4)  = 12 since A071562(4)  =  6 and row  6 of A237270 is (12).
%e A295423 a(8)  =  8 since A071562(8)  = 15 and row 15 of A237270 is (8, 8, 8).
%e A295423 a(23) =  7 since A071562(23) = 49 and row 49 of A237270 is (25, 7, 25).
%e A295423 a(16) = 63 since A071562(16) = 32 and row 32 of A237270 is (63).
