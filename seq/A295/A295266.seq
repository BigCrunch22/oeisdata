%N A295266 Positive integers whose squares can be represented as the sum or difference of 3-smooth numbers.
%C A295266 In Chapter 7 of de Weger's tract, it is shown that there are no other terms.
%C A295266 More generally, de Weger exposited how one can determine all squares which can be represented as the sum or difference of k-smooth numbers for any given k and determined all integers whose squares can be represented as the sum or difference of 7-smooth numbers, among which the largest one is 14117^2 = 199289869 = 3^13 * 5^3 - 2 * 7^3.
