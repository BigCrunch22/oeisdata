%N A295282 a(n) > n is chosen to minimize the difference between ratios a(n):n and n:(a(n) - n), so that they are matching approximations to the golden ratio.
%C A295282 The difference between the matching ratios is evaluated by dividing the larger by the smaller.
%C A295282 Take a rectangle A with sides n and n+m; remove a square of side n from one end to form rectangle B with sides n and m; scale B in the ratio (n+m):n to form rectangle C with a side n+m. Place A and C alongside, with edges of length n+m coinciding, to form rectangle D. For n > 0, let m_n be the m that has the coincident edges dividing D in nearest to equal proportions, then a(n) = n + m_n.
%C A295282 Compared with other neighboring values of n, the resulting proportions can be made most nearly equal when n is a Fibonacci number F(k) = A000045(k), k > 1, in which case a(n) is F(k+1). In contrast, if 2n is a Fibonacci number F(k), then a relatively good choice for rectangle A's longer side would be F(k+1)/2, except that F(k+1) is odd when F(k) is even, so F(k+1)/2 is halfway between integers.
%C A295282 a(n) is usually the same as A007067(n), but when 2n is a Fibonacci number, they sometimes differ. The first differences are a(4) = 7 = A007067(4) + 1 and a(72) = 117 = A007067(72) + 1. The author expects a(n) to differ from A007067(n) if and only if n is in A060645. The terms of A060645 are half the value of alternate even Fibonacci numbers.
%C A295282 More specifically, for k > 0: F(3k) is an even Fibonacci number, F(3k+1) is odd and a(F(3k)/2) = F(3k+1)/2 + 1/2; whereas A007067(F(6k+3)/2) = F(6k+4)/2 + 1/2, but A007067(F(6k)/2) = F(6k+1)/2 - 1/2.
%F A295282 a(n) = (m+n) > n so as to minimize (max((m+n)/n, n/m) / min((m+n)/n, n/m)).
%F A295282 a(n+1) = a(n) + 2 - floor((a(n)+2) * (a(n)+1-n) * (a(n)+1) * (a(n)-n) / (n+1)^4), with a(0) = 0 for the purpose of this calculation.

%e A295282 For n = 4:
%e A295282 if a(4) = 5, the matching ratios would be a(4):4 = 5:4 and 4:(a(4)-4) = 4:1, with the difference between them (larger divided by smaller) = (4/1) / (5/4) = 16/5 = 3.2;
%e A295282 if a(4) = 6, ratios would be 6:4 and 4:2, with difference = (4/2) / (6/4) = 16/12 = 1.333...;
%e A295282 if a(4) = 7, ratios would be 7:4 and 4:3, with difference = (7/4) / (4/3) = 21/16 = 1.3125;
%e A295282 if a(4) = 8, ratios would be 8:4 and 4:4, with difference = (8/4) / (4/4) = 32/16 = 2.0.
%e A295282 Any larger value for a(4) would give a difference between the ratios that exceeded 2.0, so a(4) = 7, as this achieves the minimum difference.
