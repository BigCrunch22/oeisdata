%N A252707 "Smallest interesting" sequence such that each term has as many digits as the previous term's value.
%C A252707 Using 2 as the first term yields the "smallest interesting" sequence with this property. Starting with the value 1 yields the sequence 1, 1, 1, ... and starting with 3 yields a sequence that grows faster (3, 100, 10^99, ...).
%C A252707 The next term is too large to include. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jun 20 2017
%F A252707 a(1) = 2, a(n) = 10^(a(n-1) - 1).
