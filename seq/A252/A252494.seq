%N A252494 Numbers n such that all prime factors of n and n+1 are <= 11. (Related to the abc conjecture.)
%C A252494 This sequence is complete by a theorem of Stormer, cf. A002071.
%C A252494 This is the 5th row of the table A138180. It has 40=A002071(5)=A145604(1)+...+ A145604(5) terms and ends with A002072(5)=9800. It is the union of all terms in rows 1 through 5 of the table A145605.
%C A252494 This is a subsequence of A252493, and contains A085152 and A085153 as subsequences.
