%N A252592 a(n) = number of new distinct proper angles with vertex and legs on grid points in an n X n square grid that were not found in an (n-1) X (n-1) square grid.
%C A252592 First differences of A252591.
%C A252592 The average of the number of distinct angles added by adding six rows and columns to the grid is very nearly a constant times the average grid side cubed. That is, sum_{k=0..5} a(n+k)/6 is close to C*(n+5/2)^3.
%C A252592 a(n)/n^3 is markedly larger for (n-1) prime than for (n-1) composite.
%e A252592 a(2) is 2, since no angles can be formed on a single point, while 90- and 45-degree angles can be formed on a 2 X 2 grid. a(3) is 8, since adding those 5 new points to make a 3 X 3 grid allows forming 8 additional angles.
%Y A252592 Cf. A252591.
%K A252592 nonn
