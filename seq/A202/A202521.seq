%N A202521 Number of digits up to the end of the next prime in the sequence.
%C A202521 Draw a vertical line after each prime in the sequence. The terms of the sequence give the number of digits between the vertical lines. This is the lexicographically earliest sequence (for the next term always use the least number not yet in the sequence not leading to a contradiction) with this property. Since this allows it to "fill up" with small numbers, the sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.
