%N A202805 a(n) is the largest k in an n_nacci(k) sequence (Fibonacci(k) for n=2, tribonacci(k) for n=3, etc.) such that n_nacci(k) >= 2^(k-n-1).
%C A202805 All n_nacci sequences whose first n-1 terms are zeros followed by 1 are "complete" (sic) sequences. As n increases, the terms n+1,...,2n are 1,2,...,2^n (ascending powers of 2). In the limit as n tends to infinity the n_nacci sequence after an initial infinite set of zeros followed by 1 has successive terms of increasing powers of 2. This limiting sequence is the most minimal complete sequence. Consequently for each n_nacci(k) sequence there must be a largest k where n_nacci(k) >= 2^(k-n-1).
%H A202805 Wikipedia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_sequence">"Complete" sequence</a>. [Wikipedia calls a sequence "complete" (sic) if every positive integer is a sum of distinct terms. This name is extremely misleading and should be avoided. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, May 20 2023]
%F A202805 a(n) = (greatest term of n_nacci(k)) >= 2^(k-n-1).
%e A202805 For n=3, the tribonacci sequence is 0,0,1,1,2,4,7,...,149,274,504,... and the 13th term is 504 < 512 so a(n)=12 because 274 is greatest term >= 2^(12-3-1) = 256.
