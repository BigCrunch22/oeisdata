%N A202140 Size of the largest semigroup generated by two n X n Boolean matrices.
%C A202140 Of course, the matrices are multiplied using "Boolean matrix multiplication", which is not the same as multiplication over GF(2).  It is known that a(5) >= 6732481, as evidenced by the matrices [[0,0,0,0,1],[1,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0]] and [[0,0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0,1]].

%e A202140 For n = 2 the maximum order is 11, generated (for example) by the two matrices [[0,0],[0,1]] and [[1,1],[1,0]].
%e A202140 For n = 3 the maximum 175 is achieved by (for example) by the two matrices [[0,0,1],[1,0,0],[0,1,0]] and [[0,0,1],[0,1,0],[1,0,1]].
%e A202140 For n = 4 the maximum 15689 is achieved by (for example) by the two matrices [[0,0,0,1],[0,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[1,0,0,0]] and [[0,0,0,1],[0,0,1,0],[1,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0]].
