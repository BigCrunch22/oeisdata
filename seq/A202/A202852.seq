%N A202852 Matula-Goebel numbers of rooted trees with no perfect matching and such that 2 is an eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix.
%C A202852 It is known that 2 is an eigenvalue of the Laplacian of any tree with a perfect matching (see the Ming & Zhang reference, Theorem 2).
%C A202852 The Matula-Goebel number of a rooted tree can be defined in the following recursive manner: to the one-vertex tree there corresponds the number 1; to a tree T with root degree 1 there corresponds the t-th prime number, where t is the Matula-Goebel number of the tree obtained from T by deleting the edge emanating from the root; to a tree T with root degree m>=2 there corresponds the product of the Matula-Goebel numbers of the m branches of T.

%e A202852 The numbers 343, 908, and 3209 are in the sequence; they are the rooted trees obtained from the tree of Fig. 2 in the Fan reference by taking the root at different vertices. The tree has no perfect matching because it has 2 leaves with the same parent. Its Laplacian matrix has characteristic polynomial x(x-2)(x-5)(x-1)^3*(x^2 - 4x + 1)^2.
