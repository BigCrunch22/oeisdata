%N A202273 Positive integers m in increasing order determined by these rules: a(1) = 1, for n>=1,  if m is in the sequence then also are numbers h such that sigma(h) = 3m.
%C A202273 Sequence is finite with 54 terms.
%e A202273 m=1, 3m=3, sigma(h)=3 for h=2; number 2 is in sequence.
%e A202273 m=2, 3m=6, sigma(h)=6 for h=5; number 5 is in sequence.
%e A202273 m=5, 3m=15, sigma(h)=15 for h=8; number 8 is in sequence.
%e A202273 m=8, 3m=24, sigma(h)=24 for h=14,15,23; numbers 14,15,23 are in sequence.
