%N A202274  Positive integers m in increasing order determined by these rules: a(1) = 1, for n>=1,  if m is in the sequence then also are numbers h such that sigma(h) = 4m-1.
%C A202274  If 31 is only number h of form 2^k-1 for any k>=1 such that sigma(x) = h has solution for more than one value of x then a(n) is union number 25 with A000079 (powers of 2).
%e A202274  m=1, 4m-1=3, sigma(h)=3 for h=2; number 2 is in sequence.
%e A202274 m=2, 4m-1=7, sigma(h)=7 for h=4; number 4 is in sequence.
%e A202274 m=4, 4m-1=15, sigma(h)=15 for h=8; number 8 is in sequence.
%e A202274 m=8, 4m-1=31, sigma(h)=31 for h=16 and 25; numbers 16 and 25 are in sequence.
