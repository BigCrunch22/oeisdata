%N A202274 Numbers k for which sigma(k) = 2^m - 1 for some m.
%C A202274 Original definition, now conjectural, is "Positive integers m in increasing order determined by these rules: a(1) = 1, for n>=1, if m is in the sequence then also are numbers h such that sigma(h) = 4m-1". This is certainly equal to the new definition if 25 is the only term that is not a power of 2, as there is no x such that sigma(x) = 99 = 4*25-1. - _Antti Karttunen_, Dec 13 2024
%C A202274 If 31 is only number h of form 2^k-1 for any k>=1 such that sigma(x) = h has solution for more than one value of x then a(n) is union number 25 with A000079 (powers of 2).
%C A202274 Numbers k such that A000203(k) is in A000225. If Goormaghtigh conjecture is valid, then it is certain that 25 is the only odd prime power (after 1) in this sequence. - _Antti Karttunen_, Dec 13 2024
