%N A202998 Previous integer to m^2/n where m is the next odd prime after n (n excluded).
%C A202998 It is conjectured by Michael B Rees (Dec 2011) that for any n > 0, A110835(n) >= a(n)>=n. The Sierpinski conjecture states that: "For any n >= 2 and any k such that 1 < k <= n there exists a prime number between (k-1)*n and k*n (inclusively)". Rees has conjectured that: "For any n >= 1 and any k such that 1 < k < m^2/n where m is the next odd prime after n (n excluded), there exists a prime number between (k-1)*n and k*n (inclusively)".

%F A202998 a(n) = previousinteger(nextprime(n)^2/n) where the nextprime(n) excludes n and where previousinteger(i) gives i-1 when i is an integer.
%e A202998 For n=5, a(5)=9. Thus there is at least one prime between any two terms (5 excluded) in the arithmetic progression 5,10,....,45. Note that the progression continues to 5*A110835(5)=90 before there is no prime between 90 and 95. So A110835(5)=18 and 18>=9>=5.
