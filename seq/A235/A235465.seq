%N A235465 Primes whose base-8 representation also is the base-2 representation of a prime.
%C A235465 This sequence is part of the two-dimensional array of sequences based on this same idea for any two different bases b, c > 1. Sequence A235265 and A235266 are the most elementary ones in this list. Sequences A089971, A089981 and A090707 through A090721, and sequences A065720 - A065727, follow the same idea with one base equal to 10.
%C A235465 For further motivation and cross-references, see sequence A235265 which is the main entry for this whole family of sequences.
%C A235465 When the smaller base is b=2 such that only digits 0 and 1 are allowed, these are primes that are the sum of distinct powers of the larger base, here c=8, thus a subsequence of A077722.

%e A235465 73 = 111_8 and 111_2 = 7 are both prime, so 73 is a term.
