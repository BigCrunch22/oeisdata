%N A235368 The smallest number with n representations of the form A*B^A with A, B > 1.
%C A235368 Call a number of the form A*B^A, A&B>1 an ABA number. Then a(n) is the smallest ABA number with n representations of this form.
%C A235368 a(n) exists for every n. For example, a(4) <= k = 2^105*3^70*5^126*7^120, where k (a 255-digit number) has 4 representations with A = 2, 3, 5, and 7. - _Giovanni Resta_, Jan 09 2014
%C A235368 It seems economical to find solutions where A = 2 and A = 8 both work, which is possible even though 2 and 8 are not coprime. As an example, 2^75*3^40*5^96 works for A = 2, 8, 3, 5 showing that a(4) <= 2^75*3^40*5^96 (a 109-digit number), improving the a(4) bound from previous comment. - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Oct 29 2023
