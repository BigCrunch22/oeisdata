%N A235464 Primes whose base-7 representation also is the base-2 representation of a prime.
%C A235464 This sequence is part of the two-dimensional array of sequences based on this same idea for any two different bases b, c > 1. Sequence A235265 and A235266 are the most elementary ones in this list. Sequences A089971, A089981 and A090707 through A090721, and sequences A065720 - A065727, follow the same idea with one base equal to 10.
%C A235464 For further motivation and cross-references, see sequence A235265 which is the main entry for this whole family of sequences.
%C A235464 When the smaller base is b=2 such that only digits 0 and 1 are allowed, these are primes that are the sum of distinct powers of the larger base, here c=7, thus a subsequence of A077721.

%e A235464 7 = 10_7 and 10_2 = 2 are both prime, so 7 is a term.
%e A235464 2801 = 11111_7 and 11111_2 = 31 are both prime, so 2801 is a term.
