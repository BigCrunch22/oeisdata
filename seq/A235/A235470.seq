%N A235470 Primes whose base-7 representation also is the base-3 representation of a prime.
%C A235470 This sequence is part of the two-dimensional array of sequences based on this same idea for any two different bases b, c > 1. Sequence A235265 and A235266 are the most elementary ones in this list. Sequences A089971, A089981 and A090707 through A090721, and sequences A065720 - A065727, follow the same idea with one base equal to 10.
%C A235470 For further motivation and cross-references, see sequence A235265 which is the main entry for this whole family of sequences.
%C A235470 Since the trailing digit of the base-7 expansion must (like all others) be less than 3, this is a subsequence of A045381.
