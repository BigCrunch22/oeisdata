%N A235987 a(n) = |{0 < k < n: p = prime(k) + phi(n-k) is a Sophie prime having 2 as a primitive root}|.
%C A235987 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 37.
%C A235987 (ii) For any integer n > 7, there is a positive integer k < n such that p = phi(k) + phi(n-k)/2 - 1 is a prime having 2 as a primitive root.
%C A235987 Part (i) of the conjecture implies that there are infinitely many Sophie Germain primes p having 2 as a primitive root modulo p.
%C A235987 We also have some other similar conjectures.

%e A235987 a(10) = 1 since prime(3) + phi(7) = 5 + 6 = 11 is a Sophie prime and 2 is a primitive root modulo 11.
%e A235987 a(79) = 1 since prime(19) + phi(60) = 67 + 16 = 83 is a Sophie Germain prime and 2 is a primitive root modulo 83.
