%N A235462 Primes whose base-5 representation also is the base-2 representation of a prime.
%C A235462 This sequence is part of the two-dimensional array of sequences based on this same idea for any two different bases b, c > 1. Sequence A235265 and A235266 are the most elementary ones in this list. Sequences A089971, A089981 and A090707 through A090721, and sequences A065720 - A065727, follow the same idea with one base equal to 10.
%C A235462 For further motivation and cross-references, see sequence A235265 which is he main entry for this whole family of sequences.
%C A235462 When the smaller base is b=2 such that only digits 0 and 1 are allowed, these are primes that are the sum of distinct powers of the larger base, here c=5, thus a subsequence of A077719.
