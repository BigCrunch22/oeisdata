%N A235230 Integer radii of circles tiled by square tiles such that the ratio of uncut tiles to cut tiles is an integer and four square tiles meet at the center of the circle.
%C A235230 It is my conjecture that there are an infinite number of solutions and that they occur by chance, accounting for the widening gaps between valid answers as the number of digits for the sums of tiles increases.
%C A235230 The inspiration for this problem came from Enigma #1686 of the New Scientist Magazine.
%C A235230 The values involved are the following {a(n), #uncut, cut, ratio} : {1, 0, 4, 0}, {6, 88, 44, 2}, {15, 648, 108, 6}, {364, 414700, 2900, 143}, {585, 1072764, 4644, 231}, {5052, 80161536, 40404, 1984}, {9573, 287864220, 76580, 3759},{191714, 115466138200, 1533700, 75286}, {13682428, 588133849050724, 109459412, 5373077}. No further terms up to 15*10^6. - _Giovanni Resta_, Jan 06 2014
