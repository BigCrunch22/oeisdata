%N A235598 Begin with a(0) = 3. Let a(n) for n > 0 be the smallest positive integer not yet in the sequence which forms part of a Pythagorean triple when paired with a(n-1).
%C A235598 Is the sequence infinite?  Can it "paint itself into a corner" at any point? Note that picking any starting point >= 5 seems to lead to a finite sequence ending in 5,3,4. For example, starting with 6 we get 6,8,10,24,7,25,15,9,12,5,3,4, stop (A235599).
%C A235598 By beginning with 3 or 4, we make sure that the 5,3,4 dead-end is never available.
%C A235598 If infinite, is it a permutation of the integers >= 3? This seems likely.  Proving it doesn't seem easy though.
%C A235598 Comment from _Jim Nastos_, Dec 30 2013: Your question about whether the sequence can 'paint itself into a corner' is essentially asking if the Pythagorean graph has a Hamiltonian path. As far as I know, the questions in the Cooper-Poirel paper (see link) are still unanswered. They ask whether the graph is k-colorable with a finite k, or whether it is even connected (sort of equivalent to your question of whether it is a permutation of the integers >=3).
%C A235598 Lars Blomberg has computed the sequence out to 3 million terms without finding a dead end.
