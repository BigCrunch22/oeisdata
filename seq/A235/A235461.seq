%N A235461 Primes whose base-4 representation also is the base 2-representation of a prime.
%C A235461 This sequence is part of the two-dimensional array of sequences based on this same idea for any two different bases b, c > 1. Sequence A235265 and A235266 are the most elementary ones in this list. Sequences A089971, A089981 and A090707 through A090721, and sequences A065720 - A065727, follow the same idea with one base equal to 10.
%C A235461 For further motivation and cross-references, see sequence A235265 which is the main entry for this whole family of sequences.
%C A235461 When the smaller base is b=2 such that only digits 0 and 1 are allowed, these are primes that are the sum of distinct powers of the larger base, here c=4, thus a subsequence of A077718 and therefore also of A000695, the Moser-de Bruijn sequence.
%H A235461 M. F. Hasler, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10IM7fcAbB2tqRGuwfGvuEGUzD_IXbgXPDK0tfxN4M3o/pub">Primes whose base c expansion is also the base b expansion of a prime</a>
%e A235461 5 = 11_4 and 11_2 = 3 are both prime, so 5 is a term.
%e A235461 17 = 101_4 and 101_2 = 5 are both prime, so 17 is a term.
