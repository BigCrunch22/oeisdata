%N A235476 Primes whose base-2 representation also is the base-6 representation of a prime.
%C A235476 This sequence is part of a two-dimensional array of sequences, given in the LINK, based on this same idea for any two different bases b, c > 1. Sequence A235265 and A235266 are the most elementary ones in this list. Sequences A089971, A089981 and A090707 through A090721, and sequences A065720 - A065727, follow the same idea with one base equal to 10.
%C A235476 For further motivation and cross-references, see sequence A235265 which is the main entry for this whole family of sequences.
