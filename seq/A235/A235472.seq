%N A235472 Primes whose base-9 representation also is the base-3 representation of a prime.
%C A235472 This sequence is part of the two-dimensional array of sequences based on this same idea for any two different bases b, c > 1. Sequence A235265 and A235266 are the most elementary ones in this list. Sequences A089971, A089981 and A090707 through A090721, and sequences A065720 - A065727, follow the same idea with one base equal to 10.
%C A235472 For further motivation and cross-references, see sequence A235265 which is the main entry for this whole family of sequences.
%C A235472 Since all digits of the base 9 expansion are less than 3, this is a subsequence of A037314.
