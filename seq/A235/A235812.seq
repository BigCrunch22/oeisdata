%N A235812 a(n) is the start of the earliest run of n numbers such that the sum of their digits is equal to the sum of the digits of their prime factors.
%C A235812 This sequence takes into account both primes and Smith numbers (A006753).
%C A235812 a(10) > 5*10^12.
%H A235812 C. Rivera, <a href="http://www.primepuzzles.net/puzzles/puzz_247.htm"> Puzzle 247. Consecutive Smith numbers</a>
%e A235812 The four numbers 2, 3, 4, 5 are either prime (2, 3, 5) or Smith (4) numbers. In any case, the sum of their digits is equal to the sum of their prime factors (counted with multiplicity), hence a(1) = a(2) = a(3) = a(4) = 2.
