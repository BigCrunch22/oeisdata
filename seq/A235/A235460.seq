%N A235460 a(1)=2. For n>1, assume a(n-1) has decimal expansion abcdefghij (with at most ten digits, where some of j,i,h, ... may be missing). Then a(n) = sum 11...1 (with a 1's) + 22...2 (with b 2's) + 33...3 (with c 3's) + ...
%C A235460 See A235400 for the analogous sequence where we number the digits starting with 9 at the rightmost digit.

%e A235460 2 means two 1's = 11; 11 means one 1 + one 2 = 3; 3 means 111; 111 means 1+2+3 = 6; 6 means 111111 = 1+2+3+4+5+6 = 21; 21 means 11+2 = 13; etc.
