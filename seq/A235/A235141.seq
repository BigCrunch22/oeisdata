%N A235141 First differences of A234300.
%C A235141 A geometric interpretation of the sequence is the number of added or subtracted squares along the edge of (not completely within) an origin centered circle in a quadrant of a Cartesian grid as the radius increases.  The number of squares increase or decrease when the radius squared changes from being exactly on a corner of a square (r^2 = m^2+n^2)  to the open interval between corners given by (m^2+n^2,(m+1)^2+(n+1)^2).  The square radii that correspond to corners are given by A001481, so each a(n) corresponds to the radius changing from a point to an element of an open set bounded by adjacent elements of A001481.
%C A235141 a(n) is 0 when the radius squared increases from the open interval less than a perfect square to the perfect square itself (corresponding to a radius that intersects the x and y axes at an integer), see below for example.
%C A235141 a(n) is odd when the square radius changes to or from an integer which is twice a square integer (on a corner on the y= x line), see below for example.

%F A235141 a(n) = A234300(n) - A234300(n-1).
%e A235141 a(6) = 0 corresponding to a change of square radius from the open interval (3,4) to 4, i.e., the interval (A001481(3),A001481(4)) to A001481(4).
%e A235141 a(48) and a(49) are odd,  corresponding to the transition from (49,50) to 50 and 50 to (50,52) respectively (r = 5).
%Y A235141 First differences of A234300.
%Y A235141 Cf. A001481 (see comments).
