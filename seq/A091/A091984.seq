%N A091984 Number of steps required for initial p = 10^n to reach 1 in the recurrence p = floor(Li(p)).
%C A091984 The number of steps for the recurrence in this sequence stopping at 1 compares closely to the steps in the pi(n) recurrence stopping at 0. If we define Li(1) = 0 and allow that step then A(using Li seq#) - A(using pi seq#) = 1 for n <=13. So one may conjecture the steps in the Li method is always 1 greater than the steps in the pi method. Question is can the difference be greater than 1? For the largest value allowed in the link (3*10^13) A(Li) = 17 (assuming L1(1)= 0) and n=13 A(pi) = 16 from Booker so the difference = 1 as before.

%F A091984 Li(n) = logarithmic integral = integral(x=2..n, dx/log(x)). This gives a very good approximation to the number of primes less than or equal to n. By repeating n=Li(n), n will reach 1 in a finite number of steps.
%e A091984 Li(100) = 30
%e A091984 Li(30) = 13
%e A091984 Li(13) = 7
%e A091984 Li(7) = 4
%e A091984 Li(4) = 2
%e A091984 Li(2) = 1
%e A091984 Total steps to reach 1 = 6. Thus 6 is the 2nd entry in the sequence corresponding to n=2.
