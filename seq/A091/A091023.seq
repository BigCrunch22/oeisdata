%N A091023 a(1)=1; for n >= 2, set a(n)=m, where n is the smallest unassigned index with exactly m-1 unassigned indices still remaining between m and m-1.
%C A091023 Suggested by _Leroy Quet_ in SeqFan memo 3602 on Feb 16 2004, where he gave the terms with values 1-16, with a(6) the first unassigned term.
%C A091023 Considering the number of unassigned indices to the left of the current position gives an equivalent sequence, A091068, which is easier to analyze. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 23 2004

%e A091023 After 1 has been assigned to a(1), the first unassigned term that is one term away from 1 is a(2), so a(2)=2;
%e A091023 the first unassigned term that is two terms away from 2 is a(4), so a(4)=3;
%e A091023 the first unassigned term that is 3 terms away from 3 is a(7), so a(7)=4;
%e A091023 the first unassigned term that is 4 terms away from 4 is a(11), so a(11)=5;
%e A091023 at this point we have 1,2,*,3,*,*,4,*,*,*,5,..., where * indicates a term to which a value has not yet been assigned.
%e A091023 The next value to assign is 6 which must be assigned to the first term of the sequence that is 5 terms away from a(11)=5; since a(5) has not yet been assigned a value and since at this point 5 terms with unassigned values lie between a(5) and a(11), we must assign 6 to a(5), i.e., a(5)=6.
