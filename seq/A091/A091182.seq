%N A091182 Number of ways to write n = x + y (x >= y > 0) with xy - 1 and xy + 1 both prime.
%C A091182 From _Zhi-Wei Sun_, Nov 27 2012: (Start)
%C A091182 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 3120. This has been verified for n up to 5*10^7.
%C A091182 Note that if x >= y > 0 and x+y = n then n-1 = x+y-1 <= xy <= ((x+y)/2)^2 = n^2/4. So the conjecture implies that there are infinitely many twin primes.
%C A091182 For n=4,5,...,3120 we can write n = x+y (x >= y > 0) with xy-1 prime.
%C A091182 For each positive integer n <= 3120 different from 1,6,30,54, we can write n = x+y (x >= y > 0) with xy+1 prime.
%C A091182 More generally, we have the following conjecture: Let m be any positive integer. If n is sufficiently large and (m-1)n is even, then we can write n as x+y, where x and y are positive integers with xy-m and xy+m both prime. This general conjecture implies that for any positive even integer d there are infinitely many primes p and q with difference d. (End)
