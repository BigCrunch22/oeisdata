%N A091378 Triangle read by rows: T(m,n) = number of weak factorization systems (trivial Quillen model structures) on the poset of order-preserving maps from [m] to [n+1] (where [m] denotes the total order on m objects), viewed as a category.
%C A091378 Specifying a weak factorization system on a poset category is equivalent to specifying a set of morphisms that includes all identity morphisms and is closed under composition and pullback.

%F A091378 T(m, n) = T(n, m) because the corresponding categories are isomorphic. T(0, n) = T(n, 0) = 1. T(1, n) = T(n, 1) = C(n+1) the (n+1)st Catalan number (A000108).
%e A091378 T(1, 2) = 5:  the category is the total order on three objects:  it has three nonidentity morphisms a, b, c satisfying the relation ba = c.  Of the 8 possible sets of morphisms, {a, b} is not closed under composition and {c}, {b, c} are not closed under pullback since a is a pullback of c.  The other 5 sets generate weak factorization systems.
%e A091378 See A092450 for an example computing weak factorization systems on a category which is not a total order.
