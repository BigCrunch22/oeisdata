%N A091451 Array T(n,k) read by antidiagonals: (row 0)=squares, (row 1)={numbers m for which the simple continued fraction (CF) of sqrt(m) has period length 1; once (row n) is defined, let (row n+1) begin with the least positive integer not already in a row and let the rest of (row n+1) be the other k's for which CF(sqrt(k)) has the same period length.
%C A091451 A permutation of the positive integers.
%e A091451 7 is the least positive integer not in rows 0,1,2, so 7=T(3,0); the period length of sqrt(7) is 4, as is the case with T(3,1)=14, T(3,2)=23, etc.
