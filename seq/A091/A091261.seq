%N A091261 Number of orthogonal mates for the cyclic Latin squares of odd order.
%C A091261 It is well known that the Cayley table of the cyclic group of order n has no orthogonal mate whenever n is even. This sequence reports the number of standardized orthogonal mates when n is odd, starting at n=3 (the case n=1 being meaningless). The word "standardized" refers to the fact that we only count mates which have their first row in natural order, since relabeling of the symbols in the orthogonal mate does not affect its defining property.
