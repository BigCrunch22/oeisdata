%N A091449 Array T(n,k) read by antidiagonals, where row n is the increasing sequence of numbers k for which the simple continued fraction of sqrt(k) has period n.
%C A091449 A permutation of the positive integers.
%e A091449 The least n for which CF(sqrt(n)) has period of length 4 is n=7, with CF=[2;1,1,1,4,1,1,1,4,1,1,1,4,...]; thus T(3,0)=7.
%e A091449 [The array T(n,k) is indexed by n=0,1,2,3,..., k=0,1,2,3... .]
%e A091449 Row 0 consists of squares: 1,4,9,...
