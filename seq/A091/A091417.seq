%N A091417 Integers n which are not the difference of 2 integers A and B where A is less than or equal to n such that AB+1 and AB-1 are both primes. In other words, the product A*B cannot be the middle integer of a twin prime pair.
%C A091417 Sequence may be finite. Next term after 1890 if it exists must be greater than 867750.
%e A091417 8 is a member: 8 is the difference between these pairs of integers: (9-1) (10-2) (11-3) (12-4) (13-5) (14-6) (15-7) (16-8). Their products (9*1) (10*2), etc. plus and minus 1 are not primes and therefore the products cannot be the middle integers of twin prime sets.
