%N A091850 a(1) = 1; a(n) is the smallest positive integer not already in the sequence such that Sum_{k=1..n} k*a(k) is a prime.

%C A091850 Comment from Fred Helenius: Every positive integer up to 82 appears in the first 100 terms; everything up to 922 appears in the first 1000. Apart from a(1), odd-indexed terms must be even; even-indexed terms are occasionally even as well, so the odd values tend to arrive late.
