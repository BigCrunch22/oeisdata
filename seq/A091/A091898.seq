%N A091898 Numbers that change from composite to prime or vice versa for at least one permutation of their digits.
%C A091898 This is actually a subsequence of the complement of A091897, the union of A003459 and A067012: This sequence contains no powers of 10 (A011557) as 1 is not prime.
%C A091898 Clearly also no repdigit number (A010785) is a term nor is any number with only even digits (except for 20,200,2000,...) nor is any number divisible by 3 (except for 30,300,3000,...). Among other primes, this sequence does include all primes p > 5 which contain at least one of the digits 0,2,4,5,6,8.
%e A091898 14=2*7 (composite) is a term as a permutation of its digits gives 41 (prime).
%e A091898 Hence 41 is also a term. 19 (prime) is a term as 91=7*13 (composite). Thus 91
%e A091898 is also a term. 130=2*5*13 (composite) is a term (even though the permutation
%e A091898 310=2*5*31 is also composite) because another permutation (0)13 (prime) exists
%e A091898 (dropping the leading 0). 13, however, is not a term as 31 is also prime (13
%e A091898 and 31 are members of A003459).
%Y A091898 Cf. A003459 (absolute primes), A067012 ('absolute composites'), A091897 (union of A003459 and A067012), A010785 (repdigit numbers).
