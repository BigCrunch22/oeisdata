%N A091063 Triangle, read by rows, such that the initial terms of the binomial transform of the n-th row forms the n-th row of triangle A059438 transposed (permutations of [1..n] with k components).
%C A091063 The main diagonal equals A075834 shift 1 place left; subsequent diagonals of this triangle are self-convolutions of the main diagonal. A075834 has the property that the n-th term of the n-th self-convolution of A075834 equals n!. The first (n+1) terms of the binomial transform of the n-th row forms the n-th row of triangle A059438 transposed, which has row sums equal to the factorials. A059438 is also formed from the self-convolutions of its main diagonal (A003319).
