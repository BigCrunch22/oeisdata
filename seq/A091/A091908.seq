%N A091908 Number of interior intersection points made by the straight line segments connecting the edges of an equilateral triangle with the n-1 points resulting from a subdivision of the sides into n equal pieces, counting coinciding intersection points only once.
%C A091908 In a drawing the distinction between simple and multiple intersection points may be difficult due to near-coincidences. E.g. there are no coincident intersections for n=7.
%C A091908 Note that 3 divides a(2k)-1 and a(2k+1). - _T. D. Noe_, Jun 29 2005
%C A091908 The interior intersection points only can be the result of the concurrency of 2 or 3 segments by construction. It is easy to see that the total number of 2-intersections N2 is 3*(n-1)^2 (which includes every 3-intersection as two 2-intersections) by symmetry. But we are interested in excluding the concurrency of more than 2. By Ceva's theorem necessary and sufficient condition for 3 concurrent segments that connect the edges with the opposite side, the number of 3-intersections N3 is the same as the number of (i,j,k) belonging to [1,n-1]x[1,n-1]x[1,n-1] such that (i/(n-i))*(j/(n-j))*(k/(n-k))=1. Thus the terms a(n)=N2-2*N3. - Herman Jamke (hermanjamke(AT)fastmail.fm), Oct 26 2006
%C A091908 If n is even then a(n) < 3*(n-1)^2; if n is odd then a(n) = 3*(n-1)^2 except for n in A332378. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Feb 14 2020

%e A091908 a(3)=12 because the 3*2 line segments intersect each other in 12 distinct points (see pictures given at link)
%e A091908 a(4)=13 because the 27 intersections form 6 two line intersection points and 7 three line intersection points.
