%N A091862 a(n) = 1 if the sum of all exponents of the prime-factorization of n has no carries when summed in base 2, or a(n) = 0 if there are any carries.

%e A091862 a(12) = 1 because 12 = 2^2 *3^1 and, in base 2, 2 = '10', 1 = '1' and '10' and '1' have their ones in different positions. But a(24) = 0 because 24 = 2^3 *3^1 and in base 2 3 = '11', 1 = '1', which both share a rightmost one.
