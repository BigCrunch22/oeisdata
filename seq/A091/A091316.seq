%N A091316 a(1)=1, a(2)=2, then a(a(1)+a(2)+...+a(k))=a(k), fill in any undefined places with the rule a(n+1)=a(n)+1.
%F A091316 Is sum(k=1, n, a(k)) asymptotic to c*n*log(n)*log(log(n)) with c=0.6...?
%e A091316 a(a(1)+a(2))=a(2) therefore a(3)=a(2)=2. a(a(1)+a(2)+a(3))=a(3) therefore a(5)=2. So a(4) is undefined but from the rule a(4)=a(3)+1=3.
