%N A091857 Beginning with 1, (a(2n-1),a(2n)) = 1, (a(2n),a(2n+1))>1; a(n) is smallest value not yet used that makes this true.
%C A091857 It seems that for n>1, a(2n-1) is always even, which forces a(2n) to be odd. Together, these prevent any further powers of 2 from appearing in the sequence. In fact, it appears that a(2n+1) is always either less than a(2n) or equal to a(2n) + the least prime factor of a(2n); and very rarely is a(2n) anything other than the smallest odd number not yet used (the first instance for n>1 is a(96) = 97 instead of 95). - _Franklin T.
