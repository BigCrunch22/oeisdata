%N A074157 Smallest multiple of n which uses no digits of n, or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A074157 For numbers n of the form 10k, of the form 10k+5 with a zero somewhere, and those using all 10 digits, a(n) = 0.
%C A074157 Are there numbers using 8 of the 9 nonzero digits for which a(n) is nonzero? If so, what is the smallest such number?
%C A074157 Yes, such numbers do exist. For example, a(12345679) = 888888888. Moreover, it is known that every integer has a nonzero multiple whose digits consist only of zeros and ones. To see this, given a natural number n, consider the set {1,11,111,…,11…1}, where the last number has (n + 1) digits. By the pigeonhole principle, there are two numbers in this set that are congruent mod n, say p an q, with p > q. Thus, (p - q) is a multiple of n whose digits consist only of zeros and ones. The smallest 8-digit number using the digits from 1 to 9 is 12345678. If k is an integer such that 12345678*k consists only of zeros and ones, then 12345678*k*9 will be composed of zeros and nines, meaning it has no digits in common with 12345678. Therefore, the smallest integer is n = 12345678. - _Gonzalo Martínez_, Dec 12 2024
