%N A074145 a(1) = 1; for n>1, a(n) is the smallest previously unused natural number such that a(n) divides the sum of next a(n) terms.
%C A074145 4 comes after 5 hence the next terms after 5 are so chosen that the property holds for 4 as well.
%C A074145 The next term a(49) does not exist, so there are no more terms. This is because a(25)=24 and a(27)=22 both must divide a(49). Assuming that a(49)=x, this leads to 867+x=24a and 824+x=22b for some integers a and b. Subtracting, we get 43=24a-22b, which is a contradiction. - _John W. Layman_, Jul 29 2003
%e A074145 5 divides the sum (4 + 6 +7 +8 + 15) of the next five terms and 4 does so for (6+7+8+15).
