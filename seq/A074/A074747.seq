%N A074747 Largest difference between consecutive anti-divisors of n (ordered by size).
%C A074747 For 2<=k<n and k even, k is an anti-divisor of n iff n==k/2 (mod k) for 2<=k<n and k odd, k is an anti-divisor of n iff either n==(k-1)/2 (mod k) or n==(k+1)/2 (mod k) when there are fewer than 2 anti-divisors of n, a(n) = 0. - Weston Markham (weston.markham(AT)gmail.com), May 22 2005
%C A074747 See A066272 for definition of anti-divisor.
