%N A074873 Friendly numbers (see A074902) such that sigma(n) is not friendly.
%C A074873 I do not know how rigorously these numbers have been established. It is possible there are missing terms - see A074902. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 15 2002
%C A074873 From _Walter Nissen_, May 28 2011: (Start)
%C A074873 Yes; in particular, if perchance 10 should turn out to have a friend, then 10 would be a(0). Also 30 and 40 might possibly be in this sequence.
%C A074873 Numbers without friends are called solitary.
%C A074873 (End)
%e A074873 6 is friendly, but so is sigma(6)=12, so 6 is not in the sequence. 210 is friendly (with 17360 for example), but sigma(210)=576 is not friendly.
