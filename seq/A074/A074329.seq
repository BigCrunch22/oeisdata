%N A074329 n-th highly composite number equals a(n)-th composite number.
%C A074329 Since 1 is taken to be the first highly composite number and the 2nd highly composite is the prime 2, so first 2 terms here were taken to be zero. Definition of A002182 is not precise enough.
%F A074329 a(n)=A002182(n)-A000720[A002182(n)]-1; A002182(m)=A002808[a(m)].
%e A074329 3rd term is 4, the first composite number; the 6th highly composite number is 24, the 14th composite number.
%t A074329 t[x_] := A002182[x]; Table[Part[t, w]-PrimePi[Part[t, w]]-1, {w, 1, Length[t]}]
