%N A074135 Triangle read by rows: for 1 <= k < n, a(n, k) is the least positive integer not already used. a(n, n) is the least positive integer not already used that makes the row sum a multiple of n.
%C A074135 Alternative (but equivalent) definition: In the following square array, numbers (not occurring earlier) are entered like this a(1, 1), a(1, 2), a(2, 1), a(3, 1), a(2, 2), a(1, 3), a(1, 4), a(2, 3), a(3, 2), a(4, 1), a(5, 1), a(4, 2), ... such that the n-th diagonal sum is a multiple of n. 1 2 7 6 18... 4 5 8 14... 3 9 12... 13 11... 10... ... sequence contains terms as they are entered.
