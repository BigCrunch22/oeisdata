%N A074855 Primes p such that all p-t for p/2 < t < p are nonprime, where t is a triangular number.
%C A074855 Next term, if it exists, is greater than 15900000. (Is this sequence finite?) - _Ryan Propper_, May 20 2006
%C A074855 If it exists, a(16) > 5001022933. - _Sean A. Irvine_, Jan 31 2025
%e A074855 29 is in the sequence because the triangular numbers between 14 and 29 are 15, 21, 28 and 29-15 = 14, 29-21 = 8, 29-28 = 1 are all composite.
%e A074855 7 is in the sequence because the only triangular number between 7/2 and 7 is 6 and 7-6 = 1 is not prime. - _Sean A. Irvine_, Jan 31 2025
