%N A074142 Coefficients a(n) of a series connected with the odd primes.
%C A074142 The series reciprocal to the series with coefficients in A005097 has (integer) coefficients with irregular signs and values. In contrast the series reciprocal to the series with coefficients = primes themselves has coefficients (A030018) with alternating signs and regular growth. The radius of convergence (defined from consecutive coefficients ratio) of that series is 0.686777834460.
%F A074142 Sum(a(i)*x^(i-1), (i=1, inf))=1/(1+sum(1/2(p(i)-1)*x^(i-1), i=2, inf)) =1/(1+sum( A005097(i)*x^(i), i=1, inf))
