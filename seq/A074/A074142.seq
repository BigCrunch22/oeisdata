%N A074142 a(n) is the coefficient of x^n in x/(1 + Sum_{k>=1} (1/2)*(prime(k+1) - 1)*x^k).
%C A074142 The series reciprocal to the series with coefficients in A005097 has (integer) coefficients with irregular signs and values. In contrast the series reciprocal to the series with coefficients = primes themselves has coefficients (A030018) with alternating signs and regular growth. The radius of convergence (defined from consecutive coefficients ratio) of that series is 0.686777834460.
%F A074142 G.f.: x / (1 + Sum_{i>=1} A005097(i)*x^i).
