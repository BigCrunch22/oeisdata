%N A074025 Numbers k such that a triplewhist tournament TWh(k) exists.
%C A074025 The present state of knowledge, quoting from Ge (2007), is that a TWh(k) exists iff k == 0 or 1 (mod 4), except for k = 5, 9, 12, 13 and possibly 17.
%C A074025 After 16, the sequence continues 17?, 20, 21, 24, 25, 28, 29, 32, 33, 36, 37, 40, 41, 44, 45, 48, 49, 52, 53, 56, 57, ...

%E A074025 Of course this entry is much too short. But I have included it in the hope that this will encourage someone to settle the question of whether a(5) is 17 or 20 - i.e., does a TWh(17) exist?
