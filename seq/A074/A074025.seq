%N A074025 Numbers k such that a triplewhist tournament TWh(k) exists.
%C A074025 The term a(5) = 99999999999999999999 is a fake, inserted to prevent this sequence from being incorrectly returned by Superseeker. Of course it will be replaced by the correct value, once that is determined.
%C A074025 The present state of knowledge, quoting from Ge & Lam and the link below, is that a TWh(k) exists iff k == 0 or 1 (mod 4), except for k = 5, 9, 12 and possibly excepting k in {17, 57, 65, 69, 77, 85, 93, 117, 129, 153}.
%C A074025 After 16, the sequence continues 17?, 20, 21, 24, 25, 28, 29, 32, 33, 36, 37, 40, 41, 44, 45, 48, 49, 52, 53, 56, 57?, ...

%E A074025 Of course this entry is much too short. But I have included it in the hope that this will encourage someone to settle the question of whether a(5) is 17 or 20 - i.e., does a TWh(17) exist?
