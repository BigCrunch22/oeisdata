%N A074931 Primes p such that 3p is equidistant from consecutive prime twin pairs.
%C A074931 Numbers equidistant from consecutive twins (see A074953) are multiples of 3 and they may be almost primes only of form 3*prime. In the sequence, these primes are given. Also: A001748 (3*prime 2-almost-primes) and A001358 (all 2-almost-primes).
%e A074931 17 is in the sequence because 3 * 17 = 51 is equidistant between {41, 43} and {59, 61}.
%e A074931 19 is not in the sequence because 3 * 19 = 57, which is much closer to {59, 61} than to {41, 43}.
%Y A074931 Cf. A001358, A001748, A074953.
