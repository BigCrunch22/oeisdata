%N A074192 Number of numbers 0 <= m < 10^n which are not the sum of one or more consecutive primes.
%C A074192 If the upper limit is changed to include 10^n, the entries are increased by 1 for n = 3, 4, 5,.. and perhaps others, because 1000, 10000 and 100000 are not sums of consecutive primes, whereas 10=2+3+5 and 100=2+3+5+...+19+23 are. [_R. J. Mathar_, Oct 10 2010]
%C A074192 Based on work of Enoch Haga, Jud McCranie and Felice Russo.
%C A074192 The ratio a(n)/10^n might be converging to 0.52..., it might also be slowly growing to 1, which way is it? - _Daniel Forgues_, Nov 03 2011
