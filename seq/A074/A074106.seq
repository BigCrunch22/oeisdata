%N A074106 a(1)=1; a(n) is the minimal unused odd prime such that the sum a(1)+a(2)+...+a(n) is divisible by n.
%C A074106 Sequence is finite. The sum of the first 9 terms is 135. For the next term to give a sum that is a multiple of 10, the term must itself be divisible by 5. However, the prime 5 has already been used. - _Matthew Conroy_, Aug 28 2002
