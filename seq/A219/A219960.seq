%N A219960 Numbers which do not reach zero under the repeated iteration x -> ceiling(sqrt(x)) * (ceiling(sqrt(x))^2 - x).
%C A219960 Ceiling equivalent of A219303, with somewhat different behavior despite a near-identical iterative process.
%C A219960 Conjecture #1: All numbers under the iteration reach 0 or, like the elements of this sequence, reach a finite loop, and none expand indefinitely to infinity.
%C A219960 Conjecture #2: There are an infinite number of such finite loops, though there is often significant distance between them.
%C A219960 Conjecture #3: There are an infinite number of pairs of consecutive integers in this sequence despite being less abundant than in A219303.

%e A219960 1702 is in this list as 38 iterations return to 1702. Many other numbers reach this loop. 5832 is also in this list and is the smallest member of a different loop.
%e A219960 1703 is _not_ in this list because the iteration runs: 1703 -> 2562 -> 1989 -> 1620 -> 2501 -> 5100 -> 6048 -> 2808 -> 53 -> 88 -> 120 -> 11 -> 20 -> 25 -> 0.
