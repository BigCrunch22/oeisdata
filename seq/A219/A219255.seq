%N A219255 Numbers n for which prime(n) divides at least one sum of two consecutive terms in sequence {f_m(k)}, defined in A224523.
%C A219255 Places of the last elements of runs of the same terms in A224523 are in the sequence. Whether these sequences coincide one to another?
%e A219255 7 is in the sequence, since prime(7)=17 and sequence {f_7(k)} is periodic with period {1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,2,1,3,4,7,11,18}, such that sum of terms 13+21=34 is divisible by 17.
