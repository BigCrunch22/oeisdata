%N A219863 Decimal expansion of 1 - 1/e^2.
%C A219863 Consider a substrate (such as polyvinyl alcohol or in forming the polymer of methyl vinyl ketone) in a "1,3 configuration" in which substituents branching off the substrate can irreversibly join with neighboring substituents unless the neighbor is already joined to its other neighbor. Then this constant is the fraction of unjoined substituents on an infinite substrate.
%C A219863 This also applies to reversible reactions when the rate of forward reaction is much faster than that of backward reaction; see Flory p. 1518 footnote 5. This had "satisfactory accord" with his experimental data using methyl vinyl ketone polymer for which the experimentally-obtained percentage was 0.85.
