%N A219648 The infinite trunk of Zeckendorf beanstalk. The only infinite sequence such that a(n-1) = a(n) - number of 1's in Zeckendorf representation of a(n).
%C A219648 a(n) tells in what number we end in n steps, when we start climbing up the infinite trunk of the "Zeckendorf beanstalk" from its root (zero).
%C A219648 There are many finite sequences such as 0,1,2; 0,1,2,4,5; etc. (see A219649) and as the length increases, so (necessarily) does the similarity to this infinite sequence.
%C A219648 There can be only one infinite trunk in "Zeckendorf beanstalk" as all paths downwards from numbers >= A000045(i) must pass through A000045(i)-1 (i.e. A000071(i)). This provides also a well-defined method to compute the sequence, for example, via a partially reversed version A261076.
%C A219648 See A014417 for the Fibonacci number system representation, also known as Zeckendorf expansion.
