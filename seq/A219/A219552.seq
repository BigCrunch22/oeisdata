%N A219552 First differences of A219303.
%C A219552 Conjecture: 1 appears infinitely often in this sequence (indicating an infinite number of pairs of consecutive integers in the parent sequence).
%C A219552 Observation: Values tend to average around 20 for early terms, though some evidence suggests this average falls slightly much later. It is not clear how the overall average value behaves approaching the limit at infinity.
