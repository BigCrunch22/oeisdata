%N A219330 Number of random selections (with replacement) needed from a normal population to assure a greater than one-half chance that the selected group contains the top 10th percentile individual, top 1st percentile individual, the 0.1 percentile, 0.01 percentile etc...
%C A219330 a(n) is the least number of random selections (with replacement) required that assures a group having at least a 0.5 probability of containing the top 100/(10^n)th percentile individual. Converges toward log(2)*10^n with increasing n.

%F A219330 a(n) = ceiling((log(2))/(log(10^n/(10^n-1)))).
%e A219330 To assure a greater than 1/2 chance of finding an individual with, say, an IQ in the top one out of a thousand or 1/(10^3), you must select at least (with replacement) a(3) = 693 individuals.
