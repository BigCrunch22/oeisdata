%N A219177 Decimal expansion of what appears to be the smallest possible C for which the nearest integer to C^2^n is always prime and starts with 2.
%C A219177 The square of this constant, C^2 = 1.6180339472264..., is very close to the Golden Ratio Phi (A001622).
%C A219177 This constant is about 3% less than Mills's constant, 1.306377883863..., (A051021).
%C A219177 Since there is always a prime between an integer and its square, this constant should satisfy the same criteria as does Mills's constant (A051021).
%C A219177 This constant, C, produces A059785.
