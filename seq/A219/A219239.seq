%N A219239 Double magic numbers (in physics).
%C A219239 For the magic numbers see A018226.
%C A219239 An atomic nucleus is called double magic if Z (number of protons in an atomic nucleus, atomic number) and N (number of neutrons) are both magic numbers. The nucleon or mass number (forget the Z electrons) is A = Z + N.
%C A219239 Each number a(n) is obtained in only one way as a sum of two (possibly equal) magic numbers. Only 28 is magic and double magic.

%F A219239 a(n) is the sum of two numbers from [2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126] (the magic numbers A018226).
%e A219239 Tin-132 is a double magic radionuclide (unstable isotope) with nucleon number A = 132 = a(21), Z = 50 and N = 82. Similarly for tin-100 with Z = N = 50. The stable primordial nuclide barium-132 is not double magic, because it has Z = 56 and N = 76.
