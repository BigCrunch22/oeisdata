%N A219052 Number of ways to write n = p + q(3 - (-1)^n)/2 with q <= n/2 and p, q, p^2 + q^2 - 1 all prime.
%C A219052 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 784.
%C A219052 This conjecture implies Goldbach's conjecture, Lemoine's conjecture, and that there are infinitely many primes of the form p^2 + q^2 - 1 with p and q both prime.
%C A219052 It has been verified for n up to 10^8.
%C A219052 Zhi-Wei Sun also made the following general conjecture: Let d be any odd integer not congruent to 1 modulo 3. Then, all large even numbers can be written as p + q with p, q, p^2 + q^2 + d all prime. If d is also not divisible by 5, then all large odd numbers can be represented as p + 2q with p, q, p^2 + q^2 + d all prime.

%e A219052 a(12) = 1 since {5, 7} is the only prime pair {p, q} for which  p + q = 12, and p^2 + q^2 - 1 is prime.
