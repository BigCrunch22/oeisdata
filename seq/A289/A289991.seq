%N A289991 Number of unlabeled connected simple graphs with n nodes of degree 4 or less and with at least a cyclic structure and a node of degree one.
%C A289991 Number of alkyl-n-cycloalkanes with n carbon atoms (the pure n-cycloalkanes aren't counted here).
%C A289991 Stereoisomerism is not taken into account. Some of the drawn structures may or may not exist due to their strained geometries.
