%N A289631 Prime powers P for which the number of modulo P residues among sums of two sixth powers is less than P.
%C A289631 Numbers P in A246655 (prime powers) for which A289630(P) < P.
%C A289631 Every number > 3 that is a power of 2, 3, or 7 is in the sequence.
%C A289631 Primes in this sequence begin 7, 13, 19, 31, 37, 43, 61, 67, 73, 79, 109, 139, 223.
%C A289631 Conjecture: 223 is the final prime in this sequence.
%C A289631 From _Jon E. Schoenfield_, Jul 14 2017: (Start)
%C A289631 If any prime power P = p^k (where p is prime and k >= 1) is in the sequence, then so is p^j for all j > k.
%C A289631 Conjecture: the terms in this sequence that are the squares of primes are the squares of 13, 37, 61, 73, 109, and every prime not congruent to 1 mod 4.

%e A289631 7 is in the sequence because A289630(7) = 3 < 7.
%e A289631 5 is not in the sequence because A289630(5) = 5.
%e A289631 A289630(12) = 9 < 12, but 12 is not in the sequence because it is not a prime power.
