%N A289001 Fixed point of the mapping 00->0010, 01->001, 10->010, starting with 00.
%C A289001 This coincides with the Pell word A171588, the fixed point of the morphism 0->001, 1->0. This was conjectured by _R. J. Mathar_, Jul 07 2017 and proved by Dekking and Keane in 2022. As observed by _Michel Dekking_, Mar 09 2022, this also proves the two conjectures about the positions of 0's and 1's stated in the MATHEMATICA section. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 09 2022
%C A289001 Conjecture:  the number of letters (0's and 1's) in the n-th iterate of the mapping is given by A289004.
