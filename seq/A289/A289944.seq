%N A289944 Sizes of triangles in the tilings of a convex polygon by n equilateral triangles described in A014529 written as triangle T(n,m), n >= 1, 1 <= m <= n.
%C A289944 Sizes are counted as multiples of the side length of a smallest triangle with assumed side length 1.
%C A289944 If more than one tiling resulting in a polygon of maximum area exists for a given number of triangles, the lexicographically smallest list of triangles is given.
%C A289944 The sequence is based on an illustration given in the German translation of Ian Stewart's article in Math. Recreations, Scientific American, Jul 15 1997, p. 96.
%C A289944 A continuation of the sequence would need the details of _John W. Layman_'s extension of A014529.
%C A289944 There is a tiling with 12 equilateral triangles and _John W. Layman_'s calculated area of 860 that has triangles of sizes 1, 3, 3, 4, 7, 7, 7, 10, 11, 12, 12, 13. - _Peter Munn_, Aug 23 2017
%C A289944 There is a tiling with 13 equilateral triangles and _John W. Layman_'s calculated area of 1559 that has 13 triangles of sizes 2, 2, 3, 5, 7, 7, 7, 12, 14, 15, 15, 16, 18. - _Peter Munn_, Aug 24 2017
%C A289944 From _Peter Munn_, Jan 01 2018: (Start)
%C A289944 There are tilings matching the other areas calculated by _John W. Layman_ as follows:
%C A289944 A hexagon of area 2831 tiled with 14 equilateral triangles of sizes 1, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 11, 11, 16, 17, 20, 20, 23, 24 with the smallest 5 arranged as in the A014529 tiling with 9 triangles, and the size 24 triangle placed at the concave vertex of the region tiled by the smallest 5.
%C A289944 A hexagon of area 5114 tiled with 15 equilateral triangles of sizes 1, 1, 6, 6, 7, 8, 8, 15, 15, 21, 23, 27, 27, 31, 32 with the smallest 6 arranged as in the A014529 tiling with 10 triangles, and the size 32 triangle placed at the concave vertex of the region tiled by the smallest 6.
