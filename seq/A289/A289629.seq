%N A289629 Smallest positive k such that (k+1)^n + (-k)^n is divisible by a square greater than 1.
%C A289629 From _Kevin P. Thompson_, Dec 03 2021: (Start)
%C A289629 Most of the factorizations to prove known terms of this sequence have been uploaded to factordb.com.
%C A289629 For known terms up to n = 100, the square that divides (k+1)^n + (-k)^n is very small, less than 1500^2, with only one example greater than 1000^2.
%C A289629 a(20m+10) = 1 for m >= 0. With k = 1 and starting at n = 20*0 + 10 = 10, (k+1)^n + (-k)^n = 2^10 + 1 = 1024 + 1 = 1025 which is divisible by 5^2. Since the last two digits of 2^n repeat in a cycle of length 20, (k+1)^n + (-k)^n will always be divisible by 5^2 for n = 20m + 10.
%C A289629 Conjecture: (k+1)^n + (-k)^n is not squarefree for the following (n, k) patterns, with m >= 1: (22m-11, 2), (20m-6, 3), (20m-2, 3), (3^m, 7), (15m, 7), (20m-15, 14), (16m-8, 19), (42m-35, 23), and (8m-4, 113). In each case, the value of a(n) in this sequence is usually equal to the value specified for k, but sometimes this value is not the smallest such k. For example, in the (n, k) = (20m-2, 3) case, a(20m-2) = 3 for m = 1..3, but at m = 4, a(20*4-2) = a(78) = 1.

%e A289629 a(2) = 3 because (1+1)^2 + (-1)^2 = 5 is squarefree, (2+1)^2 + (-2)^2 = 13 is squarefree, and (3+1)^2 + (-3)^2 = 25 is divisible by 5^2.
