%N A289690 Least k such that there are exactly n perfect powers between 10k and 10k + 10.
%C A289690 I do not know if a(5) exists. If it does, the numbers 10k+1, 10k+3, 10k+5, 10k+7, 10k+9 will be perfect powers. But those numbers are very scarce.
%C A289690 Further, a(6), ..., a(10) cannot exist because of the Mihailescu theorem, as the only adjoining perfect powers are 8 and 9.
%C A289690 a(5) is extremely unlikely to exist; if it does, it is larger than 10^70. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jul 21 2017
%e A289690 If n=2, then there are 2 power numbers between 20 and 30: 25 and 27, and this is the least k with this property.
