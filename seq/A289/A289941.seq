%N A289941 Number of tilings of n interlocking sphinx tiled shape subunits.
%C A289941 The shape for this sequence attempts to find a connection between the unique geometry of the sphinx tile and a polymerization process.
%C A289941 The number of tilings of a stackable sphinx tiled shape has previously been described A287999.
%C A289941 In contrast to the stackable shape this shape is interlocking.
%C A289941 This shape has one female and three male parts.
%C A289941 The properties of this shape that inhibit different polymerizations are noted.
%C A289941 The various polymer configurations from a central nucleus are shown.
