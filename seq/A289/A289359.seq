%N A289359 Image of 0 under repeated application of the morphism phi = {x -> x,x+1,x+2 if x mod 3 = 0; x -> x-1 if x mod 3 = 1; or x -> x+2 if x mod 3 = 2, for x = 0,1,2,3,...}.
%C A289359 Similar to A288577, except the "x-1" term causes this sequence to return to 0 infinitely often, whereas A288577 is only 0 at the 0th term.
%C A289359 This is the limit of a series of iterations. The length of each iteration is given by A000213, beginning with the second term of that sequence (1, 3, 5, 8, 17, etc.):
%C A289359 0
%C A289359 0, 1, 2
%C A289359 0, 1, 2, 0, 4
%C A289359 0, 1, 2, 0, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3
%C A289359 0, 1, 2, 0, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 4, 5
%C A289359 When written in blocks in this way, each subsequent block is the concatenation of the previous block, the second-previous block, and the third-previous block, with each term incremented by 3.
