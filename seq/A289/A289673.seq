%N A289673 Take n-th string over {1,2} in lexicographic order and apply the Post tag system described in A284116 (but adapted to the alphabet {1,2}) just once.
%C A289673 Post's tag system maps a word w over {1,2} to w', where if w begins with 1, w' is obtained by appending 11 to w and deleting the first three letters, or if w begins with 2, w' is obtained by appending 2212 to w and deleting the first three letters.
%C A289673 The empty word is denoted by -1.
%C A289673 We work over {1,2} rather than the official alphabet {0,1} because of the prohibition in the OEIS of terms (other than 0 itself) which begin with 0.

%e A289673 The initial words are:
%e A289673 1,2,11,12,21,22,111,112,121,122,211,212,221,222,1111,...
%e A289673 Applying the tag system over {1,2} these become:
%e A289673 -1, 12, 1, 1, 212, 212, 11, 11, 11, 11, 2212, 2212, 2212, 2212, 111, ...
%e A289673 If we were working over {0,1} the initial strings would be:
%e A289673 0,1,00,01,10,11,000,001,010,011,100,101,110,111,0000,...
%e A289673 and applying the tag system over {0,1} described in A284116 these would become:
%e A289673 -1, 01, 0, 0, 101, 101, 00, 00, 00, 00, 1101, 1101, 1101, 1101, 000, ...
