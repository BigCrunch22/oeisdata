%N A289990 Number of unlabeled connected simple graphs with n nodes of degree 4 or less and degree at least 2 which are not 4-regular graphs.
%C A289990 This is the number of pure n-cycloalkylic structures with n carbon atoms.
%C A289990 Stereoisomerism is not taken into account. Some of the drawn structures may or may not exist due to their strained geometries.
%F A289990 a(n) = A289989(n) - A006820(n).
%e A289990 a(4) = 3, because here are 3 molecules with 4 carbons following the above rule: cyclobutane, bicyclobutane, tetrahedrane.
%e A289990 a(5) = 10, because there are 10 molecules with 5 carbons following above rule: cyclopentane, housane, spiropentane, pyramidane, bicyclopentane, propellane, tricyclo[2.1.0.0^(1,3)]pentane, tricyclo[2.1.0.0^(2,5)]pentane, tetracyclopentane, pentacyclopentane.
%Y A289990 Cf. A006820, A121941, A289989, A289991.
