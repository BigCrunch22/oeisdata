%N A289263 Number of maximal roller coasters in all n! permutations of n elements.
%C A289263 A roller coaster is a pattern in a permutation (not necessarily consecutive) consisting of alternating up and down steps, with always at least two in one direction.
%C A289263 A maximal roller coaster is one that cannot be extended further.
%C A289263 Note that the singleton pattern (only one element) is not considered a roller coaster.
%C A289263 Examples:
%C A289263 - 123 and 321 are the only two (maximal) roller coasters in all permutations with 3 elements; see also the examples section. These patterns are the smallest two roller coasters that exist.
%C A289263 - The permutation 1536742 contains the maximal roller coasters 136742, 156742 and 532, no further maximal roller coaster.
%C A289263 - The permutation 163978524 contains among others the maximal roller coasters 124 and 137854. In total, this permutation has 14 maximal roller coasters.
%C A289263 - The permutation 1254367 is already a roller coaster, so the only maximal roller coaster is the permutation itself.

%e A289263 For n = 3 the a(3) = 2 maximal roller coasters are 123 (of the permutation 123) and 321 (of the permutation 321); the permutations 132, 213, 231 and 312 do not contain any roller coaster pattern.
