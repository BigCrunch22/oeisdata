%N A289841 Number of elements added at n-th stage to the structure of the complex square cross described in A289840.
%C A289841 For n = 0..17 the sequence is similar to the known toothpick sequences.
%C A289841 The surprising fact is that for n >= 18 the sequence has a periodic tail. More precisely, it has period 8: repeat [32, 80, 16, 16, 16, 64, 48, 48]. This tail is in accordance with the expansion of the four arms of the cross. The tail also can be written starting from the 20th stage, with period 8: repeat [16, 16, 16, 64, 48, 48, 32, 80], (see example).
%C A289841 This sequence is essentially the first differences of A289840. The behavior is similar to A290221 and A294021 in the sense that these three sequences from cellular automata have the property that after the initial terms the continuation is a periodic sequence. - _Omar E.
