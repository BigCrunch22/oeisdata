%N A289137 Number of extended polydrafters with n cells, identifying mirror images.
%C A289137 An extended polydrafter is a plane figure formed by joining congruent 30-60-90 triangles along edges and half hypotenuses, without the requirement for proper polydrafters that the cells lie on the polyiamond (triangle) grid.

%e A289137 a(2)=13 because there are 6 proper didrafters and 7 more didrafters that do not conform to the polyiamond grid.
%e A289137 See the Logelium link for diagrams.
%Y A289137 Cf. A056842 (number of [proper] polydrafters with n cells); A217720 (number of one-sided polydrafters with n cells).
