%N A289469 Numbers k such that it is possible to form a palindrome by concatenating the first k positive integers in some order.
%C A289469 For k=19 and k=20 there are 8! such palindromes.
%C A289469 There are no such palindromes for k = 101, 119, 121, 139, 141, 159, 161, 179, 181, 199. This is because it is impossible to have a pair matching "100".
%C A289469 It is unknown whether there exist palindromes that are a concatenation of the first k primes. The list of k for which such palindromes could exist is in S001070 (see Noe's link). It has been proven that k=36 and k=247 cannot exist.
%C A289469 For k=21, 11612160 admissible permutations produce 8069040 distinct palindromes. These counts are respectively equal to 20240640 and 13633200 for k=22. - _Giovanni Resta_, Sep 02 2017
