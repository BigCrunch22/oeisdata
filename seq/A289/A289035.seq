%N A289035 Fixed point of the mapping 00->0010, 01->010, 10->010, starting with 00.
%C A289035 Conjecture: the number of letters (0's and 1's) in the n-th iterate of the mapping is given by A289004.
%C A289035 The mapping is applied as in the Mathematica command StringReplace. In particular, for a word of odd length, the final letter is retained, as in 0010010 -> 00100100100. (If the final letter is removed, the iterates are changed, but the limiting fixed point remains unchanged. See A293077.)
%C A289035 More generally, to describe the result of the command StringReplace[w, {u(1)->v(1), u(2)->v(2) ... u(n)-<v(n)}], assume that no u(i) is a subword of any other u(j). The word w is then a concatenation of subwords u(i(0)), g(1), u(i(1)), g(2), u(i(2)), ..., such that u(i(0)) is the empty word, and each g(j) is the subword, g, possibly empty, of least length immediately following u(i(j-1)), such that no subword of g is one of the words u(i). The result of the command is then the concatenation of g(1), v(i(1)), g(2), v(i(2)), ...  That is, each u(i) is replaced by v(i), and the words g(i) are left unchanged.
%C A289035 Conjecture: a(n) = A171588(n-3) for n>3. - _Michel Dekking_, Mar 20 2022
