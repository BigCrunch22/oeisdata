%N A289674 Consider the Post tag system described in A284116 (but adapted to the alphabet {1,2}); sequence lists the words that belong to cycles.
%C A289674 Post's tag system maps a word w over {1,2} to w', where if w begins with 1, w' is obtained by appending 11 to w and deleting the first three letters, or if w begins with 2, w' is obtained by appending 2212 to w and deleting the first three letters.
%C A289674 Under this Post tag system, some words when iterated end at the empty word, others go into cycles, and others may have an orbit which grows without limit. See A289670 and A289671 for the counts of the first two types. This sequence gives a list of the words that belong to cycles.
%C A289674 It is an important open question to decide if there is any word whose orbit grows without limit.
%C A289674 We work over {1,2} rather than the official alphabet {0,1} because of the prohibition in the OEIS of terms (other than 0 itself) which begin with 0.

%e A289674 The first two cycles that one encounters when applying the Post tag system to words over the alphabet {1,2} are (21211, 112212) and (2122212111111, 22121111112212, 211111122122212, 1111221222122212, 122122212221211, 12221222121111).
