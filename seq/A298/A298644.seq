%N A298644 The indices of the Carlitz compositions (i.e., compositions without adjacent equal parts).
%C A298644 We define the index of a composition to be the positive integer whose binary form has run-lengths (i.e., runs of 1's, runs of 0's, etc., from left to right) equal to the parts of the composition. Example: the composition [1,1,3,1] has index 46 since the binary form of 46 is 101110.
%C A298644 The command c(n) from the Maple program yields the composition having index n.

%e A298644 135 is in the sequence since its binary form is 10000111 and the composition [1,4,3] has no adjacent equal parts.
%e A298644 139 is not in the sequence since its binary form is 10001011 and the composition [1,3,1,1,2] has two adjacent equal parts.
