%N A298973 Squarefree primitive abundant numbers (first definition: having only deficient proper divisors).
%C A298973 Squarefree numbers (A005117) in A071395. The number of terms with n prime factors are counted in A295369. The subsequence of odd terms is A249263.
%C A298973 Two variants of the present sequence are possible: the terms listed by size, or as a table whose n-th row gives all those with n prime factors (so that A295369 would be the row lengths). They would differ only from a(322) = 692835 on, which is the first term with 6 prime factors, while a(755) = 4199030 is the last term with 5 prime factors.
%C A298973 A subsequence of the variant A249242, squarefree primitive abundant numbers using the 2nd definition, A091191, i.e., having no abundant proper divisors.
%C A298973 These numbers are also primitive unitary abundant numbers: unitary abundant numbers (A034683) that are also primitive abundant numbers (A071395). A unitary abundant number k is primitive if and only if usigma(k) - 2*k < 2*k/p^e, where p^e is the largest prime power dividing k and usigma is the sum of unitary divisors function (A034448). For numbers k in this sequence limsup_{k->oo} usigma(k)/k = 2. (Prasad and Reddy, 1990). - _Amiram Eldar_, Jul 18 2020

%e A298973 The only squarefree primitive abundant number (SFPAN) with only 3 prime factors is a(1) = 2*5*7 = 70. Indeed, this number is abundant (sigma(70) - 70 = 1 + 2 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 14 + 35 = 74) but all of 2*5, 2*7 and 5*7 are deficient. This is also the smallest (thus primitive) weird number, see A002975.
%e A298973 The A295369(4) = 18 SFPAN with 4 prime factors range from a(2) = 2*5*11*13 = 1430 to a(19) = 2*5*11*53 = 5830.
%e A298973 The A295369(5) = 610 SFPAN with 5 prime factors range from a(20) = 3*5*7*11*13 = 15015 to a(755) = 2*5*11*59*647 = 4199030, but the first term with 6 prime factors occurs already at a(322) =  3*5*11*13*17*19 = 692835.
