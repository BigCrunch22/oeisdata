%N A298676 Number of partitions of n that can be uniquely recovered from their P-graphs.
%C A298676 a(n) is the number of partitions of n that can be uniquely recovered from its P-graph, the simple graph whose vertices are the parts of the partition, two of which are joined by an edge if, and only if, they have a common factor greater than 1.

%e A298676 a(1) = 1 because the sole partition of 1 can be recovered from its P-graph, a single vertex.
%e A298676 a(2) = 2 because both partitions of 2 can be recovered from their corresponding P-graphs.
