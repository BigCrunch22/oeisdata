%N A298980 Numbers n such that there exists an integer k < n for which the significant decimal digits of k/n (i.e., neglecting leading zeros) are those of n.
%C A298980 Otherwise said, floor(10^m*k/n) = n for some k and m.
%C A298980 Also, numbers n which have n as a subsequence in the decimal expansion of k/n, 0 < k < n.
%C A298980 Initially it appears that if n is present so is 10n and 11n. These two statements are false. 14 is present but 140 is not. 1/140 = 0.00714285... 17 is present but 187 is not.
%C A298980 However if there is a k between 0 and n so that gcd(k,n) = r > 1 and k/r is used to show that n/r is a term, then so is n. As an example, 33 is a term since 11/33 = 1/3 and 3 is a term. See the first example.
%C A298980 The density of numbers in this sequence appears to increase to above 55% near n ~ 10^9. See A298981 for the complement and A298982 for the k-values.
%e A298980 3 is a term since 1/3 = 0.3333... and its fractional part begins with 3;
%e A298980 6 is a term since 10/6 = 1.666... and its fractional part begins with 6;
%e A298980 7 is a term since 5/7 = 0.714285... and its fractional part begins with 7;
%e A298980 8 is a term since 7/8 = 0.87500... and its fractional part begins with 8;
%e A298980 10 is a term since 1/10 = 0.1000... and its fractional part begins with 10;
%e A298980 14 is a term since 2/14 = 0.142857... and its fractional part begins with 14;
%e A298980 17 is a term since 3/17 = 0.17647058823... and its fractional part begins with 17; etc.
