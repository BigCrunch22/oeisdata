%N A298074 The number of k-cycles in the symmetric group on k symbols whose commutator with the standard k-cycle (1,2,...,k) is a k-cycle, where k = 2n-1.
%C A298074 With the exception of the second term, it is not hard to prove that the sequence increases monotonically. Empirically, the growth is super-exponential.
%C A298074 For even k, there are no such k-cycles in S_k whose commutator with the standard k-cycle is a k-cycle.
%K A298074 nonn,more
