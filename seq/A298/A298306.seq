%N A298306 The Frobenius number of the set of binary n-th powers, divided out by its GCD.
%C A298306 The binary n-th powers are those positive integers whose base-2 representation consists of n consecutive identical blocks. For example, the binary squares 3, 10, 15, ... form sequence A020330. The GCD of the binary n-th powers form sequence A014491. The Frobenius number of a set S with GCD 1 is the largest number not representable as an N-linear combination of members of S.

%e A298306 For n = 2 the first few binary squares are 3, 10, 15, 36, ... with GCD 1 and the Frobenius number of (3, 10, 15, 36) is 17.
