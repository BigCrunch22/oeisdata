%N A298746 Numbers n whose base-2 representation can be written as the concatenation of the base-2 representations of a list of prime numbers, allowing leading zeros.
%C A298746 Has positive density in the positive integers, which can be proved by considering only those numbers obtained using the primes 2 and 3.
%e A298746 For example, 26 is such a number because 26 in base 2 is 11010, which can be written as the concatenation (11)(010).
%Y A298746 Cf. A090421, which does not allow leading zeros.
