%N A298157 Number of primitive abundant numbers (A071395) with n prime factors, counted with multiplicity.
%C A298157 This uses the first definition of primitive abundant numbers, A071395: having only deficient proper divisors. The second definition (A091191: having no abundant proper divisors) would yield infinite a(3), since all numbers 6*p, p > 3, are in that sequence.
%C A298157 See A287728 for the number of ODD primitive abundant numbers with n prime factors, counted with multiplicity and A295369 for the number of squarefree primitive abundant numbers with n distinct prime factors.
%C A298157 It appears that a(n) is just slightly larger than A295369(n).

%e A298157 For n=3, the only two primitive abundant numbers (PAN) are 2*2*5 = 20 and 2*5*7 = 70. The latter is also a primitive weird number, see A002975.
%e A298157 For n=4, the 25 PAN range from 2^3*11 = 88 to 2*5*11*53 = 5830.
