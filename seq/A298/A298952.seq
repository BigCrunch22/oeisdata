%N A298952 First put a(n)=0 for all n, then start with a(0) = 1 and add at step n >= 0 the term 1 at position 2*n + a(n).
%C A298952 Sum_{i = 0..n} a(i)/n tends to 1/2 as n tends to infinity. [corrected by _RÃ©my Sigrist_, Jan 31 2018]
%C A298952 From _Michel Dekking_, Sep 07 2020: (Start)
%C A298952 The above limit statement follows from a much stronger property.
%C A298952 Let mu be the 'exchanged' Thue-Morse morphism given by
%C A298952       mu(0) = 10,  mu(1) = 01.
%C A298952 CLAIM: a(234...) = mu(a(123...)).
%C A298952 Here a(234...) denotes the word associated to the sequence a(2), a(3), a(4),....
%C A298952 Proof: If a(n)=1 then a(2n+1)=1, and it also follows that a(2n)=0.  If a(n)=0 then a(2n)=1, and it also follows that a(2n+1)=0.
%C A298952 This can also be expressed as mu(a(n))=a(2n)a(2n+1).
%C A298952 (End)
