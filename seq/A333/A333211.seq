%N A333211 Variation of Van Eck's sequence A181391: a(n+1) = the minimum positive offset m from a(n) such that a(n-m-1)*a(n-m) = a(n-1)*a(n); a(n+1)=0 if no such m exists. Start with a(1) = a(2) = 0.
%C A333211 After 100 million terms the smallest number not appearing is 179549, while the smallest product of adjacent terms not appearing is 2969.

%e A333211 a(3) = 0 as a(1)*a(2) = 0*0 = 0, which has not previously appeared as the product of two adjacent terms.
%e A333211 a(4) = 1 as a(2)*a(3) = 0*0 = 0, which equals the product a(1)*a(2), one term back from a(3).
%e A333211 a(5) = 1 as a(3)*a(4) = 0*1 = 0, which equals the product a(2)*a(3), one term back from a(3).
%e A333211 a(6) = 0 as a(4)*a(5) = 1*1 = 1, which has not previously appeared as the product of two adjacent terms.
%e A333211 a(19) = 13 as a(17)*a(18) = 1*1 = 1, which equals the product a(4)*a(5), thirteen terms back from a(18).
