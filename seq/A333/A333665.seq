%N A333665 Numbers that occur in A057144 arranged in ascending order.
%C A333665 30240 is the smallest term that is not highly composite (A002182).
%C A333665 From _Hal M. Switkay_, Jul 25 2022: (Start)
%C A333665 It appears that each term is the least number having its prime signature (A025487).
%C A333665 Although it would be desirable to produce more terms of this sequence, the first 28 terms represent the union of at least the first 20000 terms of A057144.
%C A333665 The smallest of the most frequently occurring numbers in the 1-to-k multiplication table, A057144(k), do not constitute a nondecreasing function of k. Thus the minimal values of k corresponding to terms of this sequence do not form an increasing sequence. For example, A057144(k) = 60 when 20 <= k <= 23 or 30 <= k <= 39; but A057144(k) = 24 when 24 <= k <= 29, and A057144(k) = 36 when 18 <= k <= 19. (End)

%e A333665 For 6 <= k <= 11, the smallest of the most frequently occurring numbers in the 1-to-k multiplication table is 6. a(4) = 6, because it is the fourth natural number to be the smallest of the most frequently occurring numbers in the 1-to-k multiplication table. - _Hal M.
