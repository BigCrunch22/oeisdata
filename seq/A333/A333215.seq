%N A333215 Lengths of maximal weakly increasing subsequences in the sequence of prime gaps (A001223).
%C A333215 Prime gaps are differences between adjacent prime numbers.
%F A333215 Ones correspond to strong prime quartets (A054804), so the sum of terms up to but not including the n-th one is A000720(A054804(n - 1)).
%e A333215 The prime gaps split into the following weakly increasing subsequences: (1,2,2,4), (2,4), (2,4,6), (2,6), (4), (2,4,6,6), (2,6), (4), (2,6), (4,6,8), (4), (2,4), (2,4,14), ...
