%N A333478 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms such that a(n) is the number of commas that a(n) has to step over (to the right) in order to find an integer embedding the substring a(n).
%C A333478 The integer embedding the substring k might not be the closest one to a(n). Example is given by a(14) = 8 = k. We see that a(8), stepping (to the right) over 8 commas, meets a(22) = 28, which is correct. But a(21) = 18 embeds also the substring 8. We don't mind that.

%e A333478 a(1) = 1 steps over 1 comma and finds a(2) = 10 which embeds the substring 1;

%e A333478 a(3) = 2 steps over 2 commas and finds a(5) = 12 which embeds the substring 2;
%e A333478 a(4) = 3 steps over 3 commas and finds a(7) = 13 which embeds the substring 3; etc.
