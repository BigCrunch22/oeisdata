%N A333913 Numbers k such that lambda(k) is not the sum of 3 squares, where lambda is the Carmichael lambda function (A002322).
%C A333913 Pollack (2011) proved that this sequence has a lower and an upper asymptotic densities, and conjectured that they do not coincide.

%e A333913 1 is not a term since lambda(1) = 1 = 0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 is the sum of 3 squares.
%e A333913 29 is a term since lambda(29) = 28 is not the sum of 3 squares.
