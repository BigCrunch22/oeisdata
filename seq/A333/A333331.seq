%N A333331 Number of integer points in the convex hull in R^n of parking functions of length n.
%C A333331 It is observed by _Gus Wiseman_ in A368596 and A368730 that this sequence appears to be the complement of those sequences. If this is the case, then a(n) is the number of labeled graphs with loops allowed in which each connected component has an equal number of vertices and edges and the conjectured formula holds. Terms for n >= 9 are expected to be 167341283, 4191140394, 116425416531, ... - _Andrew Howroyd_, Jan 10 2024

%F A333331 Conjectured e.g.f.: exp(-log(1-T(x))/2 + T(x)/2 - T(x)^2/4) where T(x) = -LambertW(-x) is the e.g.f. of A000169. - _Andrew Howroyd_, Jan 10 2024
%e A333331 For n=2 the parking functions are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). They are the only integer points in their convex hull. For n=3, in addition to the 16 parking functions, there is the additional point (2,2,2).
