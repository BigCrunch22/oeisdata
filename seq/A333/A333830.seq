%N A333830 a(n) is the digit sum of the concatenation of the decimal digits of n,n+1,...,n+k, where k >= 0 and minimal, such that the concatenation is divisible by its digit sum, or -1 if no such sum is known.
%C A333830 A heuristic argument, see the companion sequence A333687, suggests that the digit sum should always exist. Also see A333687 for the corresponding values of k for each digit sum and for details of the currently unknown terms.
%C A333830 The first escape value is a(76) = -1. - _Georg Fischer_, Jul 16 2020

%e A333830 a(1) = 1 as the digit sum 1 divides 1 itself. Similarly a(2),...,a(9) equal 2,...,9 respectively.
%e A333830 a(10) = 1 as the digit sum of 10 is 1 which divides 10.
%e A333830 a(11) = 9 as A333687(11) = 2 giving the decimal concatenation 111213 which has a digit sum of 9.
%e A333830 a(16) = 36 as A333687(16) = 4 giving the decimal concatenation 1617181920 which has a digit sum of 36.
