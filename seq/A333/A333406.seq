%N A333406 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive distinct integers such that if a(n) climbs over a(n) commas to the right, it is met by a term whose leftmost digit is nonprime.
%C A333406 This is conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A333406 a(1) = 1 climbs over 1 comma and is met by the nonprime digit 4;
%e A333406 a(2) = 4 climbs over 4 commas and is met by the nonprime digit 8;

%e A333406 a(4) = 3 climbs over 3 commas and is met by the nonprime digit 9;
%e A333406 a(5) = 6 climbs over 6 commas and is met by the nonprime digit 1 (of "11"); etc.
%Y A333406 Cf. A333404 (same idea, but the leftmost digit of the target is prime).
