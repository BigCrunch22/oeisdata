%N A333216 Lengths of maximal subsequences without adjacent equal terms in the sequence of prime gaps.
%C A333216 Prime gaps are differences between adjacent prime numbers.
%C A333216 Essentially the same as A145024. - _R. J. Mathar_, Mar 16 2020
%F A333216 Ones correspond to balanced prime quartets (A054800), so the sum of terms up to but not including the n-th one is A000720(A054800(n - 1)) = A090832(n).
%e A333216 The prime gaps split into the following subsequences without adjacent equal terms: (1,2), (2,4,2,4,2,4,6,2,6,4,2,4,6), (6,2,6,4,2,6,4,6,8,4,2,4,2,4,14,4,6,2,10,2,6), (6,4,6), (6,2,10,2,4,2,12), (12,4,2,4,6,2,10,6), ...
%t A333216 Length/@Split[Differences[Array[Prime,100]],UnsameQ]//Most
%Y A333216 First differences of A064113.
%Y A333216 The version for the Kolakoski sequence is A306323.
%Y A333216 The weakly decreasing version is A333212.
