%N A333359 Variation of Van Eck's sequence A181391: a(n+1) = the minimum positive offset m from a(n) such that the decimal concatenation of a(n-m), a(n-m+1), ..., a(n-m+k) = a(n), where k >= 0; a(n+1)=0 if no such m exists. Start with a(1)=0.
%C A333359 The terms up to a(56) are the same as A181391 but vary from a(57) and beyond. After 10000 terms the smallest number not appearing is 332.

%e A333359 a(42) = 0 as a(41) = 17, and neither '17' or adjacent sequence terms '1' and '7' appear earlier in the sequence.
%e A333359 a(57) = 51 as a(56) = 20, and the value '20' is the concatenation of a(5) = 2 and a(6) = 0, and a(5) is fifty-one terms back from a(56).
