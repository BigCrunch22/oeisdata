%N A333257 Number of distinct consecutive subsequence-sums of the k-th composition in standard order.
%C A333257 A composition of n is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to n. The k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again.
%F A333257 a(n) = A333224(n) + 1.
%e A333257 The ninth composition in standard order is (3,1), which has consecutive subsequences (), (1), (3), (3,1), with sums 0, 1, 3, 4, so a(9) = 4.
%t A333257 stc[n_]:=Differences[Prepend[Join@@Position[Reverse[IntegerDigits[n,2]],1],0]]//Reverse;

%Y A333257 Dominated by A124771.
%Y A333257 Compositions where every subinterval has a different sum are counted by A169942 and A325677 and ranked by A333222, while the case of partitions is counted by A325768 and ranked by A325779.
%Y A333257 Positive subset-sums of partitions are counted by A276024 and A299701.
%Y A333257 Knapsack partitions are counted by A108917 and ranked by A299702.
%Y A333257 Knapsack compositions are counted by A325676 and A325687 and ranked by A333223.
%Y A333257 The version for Heinz numbers of partitions is A325770.
%Y A333257 Not allowing empty subsequences gives A333224.
