%N A333356 Terms describing the nonprime digits' positions in the way explained in the Comments section.
%C A333356 "11" must be read: "At position 1, there is a 1". And indeed, there is, when considering the sequence as a string of concatenated digits;
%C A333356 "21" reads: "At position 2, there is a 1" - which is true;
%C A333356 "41" reads: "At position 4, there is a 1" - which is also true;
%C A333356 "54" reads: "At position 5, there is a 4" - which is also true;
%C A333356 ...
%C A333356 "101" reads: "At position 10, there is a 1" - which is true (the 1 in 61); etc.
%C A333356 We don't read the 2 of 21 as this 2 is a prime digit. Thus 32 and 75 are not in the sequence.
