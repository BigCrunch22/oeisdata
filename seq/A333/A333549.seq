%N A333549 Consider the list (A333552) of numbers m defined by property that when the Recamán term A005132(m) is being computed, we are unable to subtract m from A005132(m-1) because, although A003132(m-1) >= m, the result of the subtraction, A005132(m-1)-m, is already in A005132; sequence gives the successive values of A005132(m-1)-m.
%C A333549 These are the collisions that are avoided when A005132 is being constructed.

%e A333549 After we have found A005132(6)=13, we attempt to subtract 7 from 13 to get a(7). However, this would give 6, which is a collision, since we already have A005132(3)=6. So 6 gets added to the current sequence.
