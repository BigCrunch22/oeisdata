%N A333661 a(n) is the number of convex polyhedra with n edges whose faces are regular polygons.
%C A333661 Convex polyhedra with whose faces are regular polygons are either Platonic solids, Archimedean solids, prisms, antiprisms, or Johnson solids.

%e A333661 For n = 18, the a(18) = 4 polyhedra are: the truncated tetrahedron, the hexagonal prism, and the Johnson solids J_64 and J_84.
%e A333661 For n > 180, the only polyhedra are the prisms and antiprisms. When 3 divides n, there is an (n/3)-gonal prism; when 4 divides n, and there is an (n/4)-gonal antiprism.
%e A333661 Starting at n = 181 the sequence has a 12-term cycle that goes 0,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,2. - _J. Lowell_, Oct 18 2020
