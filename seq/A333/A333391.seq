%e A333391 Case 1: When the isogonic center is inside the triangle, i.e., the three internal angles are all less than 120 degrees: Example: Length of three sides (a, b, c) = (57, 65, 73), rational distances with signs (x, y, z) = (325/7, 264/7, 195/7);
%e A333391 Case 2: When the isogonic center is outside the triangle, i.e., an internal angle is greater than 120 degrees. Example: Lengths of three sides (a, b, c) = (43, 248, 285), rational distances with signs (x, y, z) = (1800/7, 345/7, -136/7);
%e A333391 Thus 73 and 285 are in this sequence.
