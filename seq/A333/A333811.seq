%N A333811 a(0) = 0; for n > 0, a(n) is the smallest positive integer not yet appearing in the sequence such that a(n-1)^a(n) contains as a substring either a(n-1) or a(n).
%C A333811 a(3) = 5 as a(2) ^ a(3) = 2 ^ 5 = 32 which contains '2' as a substring.
%C A333811 a(4) = 3 as a(3) ^ a(4) = 5 ^ 3 = 125 which contains '5' as a substring.
%C A333811 a(5) = 7 as a(4) ^ a(5) = 3 ^ 7 = 2187 which contains '7' as a substring.
