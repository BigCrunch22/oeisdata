%N A333912 Numbers k such that phi(k) is not the sum of 3 squares, where phi is the Euler totient function (A000010).
%C A333912 Pollack (2011) proved that the complementary sequence has asymptotic density 7/8. Therefore the asymptotic density of this sequence is 1/8.

%e A333912 1 is not a term since phi(1) = 1 = 0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 is the sum of 3 squares.
%e A333912 29 is a term since phi(29) = 28 is not the sum of 3 squares.
