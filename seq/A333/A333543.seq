%N A333543 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) (n >= 1, k >= n+1) is the number of cells with k vertices in the dissection of an n-dimensional cube by all the hyperplanes that pass through any n vertices.
%C A333543 Rows 1 through 4 computed by _Veit Elser_, later confirmed by _Tom Karzes_.
%C A333543 The row sums give A333539.

%H A333543 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A333543/a333543.png">Illustration for a(3) = 72</a>. This shows the 4-faced cells in the 3D cube dissection. The 72 pieces have been moved away from the origin a distance proportional to the average distance of their vertices from the origin.
%H A333543 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A333543/a333543_1.png">Illustration for a(4) = 24</a>. This shows the 5-faced cells in the 3D cube dissection. The 24 pieces have been moved away from the origin a distance proportional to the average distance of their vertices from the origin. These polyhedra form a perfect octahedron inside the original cube with its points touching the cube's inner surface.
%e A333543 The two diagonals of a square cut it into four triangular pieces, so T(2,3) = 4.
