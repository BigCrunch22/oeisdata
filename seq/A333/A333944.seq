%N A333944 Constructibility sequence, the number of points constructed by straightedge and compass after successive stages of forming all possible lines, circles, and intersection points, beginning with 2 points.
%C A333944 The fourth value was computed by Teofil Camarasu, taking 6 days of computer time performing exact algebraic computations (see link to Mathematics Stack Exchange).
%C A333944 Note that circles are formed only by specifying an already existing segment as radius (so we have collapsible compasses only).

%e A333944 Begin with 2 points A and B. Construct the line containing them and the two circles having AB as radius; these intersect at four additional points, making 6 points in all. Using these 6 points, one may construct 9 new lines and 14 new circles, leading to 203 intersection points in all.
