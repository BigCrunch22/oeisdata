%N A333683 The number of steps for a knight to be trapped when moving on a spirally numbered hexagonal board to the lowest available unvisited cell and starting at cell n.
%C A333683 For a knight moving on a spirally numbered hexagonal board to the lowest available unvisited cell, see A327131, a(n) gives the number of steps before the knight is trapped when the knight starts on the cell numbered n.
%C A333683 See A327131 for the allowed knight moves, a diagram of the hexagonal board, and an illustration of the knight's path for n = 1.
%C A333683 For the first 100000 terms the longest path before the knight is trapped is for starting starting cell 81479 where it is trapped after 8125572 steps, the final cell being 8085793. In the same range the shortest path before being trapped is for starting cell 1036 where it is trapped after 1603 steps, the final cell being 1267. See the image in the links. This is likely the shortest path to being trapped for all starting cells.
