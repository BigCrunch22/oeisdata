%N A333660 a(n) is the number of n-vertex convex polyhedra whose faces are regular polygons.
%C A333660 Convex polyhedra with whose faces are regular polygons are either Platonic solids, Archimedean solids, prisms, antiprisms, or Johnson solids.
%C A333660 For n > 120, there are two such convex polyhedra for even n, the (n/2)-gonal prism and (n/2)-gonal antiprism, and no polyhedra for odd n.

%e A333660 For n = 12, the a(12) = 10 convex polyhedra with regular polygonal faces and 12 vertices are: the icosahedron, the truncated tetrahedron, the cuboctahedron, the hexagonal prism, the hexagonal antiprism, and the Johnson solids J_4, J_16, J_27, J_53, and J_88.
