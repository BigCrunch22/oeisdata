%N A333819 a(n) is the least integer q > 0 such that for some integer r, phi(q) + phi(r) = 2*n; where phi(n) is Euler's totient function (A000010).
%C A333819 Paul ErdÃ¶s and Leo Moser conjectured that, for any even numbers 2*n, there exist integers q and r such that phi(q) + phi(r) = 2*n.
%C A333819 The only time phi is odd, it equals 1. Therefore, the only time that phi(q) + phi(r) = 2*n-1 (for n>0) has no solution is when 2*n-2 is a member of A005277 = 2*A079695.
%C A333819 The first occurrence of 2*k-1, or 0 if not possible, is k=1,2,3,...: 1, 2, 8, 39, 0, 124, 204, 208, 2024, 3473, 0, 2983, 2023, ..., .
