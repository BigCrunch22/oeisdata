%N A333654 Irregular table read by rows: row n gives the number of 3-gon to k-gon contacts, with k>=3, for a regular n-gon with all diagonals drawn.
%C A333654 See A335614 for the number of 4-gon to k-gon contacts, with k>=4.
%C A333654 See A335646 for the number of 5-gon to k-gon contacts, with k>=5.
%C A333654 See A337330 for the number of 6-gon to k-gon contacts, with k>=6.
%C A333654 See A007678 for the number of regions and images of other n-gons.
%H A333654 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A333654/a333654.png">Image for n=4 with edge-count coloring</a>. This is the first n-gon with 3-gon to 3-gon contacts.
%H A333654 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A333654/a333654_1.png">Image for n=6 with edge-count coloring</a>. This is the first n-gon with 3-gon to 4-gon contacts.
%H A333654 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A333654/a333654_2.png">Image for n=7 with edge-count coloring</a>. This is the first n-gon with 3-gon to 5-gon contacts, other than n=5 which has an internal 5-gon surrounded by 3-gons by its construction.
%H A333654 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A333654/a333654_3.png">Image for n=9 with edge-count coloring</a>. This is the first n-gon with 3-gon to 6-gon contacts.
%H A333654 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A333654/a333654_4.png">Image for n=15 with edge-count coloring</a>. This is the first n-gon with 3-gon to 7-gon contacts, other than n=7 which has an internal 7-gon surrounded by 3-gons by its construction.
%H A333654 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A333654/a333654_8.png">Image for n=15 with random distance-based coloring</a>.
%H A333654 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A333654/a333654_6.png">Image for n=13 with edge-count coloring</a>. This is the first n-gon with 3-gon to 8-gon contacts.
%H A333654 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A333654/a333654_7.png">Image for n=29 with edge-count coloring</a>. This is the first n-gon with 3-gon to 10-gon and 3-gon to 11-gon contacts.
%F A333654 For odd n, with n > 3, row(n,n) = n as the n-gon contains a smaller n-gon at its center surrounded by 3-gons.
