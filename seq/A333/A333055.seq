%N A333055 Numbers k such that k and k+1 have different (ordered) prime signatures and d(k) = d(k+1), where d(k) is the number of divisors of k (A000005).
%C A333055 Apparently most of the numbers k such that k and k+1 have the same number of divisors (A005237) also have the same prime signature, i.e., they are also terms of A052213 which is a subsequence of A005237.
%C A333055 For example, up to 10^8 there are 9593611 terms in A005237, of them only 1573778 (about 16.4%) are not in A052213. This sequence in the complement of A052213 with respect to A005237.

%e A333055 26 is a term since 26 = 2 * 13 and 27 = 3^3 have different prime signatures, and d(26) = d(27) = 4.
