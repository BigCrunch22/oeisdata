%N A333111 a(n) is the least positive integer not used earlier such that n+1 and the sum of terms up to a(n) are coprime.
%C A333111 Conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers.
%e A333111 We start with a(1) = 1. To find a(2), we need the earliest positive integer such that a(1) + a(2) is coprime to 3. So, a(2) = 3. To find a(3), we can use neither 2 nor 4, because 6 and 8 have a common factor with 4, so we use a(3) = 5.
