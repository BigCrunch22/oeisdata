%N A333212 Lengths of maximal weakly decreasing subsequences in the sequence of prime gaps (A001223).
%C A333212 Prime gaps are differences between adjacent prime numbers.
%F A333212 Ones correspond to weak prime quartets A054819, so the sum of terms up to but not including the n-th one is A000720(A054819(n - 1)).
%e A333212 The prime gaps split into the following weakly decreasing subsequences: (1), (2,2), (4,2), (4,2), (4), (6,2), (6,4,2), (4), (6,6,2), (6,4,2), (6,4), (6), ...
