%N A333440 Numbers where each digit can be paired with a digit of the same value at another position so that two pairs can be nested but cannot otherwise overlap.
%C A333440 The term 0 is included by convention (we consider here that it has no digit).
%C A333440 Each term has an even number of digits, and each digit has an even number of occurrences; hence each term belongs to A283871.
%C A333440 This sequence has connections with A014486; in both sequences digits are balanced in some way.
%C A333440 All palindromes with even number of digits belong to this sequence.
%C A333440 For any n > 0, the concatenation of the first n terms of A333399 or the concatenation of the first n+1 terms of A333399 belong to this sequence.
