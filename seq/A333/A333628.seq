%N A333628 Runs-resistance of the n-th composition in standard order. Number of steps taking run-lengths to reduce the n-th composition in standard order to a singleton.
%C A333628 A composition of n is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to n. The k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again.
%C A333628 For the operation of taking the sequence of run-lengths of a finite sequence, runs-resistance is defined as the number of applications required to reach a singleton.

%e A333628 Starting with 13789 and repeatedly applying A333627 gives: 13789 -> 859 -> 110 -> 29 -> 11 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2, corresponding to the compositions: (1,2,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,1) -> (1,2,2,1,2,1,1) -> (1,2,1,1,2) -> (1,1,2,1) -> (2,1,1) -> (1,2) -> (1,1) -> (2), so a(13789) = 7.
