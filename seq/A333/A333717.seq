%N A333717 a(n) is the minimal number of vertices in a simple graph with exactly n cycles.
%C A333717 a(n+1) is at most a(n) + 2 since we can add a triangle to a graph with a(n) vertices and increase the number of cycles by 1.
%C A333717 David Eppstein observed that an N-gon with each edge replaced by a triangle has 2^N + N cycles and 2N vertices, and gluing such graphs together greedily yields an upper bound on a(n) of O(log n).

%e A333717 For n = 2, a pair of triangles sharing a vertex has five vertices; it is easy to check that no graph on three or four vertices has exactly two cycles, so a(2) = 5.
