%N A333040 Even numbers m such that sigma(m) < sigma(m-1).
%C A333040 The even terms of A333039 represent about only 7% of the data, so they are proposed in this sequence. Some of these integers are semiprimes with for example these two families:
%C A333040 1) m = 2*p with p prime of the form k^2+k+3 is in A027753. The first few terms are: 46, 118, 226, 766, ... but not all the integers of this form are terms; the first 3 counterexamples are 6, 10, 1018 (see examples).
%C A333040 2) m = 2*p with p prime = (r*s*t+1)/2 and 2<r<s<t primes, is in A234103. The first few terms are: 106, 166, 274, 346, 358, ... but not all the integers of this form are terms; the first 3 counterexamples are 386, 898 and 958 (see examples).
%C A333040 There is also this subsequence of even m = 2^2*p where p prime, congruent to 34 mod 45, is in A142330. The first few terms are: 316, 1396, 1756, 2416, ... but not all the integers of this form are terms; the first counterexample that comes from the 8th term of A142330 is 5716.
%C A333040 Even (and odd) numbers such that sigma(m) = sigma(m-1) are in A231546.

%e A333040 166 = 2*83 and 165 = 3*5*11, as 252 = sigma(166) < sigma(165) = 288, hence 166 is a term.
%e A333040 386 = 2*193 and 385 = 5*7*11, as 582 = sigma(386) > sigma(385)= 576, hence 386 is not a term.
%e A333040 766 = 2*383 where 383 = 19^2+19+3 and 765 = 3^2*5*13, as 1152 = sigma(766) < sigma(765) = 1404, hence 766 is a term.
%e A333040 1018 = 2*509 where 509 = 22^2+22+3, and 1017 = 3^2*113, as 1530 = sigma(1018) > sigma(1017) = 1482, hence 1018 is not a term.
