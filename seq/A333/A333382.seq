%N A333382 Number of adjacent unequal parts in the n-th composition in standard-order.
%C A333382 A composition of n is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to n. The k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again.
%C A333382 For n > 0, a(n) is one fewer than the number of maximal runs of the n-th composition in standard-order.
%H A333382 Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_increasing_subsequence">Longest increasing subsequence</a>
%F A333382 For n > 0, a(n) = A124767(n) - 1.
%e A333382 The 46th composition in standard order is (2,1,1,2), with maximal runs ((2),(1,1),(2)), so a(46) = 3 - 1 = 2.
