%N A333552 List of numbers k defined by property that when the Recamán term A005132(k) is being computed, we are unable to subtract k from A005132(k-1) because, although A003132(k-1) >= k, the result of the subtraction, A005132(k-1)-k, is already in A005132.
%C A333552 Positions k of addition steps in Recamán's sequence where A005132(k-1)-k = A005132(m) for some 0 <= m < k.
%C A333552 This is A187922 together with the terms in A333548.  (The difference between A187922 and the present sequence is explained by the fact that originally A005132 began at 1 rather than 0.)

%e A333552 After we have found A005132(6)=13, we attempt to subtract 7 from 13 to get a(7). However, this would give 6, which is a collision, since we already have A005132(3)=6. So 7 gets added to the current sequence.
