%N A333400 Lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of distinct integers whose partial sums are all distinct integers.
%C A333400 This sequence is infinite. Consider first n partial sums; a distinct partial sum can always be formed by choosing a sufficiently large integer for a(n+1).
%C A333400 We organize lexicographically by magnitude, i.e., a precedes b if |a| < |b|; if |a| = |b|, then a precedes b if a < b.
%C A333400 Conjecture: This is a permutation of the integers.
