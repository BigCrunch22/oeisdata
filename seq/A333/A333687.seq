%N A333687 a(n) is the minimal value of k >= 0, such that the concatenation of the decimal digits of n,n+1,...,n+k is divisible by the digit sum of the concatenation, or -1 if no such k is known.
%C A333687 As with A332580 a heuristic argument based on the divergent sum of reciprocals which approximates the probability that the digit sum of the concatenation of n+1,n+2,...,n+k will divide the concatenation suggests that k should always exist. However in the first one thousand terms there are currently fourteen terms which are unknown and have a k value of at least 10^9. These are n = 76, 250, 273, 546, 585, 663, 695, 744, 749, 760, 790, 866, 867, 983. The largest known k value in this range is k = 600747353 for n = 693, which has a corresponding digit sum of 23123615211.
%C A333687 See the companion sequence A333830 for the corresponding digit sum for each value of n.

%e A333687 a(1) = 0 as 1 is divisible by its digit sum 1 so no concatenation of additional numbers is required. This is also true for n = 2 to 10.
%e A333687 a(11) = 2 as 11 requires the concatenation of two more numbers, 12 and 13, to form 111213, which is divisible by its digit sum 9.
%e A333687 a(12) = 0 as 12 is divisible by its digit sum 3.
%e A333687 a(16) = 4 as 16 requires the concatenation of four more numbers, 17,18,19 and 20, to form 1617181920, which is divisible by its digit sum 36.
