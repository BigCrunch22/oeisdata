%N A333041 Odd numbers m such that sigma(m) > sigma(m-1).
%C A333041 The odd terms of A333038 [sigma(m) <= sigma(m-1)] represent about 95% of the data, so the odd integers that do not satisfy this relation are proposed here.
%C A333041 Except for 3, there are no prime powers in this sequence.
%C A333041 It appears that most of the terms are divisible by 3; the two smallest exceptions are 13475 and 17255 (see A323726).
%C A333041 Odd (and even) numbers such that sigma(m) = sigma(m-1) are in A231546.
%e A333041 sigma(63) = 1+3+7+9+21+63 = 104 > sigma(62) = 1+2+31+62=96 and 63 is in the sequence.
%e A333041 sigma(77) = 1+7+11+77 = 96 < sigma(76) = 1+2+4+19+38+76 = 140 and 77 is not a term.
