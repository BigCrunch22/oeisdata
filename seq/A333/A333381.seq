%N A333381 Number of maximal anti-runs of the n-th composition in standard order.
%C A333381 Anti-runs are sequences without any adjacent equal terms.
%C A333381 A composition of n is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to n. The k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again.
%C A333381 For n > 0, also one plus the number of adjacent equal pairs in the n-th composition in standard order.

%F A333381 For n > 0, a(n) = A124762(n) + 1.
%e A333381 The 46th composition in standard order is (2,1,1,2), with maximal anti-runs ((2,1),(1,2)), so a(46) = 2.
