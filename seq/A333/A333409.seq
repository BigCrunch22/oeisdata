%N A333409 Triangle read by rows: row j lists the first j natural numbers by ascending n-bit bientropy (n >= 8).
%C A333409 The natural numbers are sorted by the relative order and disorder of their n binary digits as measured by the bientropy function. When two or more natural numbers have the same bientropy, their natural order is preserved.

%F A333409 Given a binary string s = s1...sn (where in this application n >= 8), there are n-1 binary derivatives of s, Dk(s), 1 <= k <= n-1.
%F A333409 The first binary derivative of s, D1(s), is the binary string of length n-1 formed by XORing adjacent pairs of digits of s.
%F A333409 We refer to the k-th derivative of s, Dk(s), as the binary derivative of Dk-1(s).
%F A333409 p(k) is the proportion of 1's in Dk.
%F A333409 D0 = s;
%F A333409 0*log_2(0) is defined to be 0;
%F A333409 C = 1/(2^(n-1)-1);
%F A333409 D = Sum_{k=0..n-2}(-p(k)*log_2(p(k))-(1-p(k))*log_2(1-p(k)))*2^k.
%F A333409 bientropy(s) = C*D;
%e A333409 For example, the bientropy of eleven is 0.9506 as its binary digits (00001011) are not periodic. The sequence always starts with zero as zero is a periodic binary number (00000000...) with a bientropy of 0.0000. Each row j reveals where the j-th natural number sits relative to the rest given its bientropy.
