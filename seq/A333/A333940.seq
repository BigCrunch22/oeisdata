%N A333940 Number of Lyndon factorizations of the k-th composition in standard order.
%C A333940 We define the Lyndon product of two or more finite sequences to be the lexicographically maximal sequence obtainable by shuffling the sequences together. For example, the Lyndon product of (231) with (213) is (232131), the product of (221) with (213) is (222131), and the product of (122) with (2121) is (2122121). A Lyndon factorization of a composition c is a multiset of compositions whose Lyndon product is c.
%C A333940 A composition of n is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to n. The k-th composition in standard order (graded reverse-lexicographic, A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%C A333940 Also the number of multiset partitions of the Lyndon-word factorization of the n-th composition in standard order.
%F A333940 For n > 0, Sum_{k = 2^(n-1)..2^n-1} a(k) = A034691(n).
%e A333940 We have  a(300) = 5, because the 300th composition (3,2,1,3) has the following Lyndon factorizations:
%e A333940   ((3,2,1,3))
%e A333940   ((1,3),(3,2))
%e A333940   ((2),(3,1,3))
