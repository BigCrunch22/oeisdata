%N A333206 a(n) is the least decimal digit of n^3.
%C A333206 Dean Hickerson found an infinite sequence of n such that a(n) > 0 (see Guy, sec F24). Are there infinitely many such that a(n) > 1? If not, what is the greatest n with a(n)=k for each k > 1?
%C A333206 Heuristically, we should expect on the order of ((10-m)^3/100)^d terms n with d digits and a(n) >= m.  Since 5^3/100 > 1 > 4^3/100 we should expect infinitely many terms with a(n) >= 5 but only finitely many terms with a(n) >= 6.  See A291644 for a(n) = 5.  There are only two n <= 10^6 with a(n) >= 6, namely a(2) = 8 and a(92) = 6.

%F A333206 a(n) = A054054(n^3).
%e A333206 The least digit of 6^3=216 is 1, so a(6)=1.
