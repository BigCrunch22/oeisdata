%N A333288 Triangle read by rows: consider a figure made up of a row of n congruent rectangles and the diagonals of all visible rectangles; T(n,k) (1 <= k <= n) is the number of regions in the k-th rectangle.
%C A333288 This was originally based on the data in _Jinyuan Wang_'s A324042, and then extended by _Lars Blomberg_.
%C A333288 Since the cells are either triangles or quadrilaterals, this is the sum of the two arrays A333286 and A333287.
%C A333288 It would be nice to have a formula for these entries. It is easy to see that the first column is 4n for n>=1.
