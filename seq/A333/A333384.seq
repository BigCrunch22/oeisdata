%N A333384 Use the Möbius (or Moebius) function mu(n) (A008683) to define a walk on a square lattice. A value of 1 is a move to the right, a value of -1 is a move to the left, and a value of 0 is a move either up or down depending on whether the previous nonzero value was +1 or -1. Sequence lists moves which reach a point that is further from the origin than any earlier move.
%e A333384 a(6) is 9. a(5) has a position on the Cartesian plane {-2, -2} and Möbius mu(9) is 0 and the previous nonzero was -1, resulted in a position of {-2, -3}; a distance further from the origin than a(5).
