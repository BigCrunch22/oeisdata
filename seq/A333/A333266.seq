%N A333266 a(n) is the smallest number k such that for all m >= k there is at least one prime partition of m with prime(n) as least part.
%C A333266 a(n) is a term if and only if it is the smallest number such that there exists a prime partition of every m in the interval [a(n), 2*a(n)] with least part prime(n). There is no prime partition of a(n)-1 having prime(n) as least part, and this is the greatest such number.
%e A333266 For any k >= 4 there exists a prime partition of k having least part 2, hence a(1)=4.
