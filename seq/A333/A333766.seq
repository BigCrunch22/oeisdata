%N A333766 Maximum part of the n-th composition in standard order. a(0) = 0.
%C A333766 One plus the longest run of 0's in the binary expansion of n.
%C A333766 A composition of n is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to n. The k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again. This gives a bijective correspondence between nonnegative integers and integer compositions.
%F A333766 For n > 0, a(n) = A087117(n) + 1.
%e A333766 The 100th composition in standard order is (1,3,3), so a(100) = 3.
