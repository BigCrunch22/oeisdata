%N A333489 Numbers k such that the k-th composition in standard order is an anti-run (no adjacent equal parts).
%C A333489 A composition of n is a finite sequence of positive integers summing to n. The k-th composition in standard order (row k of A066099) is obtained by taking the set of positions of 1's in the reversed binary expansion of k, prepending 0, taking first differences, and reversing again.
