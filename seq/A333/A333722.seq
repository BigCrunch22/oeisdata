%Y A333722 Cf. A333723 (lists the products a(n) * a(n+1) in their order of appearance here), A333724 (lists the biggest substring shared by a(n), a(n+1) and (a(n)*a(n+1)) in their order of appearance here), A262323 (is the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct terms such that the decimal representations of two consecutive terms overlap).
