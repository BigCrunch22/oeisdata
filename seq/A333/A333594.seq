%N A333594 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers such that the decimal expansion of neither a(n)/a(n+1) nor a(n+1)/a(n) contains a significant digit present in either a(n) or a(n+1), with a(1) = 7.
%C A333594 By "significant digit" we mean to exclude from the quotients any zeros preceding the first nonzero digit, as well as zeros following the last nonzero digit (as in a terminating decimal).
%C A333594 Is the sequence infinite?

%e A333594 a(1)/a(2) = 7/14 = .5 and a(2)/a(1) = 14/7 = 2 and their combined distinct significant digits (2,5) are exclusive of the combined distinct digits of a(1) and a(2), (1,4,7).
%e A333594 a(5)/a(6) = 84/77 = 1.090909... and a(6)/a(5) = 77/84 = .916666... and their combined distinct significant digits (0,1,6,9) are exclusive of the combined distinct digits of a(5) and a(6), (4,7,8).
