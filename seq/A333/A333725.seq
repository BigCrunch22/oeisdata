%e A333725 There are no primes between HCN(1) and HCN(2), so a(1) = 0. The next term a(2) is equal to 1 as 3 is the only prime between HCN(2) and HCN(3); the prime 2 is not greater than HCN(2) and so is omitted here. The first gap to contain more than one prime occurs at a(4) = 2, which alludes to 7 and 11 being the only primes contained within HCN(4) and HCN(5).
