%N A333057 Numbers k such that k and k+1 have different (ordered) prime signatures and d_3(k) = d_3(k+1), where d_3 is A007425.
%C A333057 Apparently most of the numbers k such that k and k+1 have the same value of d_3 also have the same prime signature. a(1) = 2024 is the 212th number k such that d_3(k) = d_3(k+1), and up to 10^8 there are 8026247 such numbers k of them only 6414 are not in A052213.

%e A333057 2024 is a term since d_3(2024) = d_3(2025) = 90, and the prime signatures of 2024 = 2^3 * 11 * 23 and 2025 = 3^4 * 5^2 are different ([1, 1, 3] and [2, 4]).
