%N A333826 a(1)=1; for n>1, a(n) = the greatest common divisor (GCD) of n and the sum of all previous terms if the GCD is not already in the sequence; otherwise a(n) = a(n-1) + n.
%C A333826 This is a variation of A337490; here we start with an offset of 1, so a(1) = 1. See that sequence for further details.
%C A333826 In the first 4212 terms the sequence decreases 69 times while 45 terms are repeated, the first being 13 at n=9 and the last 399876 at n=4212. After n(4166)=84 the sequence does not decrease again for n up to at least 100 million. The lowest numbers that have not appeared in that range are 30,37,47,48,49,51. The 100 millionth term is 4999999941527298.

%e A333826 a(2) = 3 as the sum of all previous terms is a(1) = 1, and the GCD of 1 and 2 is 1. However 1 has already appeared so a(2) = a(1) + n = 1 + 2 = 3.
%e A333826 a(4) = 2 as the sum of all previous terms is a(1)+a(2)+a(3) = 10, and the GCD of 10 and 4 is 2, and as 2 has not previous appeared a(4) = 2.
%e A333826 a(8) = 4 as the sum of all previous terms is a(1)+...+a(7) = 52, and the GCD of 52 and 8 is 4, and as 4 has not previous appeared a(8) = 4.
