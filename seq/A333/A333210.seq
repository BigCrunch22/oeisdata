%N A333210 Variation of Van Eck's sequence A181391: a(n+1) = the minimum positive offset m from a(n) such that a(n-m-1)+a(n-m) = a(n-1)+a(n); a(n+1)=0 if no such m exists. Start with a(1) = a(2) = 0.
%C A333210 After 100 million terms the smallest number not appearing is 381884, while the smallest sum of adjacent terms not appearing is 487833.

%e A333210 a(3) = 0 as a(1)+a(2) = 0+0 = 0, which has not previously appeared as the sum of two adjacent terms.
%e A333210 a(4) = 1 as a(2)+a(3) = 0+0 = 0, which equals the sum a(1)+a(2), one term back from a(3).
%e A333210 a(5) = 0 as a(3)+a(4) = 0+1 = 1, which has not previously appeared as the sum of two adjacent terms.
%e A333210 a(6) = 1 as a(4)+a(5) = 1+0 = 1, which equals the sum a(3)+a(4), one term back from a(5).
%e A333210 a(19) = 8 as a(17)+a(18) = 1+3 = 4, which equals the sum a(9)+a(10), eight terms back from a(18).
