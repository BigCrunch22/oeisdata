%N A333590 a(n) = a(n-1) if half of the previous term pairs are inverted. a(n) = a(n-1) + 1 if more than half of the previous term pairs are inverted. a(n) = a(n-1) - 1 if fewer than half of the previous term pairs are inverted. a(1) = 0.
%C A333590 An inversion occurs when some term is greater than some later term.
%C A333590 A sequence of length n can have at most n * (n - 1) / 2 inversions.

%e A333590 There are zero inversions in the first two terms of this sequence. The maximum possible number of inversions in a sequence of length 2 is 1. 0 is less than half of 1, so the third term is 0 - 1 or -1.
%e A333590 There are two inversions in the first 3 terms of this sequence. The maximum possible number of inversions in a sequence of length 3 is 3. 2 is more than half of 3, so the fourth term is -1 + 1 or 0.
