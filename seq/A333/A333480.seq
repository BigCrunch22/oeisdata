%N A333480 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive integers such that the decimal expansions of neither a(n)/a(n+1) nor a(n+1)/a(n) contains a significant digit present in either a(n) or a(n+1).
%C A333480 By "significant digit" we mean to exclude from the quotients any zeros preceding the first nonzero digit, as well as zeros following the last nonzero digit (as in a terminating decimal).
%C A333480 Is the sequence infinite?
%e A333480 a(1)/a(2) = 2/3 = 0.666... and a(2)/a(1) = 3/2 = 1.5 and their combined distinct significant digits (1,5,6) are exclusive of the combined distinct digits of a(1) and a(2), (2,3).
%e A333480 a(7)/a(8) = 11/40 = 0.275 and a(8)/a(7) = 40/11 = 3.636363... and their combined distinct significant digits (2,3,5,6,7) are exclusive of the combined distinct digits of a(7) and a(8), (0,1,4).
%e A333480 a(106)/a(107) = 624/208 = 3 and a(107)/a(106) = 208/624 = 0.333... and their combined distinct significant digits (3) is exclusive of the combined distinct digits of a(106) and a(107), (0,2,4,6,8).
