%N A333614 Lexicographically first sequence of nonnegative integers such that no two terms share all but one digit in common, nor does interchanging any two adjacent digits in any term change it into another term of the sequence.
%C A333614 The rules of this sequence are designed to decrease the likelihood of confusing any two numbers in the sequence. This would be ideal, for example, in the case of generating account numbers.

%e A333614 a(1) = 0 because it is the smallest nonnegative integer.
%e A333614 a(2) = 11 because all integers between 1 and 10 only differ from 0 by one digit.
%e A333614 a(3) = 22 because all integers between 12 and 21 only differ from 11 by one digit.
%e A333614 a(11) = 102 because 101 becomes 011 when interchanging the first two adjacent digits.
