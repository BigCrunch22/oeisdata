%N A250214 Number of values of k such that prime(n) divides A241601(k).
%C A250214 a(n) is called the weak irregular index of n-th prime, that is, the Bernoulli irregular index + Euler irregular index.
%C A250214 Prime(n) is a regular prime if and only if a(n) = 0.
%C A250214 Does every natural number appear in this sequence? For example, for the primes 491 and 1151, a(94) = a(190) = 4. (491 and 1151 are the only primes below 1800 with weak irregular index 4 or more.) However, does a(n) have a limit?

%e A250214 a(8) = 1 since the 8th prime is 19, which divides A241601(11).
%e A250214 a(13) = 0 since the 13th prime is 41, a regular prime.
%e A250214 a(19) = 2 since the 19th prime is 67, which divides both A241601(27) and A241601(58).
