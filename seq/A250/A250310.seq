%N A250310 Numbers whose squares are of the form x^2 + y^2 + 3 where x >= y >= 0 (repetitions omitted).
%C A250310 There exists a K-class of Heronian triangles such that the sum of the tangents of their half angles is a constant K > 1, iff K^2-3 is the sum of two squares. E.g., for K = 2 (x=1, y=0) we generate the class of integer Soddyian triangles (see A034017, A210484). For K = 4 (x=2, y=3) the class generated is Heronian triangles with the ratio of r_i : r_o : r = 1 : 3 : 6 where r is their inradius and r_i, r_o are the radii of their inner and outer Soddy circles.
%C A250310 Also because K^2-3 is the sum of two squares it must be congruent to 1 (mod 4). Consequently K is even.
%C A250310 Numbers k such that k^2-3 is in A001481. - _Robert Israel_, Feb 05 2019
%C A250310 From _William P. Orrick_, Nov 14 2024: (Start)
%C A250310 Let t = z^2 + z + 1 for some nonnegative integer z, and suppose that t = r * s for some positive integers r and s with r > s. Then (x,y) = (2*z + 1,r - s) has the property that x^2 + y^2 + 3 = (r + s)^2. Hence r + s is a member of this sequence.
%C A250310 Given (x,y) such that x^2 + y^2 + 3 is a square, one of x and y is odd, which we can take to be x, and the other even, which we then take to be y. Let z = (x - 1) / 2. Then 4 * (z^2 + z + 1) + y^2 is an even square, which we can call q^2. Hence z^2 + z + 1 factorizes into integer factors r = (q + y) / 2 and s = (q - y) / 2. Therefore all elements of this sequence are obtained by choosing a nonnegative integer z and a factor r of z^2 + z + 1 and forming the sum r + (z^2 + z + 1) / r.
%C A250310 Using the notation of the preceding two comments, the 2 by 2 matrix [[-z,r],[-s,1+z]] has both determinant and trace equal to 1, implying that it is an element of the modular group of order 3. Forming the product of the order-2 matrix [[0,-1],[1,0]] with this matrix gives the matrix [[s,-1-z],[-z,r]], which has trace r + s. Since all elements of the modular group that are a product of an element of order 2 and an element of order 3 can be obtained from a matrix of the form above by conjugation, this sequence consists of the traces of elements of the modular group that can be expressed as such a product. (This ignores the sign of the trace, which is immaterial if matrices are understood to represent fractional linear transformations.)
