%N A250174 Numbers n such that Phi_14(n) is prime, where Phi is the cyclotomic polynomial.
%C A250174 n = 9069 * 2^64163 + 1 is an example of a rather large member of this sequence. The generated 115914 decimal digit prime is proved by the N-1 method (because n is prime and n*(n-1) is fully factored and this provides for an exactly 33.33...% factorization for Phi_14(n) - 1). - _Serge Batalov_, Mar 13 2015

%e A250174 2 is in the sequence because 2^6-2^5+2^4-2^3+2^2-2+1 = 43 which is prime.
