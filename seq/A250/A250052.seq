%N A250052 Conjoined Twin Primes: primes p such that p written in base 10 has a prefix q and a suffix r, where q and r are a pair of twin primes (in either order), and q and r overlap (i.e., strlen(q)+strlen(r)>strlen(p)).
%C A250052 The sequence is finite if the Twin Prime Conjecture is false.

%e A250052 113 is in the sequence because 113 is prime, and (11,13) is a twin prime pair, and "11" is a prefix of "113", and "13" is a suffix of "113", and the prefix and suffix overlap (i.e., strlen("11")+strlen("13")>strlen("113")).
%e A250052 3232321 is in the sequence because 3232321 is prime, and (32321,32323) is a twin prime pair, and "32323" is a prefix of "3232321", and "32321" is a suffix of "3232321", and the prefix and suffix overlap.
