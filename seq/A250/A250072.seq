%N A250072 Permutation of the nonnegative integers such that sum_{k=0..n} (-1)^(a(k)+1)*a(k) is nonnegative and as small as possible, for n=0,1,....
%C A250072 Odd terms are added, even terms are subtracted. At each step, the next term is chosen among numbers which did not yet occur, as to minimize this sum.

%F A250072 a(2n) = 2n+1 for n > 0; a(2^n-1) = 3*2^(n-1)-2 are particularly large "early bird" values (records of a(n)-n), a(2^n-3) = 2^(n-1)-2 are particularly small values (records of n-a(n), and also the values such that all subsequent terms are larger).
