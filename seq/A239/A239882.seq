%N A239882 Number of strict partitions of 2n having an ordering of the parts in which no two neighboring parts have the same parity.
%C A239882 a(n) = number of strict partitions (that is, every part has multiplicity 1) of 2n having an ordering of the parts in which no two neighboring parts have the same parity.  This sequence is nondecreasing, unlike A239881, of which it is a bisection; the other bisection is A239883.
