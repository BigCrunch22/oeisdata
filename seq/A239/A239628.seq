%N A239628 Factored over the Gaussian integers, the least positive number having n prime factors counted multiply, including units -1, i, and -i.
%C A239628 Here -1, i, and -i are counted as factors. The factor 1 is counted only in a(1). All these numbers of products of 2^k, 3, and 9.
%C A239628 Similar to A164073, which gives the least integer having n prime factors (over the Gaussian integers) shifted by 1.
%e A239628 a(2) = 9 because 9 = 3 * 3.
%e A239628 a(3) = 2 because 2 = -i * (1 + i)^2.
%e A239628 a(4) = 6 because 6 = -i * (1 + i)^2 * 3.

%Y A239628 Cf. A001221, A001222 (integer factorizations).
%Y A239628 Cf. A078458, A086275 (Gaussian factorizations).
%Y A239628 Cf. A164073 (least number having n Gaussian factors, excluding units);
%Y A239628 Cf. A239627 (number of Gaussian factors of n, including units).
%Y A239628 Cf. A239629, A239630 (similar, but count distinct prime factors).
