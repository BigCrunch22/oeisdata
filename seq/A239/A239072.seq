%N A239072 Maximum number of cells in an n X n square grid that can be painted such that no two orthogonally adjacent cells are painted and every unpainted cell can be reached from the edge of the grid by a series of orthogonal steps to unpainted cells.
%C A239072 This sequence has implications for constructing Steiner trees for square unit arrays of dots: an orthogonal-only tree for an m X m dot array would need m^2-1 units. The value of a(m-1) tells you how many (1+sqrt(3)) 'X' shapes you can place in the grid, each saving (2-sqrt(3)) units.
%C A239072 Unfortunately this doesn't generally lead to the minimal Steiner tree.
%C A239072 An upper bound for this sequence is (((n+1)^2)-1)/3, which is reached iff n = 2^k-1.
%C A239072 The value of a(n)/n^2 (the painted cells as a proportion of all of the cells) converges extremely slowly to 1/3.
%C A239072 This sequence is related to the sequence of Heyawake numbers A239231, which has the additional criterion that the unpainted area should be contiguous. For sufficiently large Heyawake grids, this sequence forms the central (n-4) X (n-4) square of the Heyawake grid.
%e A239072 For example, if n=6, the painted cells could be A1, A3, A5, B2, B6, C1, C3, C5, D6, E1, E3, E5, F2, F4, F6 (15 cells in all).
%Y A239072 Cf. A239231, a similar sequence, with one extra criterion - that the unpainted cells should be contiguous.
