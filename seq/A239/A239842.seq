%N A239842 Numbers n such that the Eisenstein integer ((1-ω)^n+1)/(2-ω) has prime norm, where ω = - 1/2 + sqrt(-3)/2.
%C A239842 These numbers are sometimes called Eisenstein-Mersenne cofactors EQ(n).
%C A239842 The p-th Eisenstein-Mersenne cofactor can be written as EQ(p) = (3^p + Legendre(3, p) * 3^((p + 1)/2) + 1)/7.
%C A239842 Following an idea of Harsh Aggarwal, some of these numbers have been discovered as by-products of the search for prime Eisenstein-Mersenne norms. The reason of that is the Aurifeuillan factorization of T(k) = 3^(3k) + 1 with k odd. These numbers can be written as T(k) = (3^k + 1)*EM(k)*EQ(k)*7, EM(k) is the norm of the Eisenstein-Mersenne (1-ω)^k-1, while EQ(k) is the norm of ((1-ω)^a[n]+1)/(2-ω).
%C A239842 These numbers have been proved prime only up to exponent a(19) = 20047.
%C A239842 Next term a(28) > 1500000.

%e A239842 For n = 3: ((1-ω)^31+1)/(2-ω) is an Eisenstein prime because its norm, (3^31-3^16+1)/7 = 88239050462461, is prime.
