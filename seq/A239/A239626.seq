%N A239626 Factored over the Gaussian integers, n has a(n) prime factors counted multiply, including units -1, i, and -i.
%C A239626 Here -1, i, and -i are counted as factors. The factor 1 is counted only in a(1).

%e A239626 a(2) = 3 because 2 = -i * (1 + i)^2.
%e A239626 a(3) = 1 because 3 is prime over the complex numbers.
%e A239626 a(4) = 5 because 4 = -1 * (1 + i)^4.
