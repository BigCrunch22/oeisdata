%N A239669 Total number of prime factors counted with multiplicity of prime(n)-1 and prime(n)+1, where prime(n) is the n-th prime.
%C A239669 If a(n) <= 6, n is a distinguished prime (A106639). According to a conjecture in A106639, 6 is the least term appearing infinitely often. Numerical evidence suggests the conjecture that other - perhaps all - integers > 6 appear infinitely often. The strong conjecture implies that all terms but one in A155800 are positive.

%F A239669 a(n) = Omega(prime(n)^2 - 1), where Omega is A001222.
%e A239669 a(7) = 7 as prime(7) = 17, 17-1 = 2^4 and 17+1 = 2*3^2, so total number of prime factors = 4+3 = 7.
