%N A239516 Number of partitions p of n that are separable by the 2*min(p); see Comments.
%C A239516 Suppose that p is a partition of n into 2 or more parts and that h is a part of p. Then p is (h,0)-separable if there is an ordering x, h, x, h, ..., h, x of the parts of p, where each x represents any part of p except h.  Here, the number of h's on the ends of the ordering is 0. Similarly, p is (h,1)-separable if there is an ordering x, h, x, h, ..., x, h, where the number of h's on the ends is 1; next, p is (h,2)-separable if there is an ordering h, x, h, ..., x, h. Finally, p is h-separable if it is (h,i)-separable for i = 0,1, or 2.
%e A239516 Let h = 2*min(p). The (h,0)-separable partition of 8 is 521; the (h,1)-separable partition is 3212; the (h,2)-separable partitions are 242, 21212. So, there are 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 h-separable partitions of 8.
