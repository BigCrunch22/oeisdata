%N A239518 Number of partitions p of n that are separable by the number of parts of p; see Comments.
%C A239518 Suppose that p is a partition of n into 2 or more parts and that h is a part of p. Then p is (h,0)-separable if there is an ordering x, h, x, h, ..., h, x of the parts of p, where each x represents any part of p except h. Here, the number of h's on the ends of the ordering is 0. Similarly, p is (h,1)-separable if there is an ordering x, h, x, h, ..., x, h, where the number of h's on the ends is 1; next, p is (h,2)-separable if there is an ordering h, x, h, ..., x, h. Finally, p is h-separable if it is (h,i)-separable for i = 0, 1, or 2.
%e A239518 Let h = number of parts of p. The (h,0)-separable partition of 11 are 92, 731, 632, 434; the (h,1)-separable partition is 2414; the (h,2)-partition is 353. So, there are 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 h-separable partitions of 11.
