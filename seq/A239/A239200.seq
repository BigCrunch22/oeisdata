%N A239200 Expansion of Pi in the irrational base b=log(7).
%C A239200 The negative offset is chosen as to have Pi = sum(a(i)*b^-i, i=offset...+oo), with the base b=log(7), cf. Example.
%C A239200 Log(7) is the largest base of the form log(n) < 2, such that the expansion has only digits 1 and 0 (and can therefore also be recorded in a condensed way by just listing the positions of nonzero digits, cf. example). Sqrt(3) has this maximal property for bases of the form sqrt(n).

%e A239200 Pi = log(7)^1 + log(7)^0 + log(7)^-3 + log(7)^-5 + ... = [1,1;0,0,1,0,1,1,...]_{log(7)}, which could also be encoded as (1,0,-3,-5,...) or (-1,0,3,5,...) (sequence of which the present one is the characteristic function).

%o A239200 base(Pi) \\ returns this sequence as a vector (whose components are indexed by 1,2,3... instead of -1,0,1,...).
