%N A239722 Numbers that end in (..., 384, 384, 384, ...) under the rule: next term = product of the last four digits in the sequence so far.
%C A239722 Additional rule: If there are fewer than k=4 digits in the sequence so far, then it is "extended to the left" with the first digit (i.e., that digit is repeated as often as necessary).
%C A239722 Apart from the trivial cycles (0) (cf. A239616) and (1) and the cycle (384) considered here, the rule also allows the "constant" cycle (175), cf. A239721.
%o A239722 (PARI) is_A239722(n) = A238984(99,n,4)==384 \\ The "99" here should be large enough to reach the cycle (384), for small initial values n. It might be necessary to increase this value in other cases.
%Y A239722 Cf. A238984, A239419, A239616, A239721.
