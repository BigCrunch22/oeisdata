%e A239353 When the radius of the sphere reaches 2, one cube is completely within the sphere. When the radius reaches 7^(1/2), five cubes are completely within the sphere.
%Y A239353 Cf. A237707 (3-dimensional analog), A232499 (2-dimensional analog). The square radii corresponding to the elements of {a(n)} are the indices of the nonzero terms of A025428.
