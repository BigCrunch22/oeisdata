%N A239419 Numbers that end in the trivial cycle (0) under the rule: next term = product of the last three digits of the concatenated preceding terms.
%C A239419 Additional rule: As long as there are less than k=3 digits in the sequence, the first digit is repeated as often as necessary, e.g. 3 => 3*3*3 = 27 => 3*2*7 = 42 => 7*4*2 = 56 => 2*5*6 = 60 => 6*6*0 = 0 => 6*0*0 => 0, ...
%C A239419 See A238984 for more details, motivation and links.
%o A239419 (PARI) is_A239419(n) = !A238984(99,n) \\ Here, the somewhat arbitrary value 99 (number of iterations before checking for 0) should be sufficiently large for small n, but might need to be increased for larger starting values n.
