%S A239060 1,125,17692313
%N A239060 Nonprime numbers whose divisors all appear as a substring in the number's decimal expansion.
%C A239060 This is the subsequence of A239058 without the primes having a digit 1, A208270. It is thus a subsequence of A092911 (all divisors can be formed using the digits of the number) which is a subsequence of A011531 (numbers having the digit 1).
%C A239060 The term a(3)=17692313=A239058(870356), as well as the numbers 4482669527413081, 21465097175420089, and 567533481816008761 which are also members, were found by _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Mar 09 2014
%C A239060 The square of any term of A115738 is a member of this sequence. The above larger examples are of that form.
%C A239060 a(4) > 10^12. - _Giovanni Resta_, Sep 08 2018
