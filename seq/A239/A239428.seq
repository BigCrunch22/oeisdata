%N A239428 Number of ordered ways to write n = k + m with 0 < k <= m such that pi(2*k) - pi(k) and pi(2*m) - pi(m) are both prime, where pi(x) denotes the number of primes not exceeding x.
%C A239428 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 9, and a(n) = 1 only for n = 8, 10, 11, 26, 33, 50, 52.
%C A239428 This implies that there are infinitely many positive integers n with pi(2*n) - pi(n) prime.
%C A239428 Recall that Bertrand's postulate proved by Chebyshev in 1850 asserts that pi(2*n) - pi(n) > 0 for all n > 0.

%e A239428 a(11) = 1 since 11 = 4 + 7 with pi(2*4) - pi(4) = 4 - 2 = 2 and pi(2*7) - pi(7) = 6 - 4 = 2 both prime.
%e A239428 a(26) = 1 since 26 = 13 + 13 with pi(2*13) - pi(13) = 9 - 6 = 3 prime.
%e A239428 a(33) = 1 since 33 = 6 + 27 with pi(2*6) - pi(6) = 5 - 3 = 2 and pi(2*27) - pi(27) = 16 - 9 = 7 both prime.
%e A239428 a(50) = 1 since 50 = 23 + 27 with pi(2*23) - pi(23) = 14 - 9 = 5 and pi(2*27) - pi(27) = 16 - 9 = 7 both prime.
%e A239428 a(52) = 1 since 52 = 21 + 31 with pi(2*21) - pi(21) = 13 - 8 = 5 and pi(2*31) - pi(31) = 18 - 11 = 7 both prime.
