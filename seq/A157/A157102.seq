%N A157102 Tuple-chromatic Van der Waerden numbers.
%C A157102 See links for definition. Specifically, the terms of this sequence are the first several terms of tcW(r,r-1,r), where r=2,3,4,.... Informally, the function tcW is like the multi-color Van der Waerden function W, except that the second parameter determines the number of colors found in the target subsequence. If W(r,k) is the standard multi-color Van der Waerden function with r colors and a required monochrome arithmetic subsequence of length k, then tcW(r,1,k) = W(r,k). In tcW(r,1,k), the 1 would indicate a monochrome subsequence. For tcW(r,2,k) an arithmetic subsequence of length k in 1 OR 2 colors would match the criteria. For tcW(r,3,k) an arithmetic subsequence of length k in 1, 2, or 3 colors suffices.
%C A157102 a(r) = tcW(r,r-1,r).

%e A157102 a(2) = tcW(2,1,2) = W(2,2) = 3. If {1,2,3} is colored in 2 colors, then a 2 term arithmetic subsequence exists in 1 color (monochrome).
%e A157102 a(3) = tcW(3,2,3) = 7. If {1,...,7} is colored in 3 colors, then a 3 term arithmetic subsequence exists that is colored in at most 2 colors.

%o A157102 (C++) See Kelly link. It is not the best program, but it is relatively fast. To get the terms of the above sequence, you have to compile the program and choose parameters such as: find_vdw 10000 5 4 5 for tcW(5,4,5) and find_vdw 10000 6 5 6 for tcW(6,5,6).
