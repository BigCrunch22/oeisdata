%N A157430 Primes of the form 9*(p^4)-2 or 9*(p^4)+2, arising in Paley-Hadamard difference sets.
%C A157430 Polhill is able to construct Paley-Hadamard difference sets of the Stanton-Sprott family in groups of the form (Z_3)^2 X (Z_p)^4t X (Z_(9p^4t)+2 or -2 when 9*(p^4t)-2 or 9*(p^4t)+2 is a prime power. In this sequence, we are taking just the t=1 case, a prime power as first power of prime.

%e A157430 a(1) = 9*(3^4) - 2 = 727 is prime. a(2) = 9*(5^4) - 2 = 5623 is prime. a(3) = 9*(7^4) + 2 = 21611. a(4) = 9*(11^4) + 2 = 131771. a(5) = 9*(17^4) + 2 = 751691. a(6) = 9*(31^4) - 2 = 8311687. a(7) = 9*(37^4) - 2 = 16867447. a(8) = 9*(41^4) + 2 = 25431851.
