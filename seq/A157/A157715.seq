%N A157715 Primes sorted on digit sums, then on the primes.
%C A157715 Beyond n = 4, a(n) is believed to coincide with A062339.
%C A157715 Only correct for n >= 4 if an undiscovered prime of digit sum two (which would have to be a member of A080176) does not exist; this is conjectured but not proved. - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Mar 30 2018
%e A157715 There are only three primes with a digit sum of 2, and those are 2, 11, 101. Therefore these three primes are the first three terms of this sequence.
%e A157715 There is only one prime with a digit sum of 3, and that's 3 itself. Any higher number with a digit sum of 3 is a nontrivial multiple of 3 and therefore composite.
%e A157715 Then follows the first prime with a digit sum of 4, which is 13.
