%N A157238 0-1 sequence generated by starting with a 0, and then by using whichever of 0, 1 will result in the shortest sequence repeated at the end.
%C A157238 The same as the Linus sequence (A006345): a(n) "breaks the pattern" by avoiding the longest doubled suffix, but using 0's and 1's. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Dec 01 2013
%F A157238 a(n) = A006345(n) - 1. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Dec 02 2013
%e A157238 a(6)=1 as 0,1,0,0,1,1 has a longest repeated sequence of length 1 at the end, whereas 0,1,0,0,1,0 has a longest repeated sequence of length 3 at the end. Similarly, a(7)=0 since 0,1,0,0,1,1,0 has a longest repeated sequence of length 0 at the end.
