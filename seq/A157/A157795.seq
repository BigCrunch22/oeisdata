%N A157795 Largest subset of the discrete triangular grid { (a,b,c): a+b+c = n, a,b,c >= 0 } that does not contain any upward-pointing triangles (i.e., triples (a+r,b,c), (a,b+r,c), (a,b,c+r) with r positive).
%C A157795 The n=3 case was posed as a problem by Fujimura. The sequence is related to a certain "hyper-optimistic conjecture" regarding the density Hales-Jewett theorem.

%e A157795 For n=2, a four-point set without triangles is (2,0,0), (0,0,2), (1,1,0), (0,1,1).
