%e A157891 a(0) = 0 since 2 is adjacent to 3 (exponent of 2nd Mersenne prime).
%e A157891 a(2) = 1 since 4 is between 3 and 5 (exponent of 3rd Mersenne prime).
%e A157891 a(3) = 1 since 6 is between 5 and 7 (exponent of 4th Mersenne prime).
%e A157891 a(4) = 5 since 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 are between 7 and 13 (exponent 5th Mersenne prime).
