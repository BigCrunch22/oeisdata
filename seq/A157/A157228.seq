%N A157228 Number of primitive inequivalent inclined square sublattices of square lattice of index n.
%C A157228 From _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, May 09 2018: (Start)
%C A157228 Also, the number of partitions of n into 2 distinct coprime squares.
%C A157228 All such sublattices (including non-primitive ones) are counted in A025441.
%C A157228 The primitive sublattices that have the same symmetries (including the orientation of the mirrors) as the parent lattice are not counted here; they are counted in A019590, and all such sublattices (including non-primitive ones) are counted in A053866.
%C A157228 For n > 2, equals A193138. (End)

%F A157228 a(n) = (A000089(n) - A019590(n)) / 2. - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, May 09 2018
%F A157228 a(n) = 1 if n>2 is in A224450, a(n) = 2 if n is in A224770, a(n) is a higher power of 2 if n is in A281877 (first time reaches 8 at n = 32045). - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Sep 30 2018
%F A157228 a(n) = b(n) for odd n, a(n) = b(n/2) for even n, where b(n) = A024362(n). - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Jan 23 2022
