%N A157890 Number of primes between exponents of successive Mersenne primes.
%C A157890 a(6) = 0 since 17 is adjacent to 19 (exponent of 7th Mersenne prime); a(7) = 2 since 23 and 29 are between 19 and 31 (exponent of 8th Mersenne prime); a(8) = 6 since 37, 41, 43, 47, 53 and 59 are between 31 and 61 (exponent of 9th Mersenne prime)
%F A157890 a(n) = (PrimePi(A000043(n+1))-PrimePi(A000043(n)))-1 = (A000720(A000043(n+1))-A000720(A000043(n)))-1. [From _Jonathan Vos Post_, Mar 09 2009]
