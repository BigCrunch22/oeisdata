%N A157717 Primes that start a run of at least seven consecutive primes, where between successive primes exactly one digit changes and the resulting digits may be permuted.
%C A157717 One and only one digit can change between any two successive primes in a run.
%C A157717 Rearrangement is optionally permitted to arrive at next consecutive prime in run.
%C A157717 Leading zeros are not permitted; all numbers in the run must have the same number of digits.
%e A157717 311 is in the sequence because it begins a run of seven consecutive primes as required:
%e A157717 311 (1->3) 313 (3->7) 317 (7->3,swap 1&3) 331 (1->7) 337 (3->4) 347 (7->9) 349.
%e A157717 401 starts a run of nine: 401, 409, 419, 421, 431, 433, 439, 443, 449.
%e A157717 Note that 409 and 419 are not included since they are not the start of the run.
