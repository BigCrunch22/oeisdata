%N A157756 Integers n such that by splitting their digits in two equal parts, the difference between the square of the first part and the second part eventually reaches 0 by iterating the process. If length is odd, split (length+1)/2, (length-1)/2.
%C A157756 Example 3480 belongs to the sequence, because 34^2 - 80 = 1076 --> 10^2 - 76 = 24 --> 2^2 - 4 = 0.
