%N A157940 Numbers n divisible by the largest prime <= sqrt(n) which are not in A001248 (primes squared) or A006094 (product of two consecutive primes).
%C A157940 A subsequence of A157941.
%F A157940 A157940 = A157942 \ A157936 = A157941 \ A006094, where A157941 = A157942 \ A001248.
%e A157940 For numbers less than 4 the definition does not make sense, since there's no prime < 2=sqrt(4).
%e A157940 a(1)=8 which is divisible by 2 = precprime(sqrt(8)) and neither a prime squared (as would be 4 and 9) nor product of consecutive primes.
%e A157940 5 and 7 are not in this sequence, since not a multiple of 2=precprime(sqrt(5)) =precprime(sqrt(7)).
%e A157940 6 is not in the sequence, since it is the product of 2=precprime(sqrt(6)) and the following prime, 3. For the same reason, 15 is excluded.
