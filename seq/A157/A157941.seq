%N A157941 Numbers n divisible by the largest prime < sqrt(n), A007917(A000196(n-1)).
%C A157941 Includes products of pairs of consecutive primes (A006094) as subsequence, equals A157942 with squares of primes (A001248) removed.
%C A157941 For a number < 5 the definition does not make much sense, since there is no prime < sqrt(4) = 2, so we don't consider them here.
