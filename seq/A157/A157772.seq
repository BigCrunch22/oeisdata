%N A157772 Numbers n such that 100n + 13 is prime.
%C A157772 The sequence is infinite, because by Dirichlet's theorem there are infinitely many primes in the arithmetic sequence A*n+B (n=1,2,...) if A an B are relatively prime.
%C A157772 The sequence also has an infinite set of pairs a(k+1)=a(k)+1 (two consecutive naturals), but no set of three consecutive naturals (each third natural is divisible by 3)
%C A157772 No term of the sequence is of form 3k+2, because the sum of digits of 100*(3k+2)+13 is divisible by 3, violating the requirement of the definition.
%C A157772 Indices (as k-th prime) of the first members are 6, 30, 65, 112, 170, 198, 255, 293, 319, 330, 396, 466, 480, 505, 554, 612, 648, 684, 714, 763, 797, 902, 922, 1061, 1086, 1121, 1164, 1186, 1265, 1286, 1295, ...
%F A157772 {a(n): 100*a(n)+13 in A000040}.
%e A157772 a(1)=0: 100*0+13=13 smallest prime which ends in 13, see A000040(6).
%e A157772 a(2)=1: 100*1+13=113 second prime which ends in 13, see A000040(30).
