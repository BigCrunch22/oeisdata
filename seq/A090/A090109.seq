%N A090109 Values of n such that P[n]=n^2-79n+1601 is prime and also {P[n+1],...,P[n+11-1]} are prime numbers. Namely: a(n)= the first argument providing 11 "polynomially consecutive" primes with respect of polynomial=x^2-79x+1601 described by Escott in 1899.
%e A090109 n=1 provides the following non-monotonic[ ! ] chain of 11 "polynomially consecutive" primes as follows: {1523, 1447, 1373, 1301, 1231, 1163, 1097, 1033, 971, 911, 853}.
