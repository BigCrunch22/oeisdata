%N A090972 Least k such that there are at least n primes between n and n*k.
%C A090972 a(9) = 5 is saying that there are 9 primes between 9 and 45, but actually there are 10: 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43. - _Michel Marcus_, Nov 20 2017
%e A090972 a(11) = 5 as there are 11 primes (13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53) between 11 and 55.
