%N A090847 Let A denote the sequence; then A is equal to the union of the self-convolutions A^2 and A^4, with terms in ascending order by size, where a(0)=1.
%C A090847 The occurrences of the terms of A^4 in A is given by A090848. Given A(m)=A^4(n), then what is the limit m/n as n grows? Example: at n=2000, m/n=3202/2000=2.616, at n=3000, m/n=7849/3000=2.6163...
%e A090847 A={1,1,2,4,5,12,14,22,44,50,88,117,...} since A is the sorted union of:
%e A090847 A^2={1,2,5,12,22,50,88,160,309,508,912,1518,2470,4280,6606,10764,...} and
%e A090847 A^4={1,4,14,44,117,308,740,1700,3822,8164,17158,35020,69664,136920,...}.
