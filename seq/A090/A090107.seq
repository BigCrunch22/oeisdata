%N A090107 Values of n such that P[n]=n^2-79n+1601 is prime and also {P[n+1],...,P[n+10-1]} are prime numbers. Namely: a(n)= the first argument providing 10 "polynomially consecutive" primes with respect of polynomial=x^2-79x+1601 described by Escott in 1899.
%e A090107 n=106 provides chain of 10 "polynomially consecutive" primes as follows:{4463, 4597, 4733, 4871, 5011, 5153, 5297, 5443, 5591, 5741}
