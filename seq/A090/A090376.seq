%N A090376 Number of rooted generalized quadrangular dissections of weight n of a closed disk: planar maps having the external face bounded by a polygon and all internal faces of size 4.
%C A090376 Some boundary mutually non-adjacent nodes of valency 2 are marked as singular; (boundary) edges incident to them are also called singular. The maps are considered up to rotations and reflections. Rooting means distinguishing a non-singular edge, an end and an internal side of it. n is the number of internal edges plus half of the number of non-singular boundary edges.
%C A090376 No formula is known. For any generalized quadrangular dissection, s==n (mod 2), where s is the number of singular nodes.
