%N A090465 Smallest number m such that n followed by m nines yields a prime or -1 if no solution exists or has been found for n.
%C A090465 a(n) = 0 if n is already prime. a(n) = -1 for n = any multiple of 3 other than 3 itself. The first 9 record holders in this sequence are 1, 4, 25, 28, 46, 88, 374, 416, 466 with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 16, 33, 57, 70, 203 respectively.
%e A090465 a(25)=3 because three 9's must be appended to 25 before a prime is formed (25999). a(6) = -1 because no matter how many 9's are appended to 6, the resulting number is always divisible by 3 and can therefore not be prime.
%Y A090465 Cf. A083747 (The Wilde Primes, i.e. same operation using ones), A090464 (using sevens), A090584 (using threes).
