%N A090465 Smallest number m such that n followed by m nines yields a prime or -1 if no solution exists or has been found for n.
%C A090465 The first 9 record holders in this sequence are 1, 4, 25, 28, 46, 88, 374, 416, 466 with the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 16, 33, 57, 70, 203 respectively.
%C A090465 The next 3 record holders are 1342, 1802, 1934 with the values 29711, 45882, 51836 respectively. 4420 may be the next record holder as no solution has been found for it yet. 4420 was tested out to 300000 nines with no prime formed. - _Toshitaka Suzuki_, May 27 2024

%F A090465 a(p) = 0 for p prime.
%F A090465 a(n) = -1 if n is a proper multiple of 3.
%e A090465 a(25) = 3 because three 9's must be appended to 25 before a prime is formed (25999).
%e A090465 a(6) = -1 because no matter how many 9's are appended to 6, the resulting number is always divisible by 3 and can therefore not be prime.
%Y A090465 Cf. A083747 (The Wilde Primes, i.e. same operation using ones), A090464 (using sevens), A090584 (using threes).
