%N A090651 Perpetual calendar sequence: There are 14 basic year calendars, 7 for normal years and 7 for leap years. This sequence identifies the calendars for years 1901 through 2099, when it reinitializes because 2100 is not a leap year.
%C A090651 2000 was a leap year, so no reinitializing was needed.
%C A090651 Calendars are continuous so they roll from Dec 31 to Jan 01. The intercalation of the leap years causes the unusual sequence.
%C A090651 a(n) = 1 for years starting on a Sunday, 2 for years starting on a Monday, so on to 7; 8 for leap years starting on a Sunday, 9 for leap years starting on Monday, so on to 14. - _Alonso del Arte_, Nov 02 2004
