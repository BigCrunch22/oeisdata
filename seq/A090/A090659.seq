%N A090659 Odd composites with increasing proportion of nontrivial non-witnesses of compositeness by the Miller-Rabin primality test.
%C A090659 Rabin has shown that the proportion has an upper bound of 0.25. If the trivial non-witnesses are counted, this upper bound is reached at 9. If the conjecture is true that the later terms are always the product of two primes p and (2*p-1), then the sequence continues 188191 218791 269011 286903 385003 497503 597871 736291 765703 954271 1056331 1314631 1869211 2741311 3270403 3913003 4255903 4686391 5292631.
%C A090659 Dickson's conjecture implies that this sequence is infinite. Can this be proved unconditionally? - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Mar 10 2011
%C A090659 Higgins' conjecture 2 is implied by his conjecture 1, which is true by the general form of the number of non-witnesses of an odd number. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Mar 10 2011

%e A090659 25 has 2 nontrivial non-witnesses (NTNW), namely (7,18), for a proportion of 2/22=0.0909. The denominator is 22 because the non-witnesses are selected from 2..23 (as 1 and 24 are trivial non-witnesses).
%e A090659 49 has 4 NTNW, namely (18,19,30,31) for a proportion of 4/46=0.0870. This is a smaller proportion than 0.0909 for 25.
%e A090659 91=7*13 has 16 NTNW in the range [2..89], namely [9, 10, 12, 16, 17, 22, 29, 38, 53, 62, 69, 74, 75, 79, 81, 82], for a proportion of 16/88=0.182. It also has two trivial non-witnesses 1 and 90, which are not counted. The next integer with a higher proportion is 703, with 160 nontrivial non-witnesses and proportion 0.229.
