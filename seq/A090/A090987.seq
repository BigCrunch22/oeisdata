%N A090987 a(n) is the smallest prime whose square divides the numerator of the Bernoulli number B(A090997(n)).
%C A090987 It appears that, except for irregular primes belonging to A094095, such as a(5) = 103, a(8) = 37 and a(26) = 59, all regular prime a(n) = p divide the corresponding numerators of the Bernoulli numbers B(A090997(n)) with indices of the form 2*k*p^2, where k > 0 is an integer. - _Alexander Adamchuk_, Aug 19 2006
