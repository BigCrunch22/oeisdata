%N A090067 Numbers n such that there are (presumably) six palindromes in the Reverse and Add! trajectory of n.
%C A090067 For terms < 2000 each palindrome is reached from the preceding one or from the start in at most 24 steps; after the presumably last one no further palindrome is reached in 2000 steps.

%e A090067 The trajectory of 154 begins 154, 605, 1111, 2222, 4444, 8888, 17776, 85547, 160105, 661166, 1322332, 3654563, 7309126, ...; at 7309126 it joins the (presumably) palindrome-free trajectory of A063048(7) = 10577, hence 525, 1551, 5115, 13431, 26862 and 12455421 are the six palindromes in the trajectory of 154 and 154 is a term.
%Y A090067 Cf. A023108, A023109, A065001, A070742, A077594.
