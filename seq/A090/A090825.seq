%N A090825 Nonprimes n such that (3/2)*(1/n)*(2*n+1)*(3^n+1)*B(2*n) is an integer, where B(k) denotes the k-th Bernoulli number.
%C A090825 Conjecture: composite numbers with all prime factors in A053176 are in the sequence. For p prime (3/2)*(1/p)*(2*p+1)*(3^p+1)*B(2*p) == 1 (mod p). There are few terms n with (3/2)*(1/n)*(2*n+1)*(3^n+1)*B(2*n) == 1 (mod n): 91,247,....Is this subsequence finite?
