%N A090064 Numbers n such that there are (presumably) three palindromes in the Reverse and Add! trajectory of n.
%C A090064 For terms < 2000 each palindrome is reached from the preceding one or from the start in at most 24 steps; after the presumably last one no further palindrome is reached in 2000 steps.

%e A090064 The trajectory of 113 begins 113, 424, 848, 1696, 8657, 16225, 68486, 136972, 416603, ...; at 416603 it joins the (presumably) palindrome-free trajectory of A063048(16) = 10735, hence 424, 848 and 68486 are the three palindromes in the trajectory of 113 and 113 is a term.
%Y A090064 Cf. A023108, A023109, A065001, A070742, A077594.
