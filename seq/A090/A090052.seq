%N A090052 Group-abundant numbers: n such that the number of groups of order n (A000001) exceeds n.
%C A090052 It seems fairly certain that 1 is the only group-perfect number and that almost all numbers are group-deficient. However, all that is known at present is that all squarefree numbers except 1 are group-deficient.

%e A090052 32 is in the sequence because A000001(32) = 51 > 32, 48 is in the sequence because A000001(48) = 52 > 48 and since the exact number of groups of order 2048 that have exponent-2 class 2 is 1774274116992170 then 2048 is in the sequence because A000001(2048) > 1774274116992170 > 2048. - _Muniru A Asiru_, Nov 26 2017
