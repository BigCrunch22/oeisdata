%N A090482 Smallest prime p such that tau(p-1) + tau(p+1) is n, or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A090482 a(9)=0. Proof: Both p-1 and p+1 are even and composite hence 9=1+8 and 9=2+7 are ruled out, the only possibilities that remain are 9 = 3+6, or 9=4+5. 3+6 is ruled out as 4 is the only even number with 3 divisors. 4+5 is ruled out as 16 is the only even number with 5 divisors.
%C A090482 a(15) = a(19) = 0 is also provable. - _David Wasserman_, Nov 17 2005
%F A090482 Least prime p such that A175144(p) = n.
%e A090482 a(10) = 11, tau(10) = 4 and tau(12) = 6, 4+6=10.
