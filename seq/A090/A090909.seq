%C A090909 From _Michel Dekking_, Dec 18 2024: (Start)
%C A090909 Proof of Mihailovs's conjecture: This follows immediately from the result in my 2023 paper in JIS that A073869 is equal to Hofstadter’s G-sequence A005206, and my recent comment in A005206 on the pairs of duplicate values in A005206.
%C A090909 The answer to Russell’s question is well-known, and also Detlef’s formula is well-known.
%C A090909 Originally, this sequence was given the name “Terms a(k) of A073869 for which a(k-1), a(k) and a(k+1) are distinct.’’ These are the triples (1,2,3),(4,5,6),(6,7,8), (9,10,11), ... occurring at  k = 3, k = 8, k = 11, k = 16,... in A005206. Note that if a duplicate pair (a(m-1), a(m)) is followed directly by another duplicate pair, then a(m-3), a(m-2) and a(m-1) are distinct, and only so. This corresponds to the block 00 occurring in the Fibonacci word obtained by projecting A005206 on the Fibonacci word (see Corollary in my recent comment in A005206). These occurrences are at the Wythoff AB numbers A003623 according to Wolfdieter Lang’s comment in A003623. Conclusion: the sequence of terms a(k) of A073869 for which a(k-1), a(k), and a(k+1) are distinct is given by the Wythoff AB-numbers. (End)
