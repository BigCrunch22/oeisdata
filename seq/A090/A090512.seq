%N A090512 Least multiple of n such that the n-th concatenation is a multiple of n. The (previous) (n-1)-th term is so chosen that the n-th term exists.
%C A090512 If n+1 has any prime divisors other than 2 or 5, then a(n) is to be chosen so that the concatenation of first n terms is a multiple of those primes (including multiplicity). - _David Wasserman_, Dec 20 2005
%e A090512 a(5) = 15 because if it were 5 or 10, a(6) would not exist.
