%N A090464 Smallest number m such that n followed by m sevens yields a prime or -1 if no solution exists or has been found for n.
%C A090464 a(n) = 0 if n is already prime. a(n) = -1 for n = any multiple of 7 other than 7 itself. Each multiple of 7 has been tested out to 2000 7's with no result found. The first eight values of n which are not multiples of 7 for which no answer has yet been found are 95, 480, 851, 891, 957, 1184, 1261, 1881. 95 has been tested out to 2100 7's, 1881 has been tested out to 1750 7's, the others have been tested out to 2000 7's. Pending solutions for these values of n, the first 10 record holders are currently 1, 8, 20, 40, 120, 128, 225, 260, 296, 711 with the values 1, 2, 6, 12, 16, 18, 56, 182, 434, 1648 respectively.
%e A090464 a(20)=6 because six 7's must be appended to 20 before a prime is formed (20777777). a(14) = -1 because no matter how many 7's are appended to 14, the resulting number is always divisible by 7 and can therefore not be prime.
%Y A090464 Cf. A083747 (The Wilde Primes, i.e. same operation using ones), A090465 (using nines), A090584 (using threes).
