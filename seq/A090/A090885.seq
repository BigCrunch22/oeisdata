%N A090885 Sum of the squares of the exponents in the prime factorization of n.
%C A090885 From _Daniel Forgues_, Mar 30 2009: (Start)
%C A090885 Euclidean norm (square of the length as measured from the origin 0 which represents the number 1) of the exponents vector of n.
%C A090885 If we consider n as represented as an exponents vector in an infinite dimensional discrete vector space (infinite dimensional lattice) where each dimension corresponds to a prime {p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, ...} = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...} then the product of n1 with n2 corresponds to vector addition of the exponents vectors of n1 and n2.
%C A090885 If 2 numbers n1 and n2 are coprime then the length of the exponents vector of the product n1*n2 is the Pythagorean sum of the lengths of the exponents vectors of n1 and n2.
%C A090885 For the product of 2 arbitrary numbers n1 and n2 we have the triangle inequality applying to the lengths of the exponents vectors of n1, n2, n1*n2. E.g., 107653 = 7^2 * 13^3 is represented as (0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, ...) as an exponents vector in an infinite dimensional space associated with the primes.
%C A090885 If all the coordinates of the exponents vector are positive we have the representation of an integer. If some components are negative then we have the representation of a rational number. The origin 0 corresponds to the number 1. There is no representation for 0 as an exponents vector.
%C A090885 If 2 numbers are coprime then their exponents vectors are orthogonal. If the exponents vectors of 2 numbers n1 and n2 are parallel then we have n1^a = n2^b for some nonzero integers a and b. (End)
