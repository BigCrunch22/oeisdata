%N A090315 Least k such that k and digit reversal of k both have n divisors, or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A090315 For a(7) one needs a number of the form p^6 whose digit reversal is q^6, p, q are primes. Hence a(7) perhaps is zero (not sure). Conjecture: There are infinitely many nonzero terms as well as zeros in this sequence.
%C A090315 Zeros are unproved. I have checked for a(21) up to 10^13, a(46) up to 10^14, a(33) up to 10^18, a(39) up to 10^20, a(35) up to 10^30 and the rest (7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41 and 43) up to at least 10^48. - _David Wasserman_, Nov 01 2005
