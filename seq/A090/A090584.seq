%N A090584 Smallest number m such that n followed by m threes yields a prime or -1 if no solution exists or has been found for n.
%C A090584 a(n) = 0 if n is already prime. a(n) = -1 for n = any multiple of 3 other than 3 itself. The first 5 record holders in this sequence are 1, 14, 20, 25, 40 with the values 1, 2, 3, 8, 483 respectively. 410 may be the next record holder as no solution has been found for it yet. 410 was tested out to 1250 threes with no prime formed.
%C A090584 From _Toshitaka Suzuki_, May 19 2024: (Start)
%C A090584 The first 6 record holders in this sequence are 1, 14, 20, 25, 40, 410 with the values 1, 2, 3, 8, 483, 37398 respectively. 817 may be the next record holder as no solution has been found for it yet. 817 was tested out to 300000 threes with no prime formed.
%C A090584 a(n) = -1 when n = 37037*k + 2808, 3666, 4070, 9287, 18799, 21574, 28083, 30558, 33300, 33740, 36663 or 36707, because n followed by any positive number, m say, of 3's is divisible by at least one of the primes {7,11,13,37}. (End)

%e A090584 a(25) = 8 because eight 3's must be appended to 25 before a prime is formed (2533333333).
%e A090584 a(6) = -1 because no matter how many 3's are appended to 6, the resulting number is always divisible by 3 and can therefore not be prime.
