%N A090584 Smallest number m such that n followed by m threes yields a prime or -1 if no solution exists or has been found for n.
%C A090584 a(n) = 0 if n is already prime. a(n) = -1 for n = any multiple of 3 other than 3 itself. The first 5 record holders in this sequence are 1, 14, 20, 25, 40 with the values 1, 2, 3, 8, 483 respectively. 410 may be the next record holder as no solution has been found for it yet. 410 was tested out to 1250 threes with no prime formed.
%e A090584 a(25)=8 because eight 3's must be appended to 25 before a prime is formed (2533333333). a(6) = -1 because no matter how many 3's are appended to 6, the resulting number is always divisible by 3 and can therefore not be prime.
%Y A090584 Cf. A083747 (The Wilde Primes, i.e. same operation using ones), A090464 (using sevens), A090465 (using nines).
