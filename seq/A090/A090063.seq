%N A090063 Numbers n such that there are (presumably) two palindromes in the Reverse and Add! trajectory of n.
%C A090063 For terms < 2000 each palindrome is reached from the preceding one or from the start in at most 24 steps; after the presumably last one no further palindrome is reached in 2000 steps.

%e A090063 The trajectory of 118 begins 118, 929, 1858, 10439, 103840, 152141, 293392, 586784, 1074469, ...; at 1074469 it joins the (presumably) palindrome-free trajectory of A063048(72) = 90379, hence 929 and 293392 are the two palindromes in the trajectory of 118 and 118 is a term.
%Y A090063 Cf. A023108, A023109, A065001, A070742, A077594.
