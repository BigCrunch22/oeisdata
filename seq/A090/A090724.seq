%C A090724 1. Start with the sequence of final digits of primes (A007652), beginning at 7 so that all members of this sequence will be either 1,3,7, or 9: {7,1,3,7,9,3,9,1,7,1,3,7,3,9,1,7,1,3,...}.
%C A090724 2. Replace all 3's with 6's, all 1's with 3's, all 7's with 5's and all 9's with 4's: {5,3,6,5,4,6,4,3,5,3,6,5,6,4,3,5,3,6, ...}.
%C A090724 3. Subtract (n mod 4) from the n-th member of this sequence (i.e. subtract 1 from the first, 5th, 9th, 13th, ... members, subtract 2 from the 2nd, 6th, 10th, ... members and subtract 3 from the 3rd, 7th, 11th,... members) to get the final sequence: {4,1,3,5,3,4,1,3,4,1,3,5,5,2,0,5,2,4, ...}.
%C A090724 The {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} symbols coded onto the modulo 4 cycle {1,2,3,4} by the prime digits set {1,3,7,9}.
