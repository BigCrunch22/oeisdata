%N A090069 Numbers n such that there are (presumably) eight palindromes in the Reverse and Add! trajectory of n.
%C A090069 For terms <= 5000 each palindrome is reached from the preceding one or from the start in at most 15 steps; after the presumably last one no further palindrome is reached in 2000 steps.

%e A090069 The trajectory of 8 begins 8, 16, 77, 154, 605, 1111, 2222, 4444, 8888, 17776, 85547, 160105, 661166, 1322332, 3654563, 7309126, ...; at 7309126 it joins the (presumably) palindrome-free trajectory of A063048(7) = 10577, hence 8, 77, 1111, 2222, 4444, 8888, 661166 and 3654563 are the eight palindromes in the trajectory of 8 and 8 is a term.
