%N A090066 Numbers n such that there are (presumably) five palindromes in the Reverse and Add! trajectory of n.
%C A090066 For terms < 2000 each palindrome is reached from the preceding one or from the start in at most 24 steps; after the presumably last one no further palindrome is reached in 2000 steps.

%e A090066 The trajectory of 106 begins 106, 707, 1414, 5555, 11110, 12221, 24442, 48884, 97768, ...; at 97768 it joins the (presumably) palindrome-free trajectory of A063048(3) = 1997, hence 707, 5555, 12221, 24442 and 48884 are the five palindromes in the trajectory of 106 and 106 is a term.
%Y A090066 Cf. A023108, A023109, A065001, A070742, A077594.
