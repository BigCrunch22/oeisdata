%N A090068 Numbers n such that there are (presumably) seven palindromes in the Reverse and Add! trajectory of n.
%C A090068 For terms < 2000 each palindrome is reached from the preceding one or from the start in at most 24 steps; after the presumably last one no further palindrome is reached in 2000 steps.

%e A090068 The trajectory of 25 begins 25, 77, 154, 605, 1111, 2222, 4444, 8888, 17776, 85547, 160105, 661166, 1322332, 3654563,7309126, ...; at 7309126 it joins the (presumably) palindrome-free trajectory of A063048(7) = 10577, hence 77, 1111, 2222, 4444, 8888, 661166 and 3654563 are the seven palindromes in the trajectory of 25 and 25 is a term.
