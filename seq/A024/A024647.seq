%N A024647 n written in fractional base 8/5.
%F A024647 To represent a number in base 8, if a digit exceeds 7, subtract 8 and carry 1. In the fractional base 8/5, subtract 8 and carry 5.
%e A024647 The integers 0 through 7 are written with the digits 0 through 7.
%e A024647 Then, since b = 8/5 is written as 10, and 8 is five times 8/5, 8 is 50 in base 8/5, and therefore a(8) = 50.
%e A024647 a(16) = 520, since 5 * (8/5)^2 + 2 * (8/5) = 5 * 64/25 + 2 * 8/5 = 64/5 + 16/5 = 80/5 = 16.
