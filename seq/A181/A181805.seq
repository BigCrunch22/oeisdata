%N A181805 Number of divisors of A181804(n) that are highly composite (A002182).
%C A181805 a(n) = maximal number of members of A002182 that have a least common multiple of A181804(n). Also, a(n) = length of row A181804(n) in triangles A181802 and A181803.
%C A181805 4, 13 and 16 are the first three positive integers that appear nowhere in this sequence (and, therefore, nowhere in A181801).  It would be interesting to know whether there are others.

%F A181805 a(n) = A181801(A181804(n)).
%e A181805 A181804(10) = 72 has exactly seven divisors that are members of A002182 (namely, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24 and 36). Hence, a(10) = 7.
%Y A181805 A181806(m) is the m-th member of A181804 such that the value of a(n) increases to a record. See also A181807.
