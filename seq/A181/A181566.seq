%N A181566 Expected number of elements needed to identify an abelian group of order n by testing the order of random elements.
%e A181566 For n=4, by the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, the group is either Z4 or Z2 x Z2. When you choose 2 elements, if you choose 1 element out of the 2 elements of order 4, you will know you have Z4. If you choose 2 elements of order 2 in Z2 x Z2, you will know you have Z2 x Z2. Calculating the probabilities, when you choose 2 elements, if the group is Z4, there is a 5/6 chance of knowing it. If it is Z2 x Z2, there is a 1/2 chance of knowing it. Since we assume each nonisomorphic abelian group has the same probability of being the group, averaging 5/6 and 1/2 we get a 2/3 chance that the group is known after choosing 2 elements. This is the first time we are at least 50% sure we will know what group it is, so this is the expected value of elements we will have to choose.
