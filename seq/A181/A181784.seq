%N A181784 Numerators of a series sum related to a game of chance.
%C A181784 Consider a 1-dimensional random walk from 0 with equal-probability steps of Pi and -1.  One way to compute the probability of eventually walking below 0 is as the sum over n of the probabilities of becoming negative after a walk with exactly n steps of Pi (n >= 0) and max(ceiling(n*Pi),1) steps of -1.  The total number of walks of such length for a given n is 2^(n+max(ceiling(n*Pi),1)), or 2^(n+A004084(n)) (n >= 1), forming a sequence of denominators, and this sequence gives the numerators, the number of possible sequences of length (n+max(ceiling(n*Pi),1)) drawn from {Pi, -1} such that no partial sum except the total sum is < 0.
%C A181784 See the Munafo web page for complete description.
%C A181784 a(n) diverges from A002293 because Pi is not exactly 3.
