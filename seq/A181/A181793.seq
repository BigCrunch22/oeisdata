%N A181793 Primitive members of A181792.
%C A181793 A member of A181792 is called primitive iff it is not a multiple of any smaller member of A181792.  Every member of A181792 is a multiple of at least one member of this sequence.
%C A181793 Equivalently, positive integers of the form p*q^2, where p is a prime congruent to 1 mod 3 and q is a prime congruent to 2 mod 6.
%e A181793 Of 28's 6 divisors, 4 (1, 4, 7, and 28) are congruent to 1 mod 3; 2 (2 and 14) are congruent to 2 mod 3; and 0 are congruent to 0 mod 3.  Note that 4, 2, and 0 are congruent to 1 mod 3, 2 mod 3, and 0 mod 3 respectively. 28 therefore belongs to A181792.  Since no smaller divisor of 28 belongs to A181792, 28 also belongs to this sequence.
