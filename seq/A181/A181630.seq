%N A181630 Duplicate of A112310.
%C A181630 A181631 = number of leading 1's in Fibonacci Maximal notation.
%C A181630 This notation uses headings: (...5, 3, 2, 1); and fills in entries starting from the right, as opposed to the left. For example n=8 = 1011 = (5 + 2 + 1) as opposed to Minimal notation which would be (1100) = (5 + 3).
%C A181630 Conjectured row sums = A023610: (1, 3, 7, 15, 30, 58, ...).
%C A181630 Is this the same as A112310? - _R. J. Mathar_, Nov 03 2010

%C A181630 The next row of 13 terms = (3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 4, 4, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6), sum = 58. (End)
%F A181630 Count numbers of 1's in Fibonacci Maximal notation for n.
