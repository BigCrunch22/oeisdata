%N A181621 Table by rows, the number E(n;2) of binary-alphabet topological epsilon-machines as a function of the number of states n and edges k.
%C A181621 From Table 1, p. 6 of Johnson. Abstract: We show how to efficiently enumerate a class of finite-memory stochastic processes using the causal representation of epsilon-machines. We characterize epsilon-machines in the language of automata theory and adapt a recent algorithm for generating accessible deterministic finite automata, pruning this over-large class down to that of epsilon-machines. As an application, we exactly enumerate topological epsilon-machines up to seven states and six-letter alphabets.
