%N A181521 Representation of n = sum_k b_k*(k!!) in the double-factorial base by some b_k-fold concatenation of the indices k.
%C A181521 The encoding of n is similar to A111095 but uses a double-factorial base A006882 to define the expansion coefficients.
%C A181521 The expansion coefficients b_k in n = sum_{k>=1} b_k * A006882(k) are defined "greedily" by taking the largest A006882(k) which is <=n, choosing b_k as large as possible such that b_k*A006882(k) remains <=n, subtracing b_k*A006882(k) from n to define a remainder, and recursively slicing the remainder to generate b_{k-1}, then b_{k-2} etc until the remainder reduces to zero. This produces the b_k for each n equivalent to A019513(n).
%C A181521 This representation A019513 is then scanned from the least to the most-significant b_k, i.e., along increasing k, and for each nonzero b_k, b_k copies of k are appended to a string representation -- starting from an empty string. This final representation is interpreted as a base-10 number a(n).
