%N A181506 TNP(n,k) triangle read by rows. TNP(n,k) is the number of triangular-number partitions of n with k parts.
%C A181506 The nonzero triangular numbers are of the form binomial(n, 2) for n = 2, 3, 4, ... namely: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, ....
%C A181506 A triangular-number partition of n is a partition of n all of whose parts are triangular numbers. For example, (7 =) 1+6 = 1+3+3 = 1+1+1+1+3 are three different triangular-number partitions of 7; the first has 2 parts, the second has 3 parts, and the third has 5 parts.
%C A181506 TNP(n, k) is the number of triangular-number partitions of n with k parts.
%C A181506 This sequence is the TNP(n, k) triangle read by rows.

%e A181506 For example, row 12 is 0 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1.
%e A181506 We have TNP(12, 1) = 0 because 12 is not a triangular number.
%e A181506 We have TNP(12, 2) = 1 because 6+6 is the unique triangular-number partition of 12 with 2 parts.
%e A181506 And we have TNP(12, 3) = 2 because 3+3+6 and 1+1+10 are the 2 triangular-number partitions of 12 with 3 parts.
