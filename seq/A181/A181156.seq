%N A181156 Odd Fibonacci numbers F which have a proper Fibonacci divisor G such that F/G is a Lucas number or a product of Lucas numbers.
%C A181156 A conjectural statement that, for odd prime p, the ratio F_{p^2}/F_{p} is never a Lucas number or a product of some Lucas numbers, yields that
%C A181156 a) an odd Fibonacci number F is in the sequence iff for its maximal proper Fibonacci divisor G, we have: ind G does not equal sqrt(ind F) and F/G does not have a proper Fibonacci divisor > 3;
%C A181156 b) an odd Fibonacci number F is in the sequence iff its index has one of the forms: 6k+2 or 6k+4 (see A047235).
%e A181156 F = 3 has the proper Fibonacci divisor G=1, and F/G = 3 is a Lucas number.
%e A181156 F = 317811 has the proper Fibonacci divisors 3, 13, and 377, and F/377 = 843 is a Lucas number.
