%N A181311 Highly abundant numbers k whose largest prime factor is less than log(k).
%C A181311 Every highly abundant number (A002093) is either in this sequence or A181312. Although it appears that for every n there is at least one prime p such that n*p is another highly abundant number, this conjecture fails for 46846800, the 227th term.
