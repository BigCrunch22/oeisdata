%N A181347 Numerators of lower triangular matrix T:=log(F), with the matrix F:=A037027 (Fibonacci convolution matrix).
%C A181347 The denominator triangle is given by A181348.
%C A181347 Because exp(T) = F, T may be considered as generator of F.
%C A181347 This should be read as N x N matrix for N>=2: log(F_N) := -sum(((-1)^k)/k)*(F_N - Id_N)^k,N-1) with the lower triangular N x N matrix F_N := Matrix([seq([seq(A037027(n,m),n=0..N-1)],m=0..N-1)]) and the N x N identity matrix Id_N.
%C A181347 The log series terminates because of the lower triangular property, and the fact that all main diagonal elements are 1, which follows from
%C A181347 F = Riordan matrix (Fib(x),x*Fib(x)) with the o.g.f. Fib(x)=1/(1-x-x^2). For this notation of Riordan arrays see, e.g., the W.Lang link given in A006232, and there the paragraph "Summary on A- and Z-sequences for Riordan matrices", as well as the 1991 Shapiro et al. reference on the Riordan group given in A053121.
