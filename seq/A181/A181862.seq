%N A181862 Decimal sturdy numbers: positive integers m such that sum of digits of k * m for any positive integer k is at least the sum of digits of m.
%C A181862 Positive integers m such that A007953(m) = A077196(m).
%C A181862 All powers of 10 and many multiples of 3 are in this sequence, many prime numbers are not. Notable exceptions are the primes 11 and 41 that are in this sequence, and multiples of 3 like 6 and 15 that are not.
%C A181862 This suggests that a digit sum of 6 disqualifies a multiple of 3 from this sequence, not parity. A digit sum of 9, by contrast, ensures the number is in this sequence. - _Alonso del Arte_, Oct 02 2016

%e A181862 11 has a digit sum of 2. If a multiple of 11 exists with a digit sum of 1, that would mean a power of 10 is also a multiple of 11, which is absurd. Therefore 11 is in the sequence.
%e A181862 12 = 2^2 * 3 has a digit sum of 3. In base 10, all multiples of 3 have a digital root of 3, 6 or 9, which means that a total digit sum of 1 or 2 is impossible for a multiple of 3. Therefore 12 is in the sequence.
%e A181862 13 has a digit sum of 4. However, note that 7 * 11 * 13 = 1001, which has a digit sum of 2. So 13 is not in the sequence.
