%N A181806 Positive integers with more highly composite divisors (A002182) than any smaller positive integer.
%C A181806 Numbers n such that A181801(n) > A181801(m) for all m < n. Also, numbers n such that row n of triangles A181802 and A181803 is longer than any previous row in either triangle.
%C A181806 Not a subsequence of A002182. The smallest positive integer which has a record number of highly composite divisors, but which is not highly composite itself, is 30240.

%e A181806 12 has five divisors (namely, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 12) that are members of A002182. No positive integer smaller than 12 has more than three members of A002182 among its divisors; hence, 12 is a member of the sequence.
%Y A181806 A181807(n) = number of highly composite divisors of a(n) (i.e., A181801(a(n))).
%Y A181806 Subsequence of A025487, A181804. Numbers A181804(n) such that A181805(n) increases to a record.
%Y A181806 Includes all members of A136253.
