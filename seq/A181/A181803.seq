%N A181803 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the k-th smallest divisor d of n such that n sets a record for the number of its divisors that are multiples of d.
%C A181803 In other words, row n contains a particular divisor d of n iff more multiples of d appear among the divisors of n than appear among the divisors of any smaller positive integer. Cf. A181808.
%C A181803 Row n contains A181801(n) numbers, the largest of which is n. T(n,k) * A180802(n, A181801(n)-k+1) = n.
%C A181803 For all positive integer values (j,k) such that jk = n, the number of divisors of n that are multiples of j equals A000005(k). Therefore, j appears in row n iff k=n/j is a member of A002182.

%F A181803 T(n,k) = n/(A180802(n, A181801(n)-k+1)).
%e A181803 First rows read: 1; 1,2; 3; 1,2,4; 5; 1,3,6; 7; 2,4,8; 9; 5,10; 11; 1,2,3,6,12;...
%e A181803 6 has four divisors (1, 2, 3 and 6). Of those divisors, 1, 3 and 6 appear in row 6.
%e A181803 a. The divisors of 6 include four multiples of 1 (1, 2, 3 and 6); two multiples of 3 (3 and 6), and one multiple of 6 (6). No positive integer smaller than 6 has more than three multiples of 1 among its divisors; hence, 1 appears in row 6. Also, no positive integer smaller than 6 has more than one multiple of 3 among its divisors, or has any multiple of 6 among its divisors. Hence, 3 and 6 both appear in row 6.
%e A181803 b. On the other hand, although 6 includes two multiples of 2 among its divisors (2 and 6), so does a smaller positive integer (4, whose even divisors are 2 and 4). Accordingly, 2 is not included in row 6.
%e A181803 The divisors of 6 that appear in row 6 are therefore 1, 3 and 6. Note that 1, 3 and 6 equal 6/6, 6/2 and 6/1 respectively, and all of the denominators in those fractions are highly composite numbers (A002182).
