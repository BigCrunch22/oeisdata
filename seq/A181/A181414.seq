%N A181414 Products of exactly two Pillai primes.
%C A181414 It would not be right to call these "Pillai semiprimes" as that would better describe semiprimes k such that there exists an integer m such that m!+1 is 0 mod k and k is not 1 mod m.
%C A181414 There are no pairs (n, n+1) in this sequence since all terms are odd.  The first few n such that n and n+2 are in the sequence are 11771, 14099, 19337, 32729, 32741, 34829, 37391, 38249, 39467, 40319, 41747, ... - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jan 28 2011
