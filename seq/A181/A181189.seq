%N A181189 Maximal number of elements needed to identify an abelian group of order n by testing the order of random elements.

%F A181189 For all squarefree n, a(n)=0, since there is only one abelian group of order n. Hence the group is trivially known without any checking.
%e A181189 For n=20, by the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, the group is either Z20 or Z10 x Z2. At worst, you could choose the identity, 1 element of order 2, 4 elements of order 5, and 4 elements of order 10. Then you still wouldn't know which group you have. But the order of the next element you choose will determine the group you have. So a(20)=11.
%e A181189 The previous value was a(16) = 9; It should be 13. Two of the size-16 groups have shapes [4,2,2] and [4,4], with element-orders:quantities
%e A181189         [4,2,2] 1:1 2:7 4:8
%e A181189         [4,4]   1:1 2:3 4:12
%e A181189     The sample 1:1, 2:3, 4:8 (12 in total) won't distinguish those two. - _Don Reble_, Oct 04 2023
