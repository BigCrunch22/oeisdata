%N A181189 Maximal number of elements needed to identify an abelian group of order n by testing the order of random elements.
%F A181189 For all squarefree n, a(n)=0, since there is only one abelian group of order n. Hence the group is trivially known without any checking.
%e A181189 For n=20, by the fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups, the group is either Z20 or Z10 x Z2. At worst, you could choose the identity, 1 element of order 2, 4 elements of order 5, and 4 elements of order 10. Then you still wouldn't know which group you have. But the order of the next element you choose will determine the group you have. So a(20)=11.
%Y A181189 Cf. A005117.
