%N A181135 a(n) = ADP(n) is the total number of aperiodic k-double-palindromes of n, where 2 <= k <= n.
%C A181135 A k-composition of n is an ordered collection of k positive integers (parts) which sum to n. A k-composition is aperiodic (primitive) if its period is k, i.e., if it is not the concatenation of at least two smaller compositions. A palindrome is a word which is the same when written backwards.
%C A181135 A k-double-palindrome of n is a k-composition of n which is the concatenation of two palindromes, PP'=P|P', where both |P|, |P'|>=1. For example 1123532=11|23532 is a 7-double-palindrome of 17 since both 11 and 23532 are palindromes. It is also aperiodic, so it is an aperiodic 7-double-palindrome of 17. See sequence A181111.
%C A181135 The n-th term of this sequence is ADP(n), the total number of aperiodic k-double-palindromes of n, where 2 <= k <= n.
%C A181135 For example ADP(6)=16 because there are 16 aperiodic k-double-palindromes of 6 for k=2,3,4,5, or 6. They are:
%C A181135 (with k=2) 15=1|5, 51=5|1, 24=2|4, 42=4|2,
%C A181135 (with k=3) 114=11|4, 411=4|11,
%C A181135 (with k=4) 1113=111|3, 3111=3|111, 1311=131|1, 1131=1|131, 1122=11|22, and 2211=22|11,
%C A181135 (with k=5) 11112=1111|2, 21111=2|1111, 12111=121|11, 11121=11|121.
