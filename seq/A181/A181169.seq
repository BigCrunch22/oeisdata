%N A181169 'ADPE(n,k)' triangle read by rows. ADPE(n,k) is the number of aperiodic k-double-palindromes of n up to cyclic equivalence.
%C A181169 A k-composition of n is an ordered collection of k positive integers (parts) which sum to n. A k-composition is aperiodic (primitive) if its period is k, i.e., if it is not the concatenation of at least two smaller compositions. A palindrome is a word which is the same when written backwards.
%C A181169 A k-double-palindrome of n is a k-composition of n which is the concatenation of two palindromes, PP'=P|P', where both |P|, |P'|>=1.
%C A181169 For example 1123532=11|23532 is a 7-double-palindrome of 17 since both 11 and 23532 are palindromes. It is also aperiodic, and so it is an aperiodic 7-double-palindrome of 17. See sequence A181111.
%C A181169 Two k-compositions of n are cyclically equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by a cyclic permutation of its parts.
%C A181169 Let ADPE(n,k) denote the number of aperiodic k-double-palindromes of n up to cyclic equivalence, i.e., the number of cyclic equivalence classes containing at least one aperiodic k-double-palindrome.
%C A181169 This sequence is the `ADPE(n,k)' triangle read by rows.

%e A181169 For example, row 8 is: 0 3 3 4 3 3 1 0.
%e A181169 We have ADPE(8,3)=3 because the 6 aperiodic 3-double-palindromes of 8: 116, 611, 224, 422, 233, and 332 come in 3 cyclic equivalence classes: {116, 611, 161}, {224, 422, 242}, and {233, 323, 332}.
%e A181169 We have ADPE(8,4)=4 because there are 4 4-double-palindromes of 8 up to cyclic equivalence, the 4 classes are: {1115, 5111, 1511, 1151}, {1214, 4121, 1412, 2141}, {1133, 3113, 3311, 1331}, and {1232, 2123, 3212, 2321}.

%Y A181169 Row sums are A181314.
%Y A181169 If we remove the aperiodic requirement we get sequence A180918.
%Y A181169 If we count the aperiodic k-double-palindromes of n (not the number of classes) we get sequence A181111 which is the 'ADP(n, k)' triangle read by rows, where ADP(n, k) is the number of aperiodic k-double-palindromes of n.
