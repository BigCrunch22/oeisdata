%N A181047 Number of length-n sequences A over {1,2,3} with the property that all of r(A), r(r(A)), etc. are over {1,2,3}, where r is the sequence obtained by taking the run lengths in A.
%e A181047 For example, the run-lengths in 1333 are 13, then the run-lengths of this is 11, then the run-lengths of this is 2, then the run-lengths of this is 1, so this sequence is counted in a(4).
