%N A181785 Wechsler's "convex-hull polyominoes": convex hull contains no additional grid points.
%C A181785 Given a polyomino P on a square lattice, if you replace each of the squares in P with a point (say the "upper-left" corner) and call that set of points S, then define H to be the convex hull of S: the polyomino is said to be a "convex-hull polyomino" if all lattice points in H are also in S.

%e A181785 For N=5 there are 12 polyominoes, but only 10 qualify. The two that do not are the "U" and "V" pentominoes, pictured here:

%e A181785 Both are "concave" in the sense that a convex hull of the 5 points in the pentomino also includes one grid point that is not in the pentomino.
