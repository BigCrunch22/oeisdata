%N A181524 Table read by rows in which n-th row gives the smallest solution (a,b,c,d) to the partition (4n+1)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 with 0 < a < b < c < d.
%C A181524 Solutions to the Diophantine partition of (4n+1)^2 into 4 distinct nonzero squares are counted in A175958.
%C A181524 The table contains four numbers a,b,c,d in row n illustrating one particular solution, minimizing a, if there are two solutions with the same a minimizing b etc.
%e A181524 The table starts in row n=2 as
%e A181524   2,  4,  5,  6; # 2^2 + 4^2 +  5^2 +  6^2 = (4*2+1)^2
%e A181524   1,  2,  8, 10; # 1^2 + 2^2 +  8^2 + 10^2 = (4*3+1)^2
%e A181524   2,  4, 10, 13; # 2^2 + 4^2 + 10^2 + 13^2 = (4*4+1)^2
