%N A181500 Triangle read by rows: number of solutions of n queens problem for given n and given number of queens engaged in conflicts.
%C A181500 Schlude and Specker investigate if it is possible to set n-1 non-attacking queens on an n X n toroidal chessboard. That is equivalent to searching for normal (i.e., non-toroidal) solutions of 3 engaged queens. In this case, one of the three queens has conflicts with both other queens. If you remove this queen, you get a setting of n-1 queens without conflicts, i.e., a toroidal solution.

%e A181500 For n=4, there are only the two solutions 2-4-1-3 and 3-1-4-2. For both solutions, all 4 queens are engaged in conflicts. So the terms for n=4 are 0 (0 solutions for n=4 having 0 engaged queens), 0, 0, 0 and 2 (the two cited above). These are members 11 to 15 of the sequence.
