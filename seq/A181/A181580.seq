%N A181580 Smallest prime p such that p! ends with exactly n trailing 0's (or 0, if no such p exists).
%e A181580 For any positive integer n, n! must have at least as many trailing 0's as does (n-1)!; thus, other than the terms where a(n)=0, the sequence is strictly increasing.
%e A181580 2 is the first prime whose factorial (2! = 2) has no trailing 0's, so a(0)=2.
%e A181580 5 is the first prime whose factorial (5! = 120) has one trailing 0, so a(1)=5.
%e A181580 There is no number whose factorial has exactly 5 trailing 0's (since the factorials of 24 and 25 have 4 and 6 trailing 0's, respectively), so a(5)=0.
