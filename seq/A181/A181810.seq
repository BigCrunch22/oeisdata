%N A181810 a(n) = largest number k such that A002182(n)/j is highly composite for each integer j from 1 to k.
%C A181810 Also, largest number k such that, for each integer j from 1 to k, more multiples of j appear among the divisors of A002182(n) than appear among the divisors of any smaller positive integer.
%C A181810 For all positive integer values (j,k) such that jk = n, the number of divisors of n that are multiples of j equals A000005(k). Therefore, n sets a record for the number of its divisors that are multiples of j iff k = n/j is highly composite (A002182).

%e A181810 360 is a member of A002182, twice a member of A002182 (360/2 = 180), and three times a member of A002182 (360/3 = 120), but is not four times a member of A002182 (360/4 = 90 is not a member of A002182). Since A002182(13) = 360, a(13) = 3.
%e A181810 360 also sets records for the number of its divisors, the number of its divisors that are multiples of 2 (cf. A181808), and the number of its divisors that are multiples of 3, but not the number of its divisors that are multiples of 4.
