%N A237348 Number of ordered ways to write n = k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that prime(k) + 4 and prime(prime(m)) + 4 are both prime.
%C A237348 Conjecture: For each d = 1, 2, 3, ... there is a positive integer N(d) for which any integer n > N(d) can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that prime(k) + 2*d and prime(prime(m)) + 2*d are both prime. In particular, we may take (N(1), N(2), ..., N(10)) = (2, 11, 4, 15, 31, 4, 2, 77, 4, 7).
%C A237348 This extension of the "Super Twin Prime Conjecture" (posed by the author) implies de Polignac's well-known conjecture that any positive even number can be a difference of two primes infinitely often.

%e A237348 a(7) = 1 since 7 = 6 + 1 with prime(6) + 4 = 13 + 4 = 17 and prime(prime(1)) + 4 = prime(2) + 4 = 7 both prime.
%e A237348 a(114) = 1 since 114 = 78 + 36 with prime(78) + 4 = 397 + 4 = 401 and prime(prime(36)) + 4 = prime(151) + 4 = 877 + 4 = 881 both prime.
