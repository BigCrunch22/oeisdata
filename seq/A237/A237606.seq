%C A237606 From _Klaus Purath_, Feb 17 2024: (Start)
%C A237606 Positive numbers of the form 15x^2 - y^2. The reduced form is -x^2 + 6xy + 6y^2.
%C A237606 Even powers of terms as well as products of an even number of terms belong to A243188. This can be proved with respect to the forms [a,0,-c] and [a, 0, +c] by the following identities: (au^2 - cv^2)(ax^2 - cy^2) = (aux + cvy)^2 - ac(uy + vx)^2 and (au^2 + cv^2)(ax^2 + cy^2) = (aux - cvy)^2 + ac(uy + vx)^2 for all a, c, u, v, x, y in R. This can be verified by expanding both sides of the equations. Generalization (conjecture): This multiplication rule applies to all sequences represented by any binary quadratic form [a, b, c].
%C A237606 Odd powers of terms as well as products of an odd number of terms belong to the sequence. This can be proved with respect to the forms [a,0,-c] and [a, 0, +c] by the following identities: (as^2 - ct^2)(au^2 - cv^2)(ax^2 - cy^2) = a[s(aux + cvy) + ct(uy + vx)]^2 - c[as(uy + vx) + t(aux + cvy)]^2 and (as^2 + ct^2)(au^2 + cv^2)(ax^2 + cy^2) = a[s(aux - cvy) - ct(uy + vx)]^2 + c[as(uy + vx) + t(aux - cvy)]^2 for all a, c, s, t, u, v, x, y in R. This can be verified by expanding both sides of the equations. Generalization (conjecture): This multiplication rule applies to all sequences represented by any binary quadratic form [a, b, c].
%C A237606 If we denote any term of this sequence by B and correspondingly of A243189 by C and of A243190 by D, then B*C = D, C*D = B and B*D = C. This can be proved by the following identities, where the sequence (B) is represented by [kn, 0, -1], (C) by [n, 0, -k] and (D) by [k, 0, -n].
%C A237606 Proof of B*C = D: (knu^2 - v^2)(nx^2 - ky^2) =  k(nux + vy)^2 - n(kuy + vx)^2 for k, n, u, v, x, y in R.
%C A237606 Proof of C*D = B: (nu^2 - kv^2)(kx^2 - ny^2) = kn(ux + vy)^2 - (nuy + kvx)^2 for k, n, u, v, x, y in R.
%C A237606 Proof of B*D = C: (knu^2 - v^2)(kx^2 - ny^2) = n(kux + vy)^2 - k(nuy + vx)^2 for k, n, u, v, x, y in R. This can be verified by expanding both sides of the equations.
%C A237606 Generalization (conjecture): If there are three sequences of a given positive discriminant that are represented by the forms [a1, b1, c1], [a2, b2, c2] and [a1*a2, b3, c3] for a1, a2 != 1, then the BCD rules apply to these sequences. (End)
