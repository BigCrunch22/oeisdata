%N A237367 Number of ordered ways to write n = k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that 2*k - 1, prime(k)^2 - 2 and prime(m)^2 - 2 are all prime.
%C A237367 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 2, and a(n) = 1 only for n = 3, 73, 81, 534.
%C A237367 (ii) Any integer n > 2 can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that 2*k - 1, prime(k) + k*(k-1) and prime(m) + m*(m-1) are all prime.
%C A237367 (iii) Every n = 9, 10, ... can be written as k + m with k > 0 and m > 0 such that 6*k - 1, prime(k) + 2*k and prime(m) + 2*m are all prime.
%C A237367 Clearly, part (i) of this conjecture implies that there are infinitely many primes p with p^2 - 2 also prime. Similar comments apply to parts (ii) and (iii).

%e A237367 a(3) = 1 since 3 = 2 + 1 with 2*2 - 1 = 3, prime(2)^2 - 2 = 3^2 - 2 = 7 and prime(1)^2 - 2 = 2^2 - 2 = 2 all prime.
%e A237367 a(73) = 1 since 73 = 55 + 18 with 2*55 - 1 = 109, prime(55)^2 - 2 = 257^2 - 2 = 66047 and prime(18)^2 - 2 = 61^2 - 2 = 3719 all prime.
%e A237367 a(81) = 1 since 81 = 34 + 47 with 2*34 - 1 = 67, prime(34)^2 - 2 = 139^2 - 2 = 19319 and prime(47)^2 - 2 = 211^2 - 2 = 44519 all prime.
