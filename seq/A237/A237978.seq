%N A237978 Number of partitions of n having depth 3; see Comments.
%C A237978 Suppose that P is a partition of n. Let x(1), x(2),...,x(k) be the distinct parts of P, and let m(i) be the multiplicity of x(i) in P. Let f(P) be the partition [m(1)*x(1), m(2)*x(2),...,x(k)*m(k)] of n. Define c(0,P) = P, c(1,P) = f(P),..., c(n,P) = f(c(n-1,P), and define d(P) = least n such that c(n,P) has no repeated parts; d(P) is introduced here as the depth of P. Clearly d(P) = 0 if and only if P is a strict partition, as in A000009. Conjecture: if d >= 0, then 2^d is the least n that has a partition of depth d.
%e A237978 a(14) = 3 counts these partitions: 64211, 632111, 433211.
%e A237978 Successive applications of f to the first of these partitions are indicated by 64211 -> 6422 -> 644 -> 86.
