%N A237049 Number of ordered ways to write n = i + j + k (0 < i <= j <= k) with i,j,k not all equal such that sigma(i)*sigma(j)*sigma(k) is a cube, where sigma(m) denotes the sum of all positive divisors of m.
%C A237049 Conjecture: For every k = 2, 3, ... there is a positive integer N(k) such that any integer n > N(k) can be written as n_1 + n_2 + ... + n_k with n_1, n_2, ..., n_k positive and distinct such that the product sigma(n_1)*sigma(n_2)*...*sigma(n_k) is a k-th power. In particular, we may take N(2) = 309, N(3) = 42, N(4) = 25, N(5) = 24, N(6) = 27 and N(7) = 32.
%C A237049 This is similar to the conjecture in A233386.
