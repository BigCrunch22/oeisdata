%N A237123 Number of ways to write n = i + j + k with 0 < i < j < k such that phi(i), phi(j) and phi(k) are all cubes, where phi(.) is Euler's totient function.
%C A237123 Conjecture: For each k = 2, 3, ... there is a positive integer s(k) such that any integer n >= s(k) can be written as i_1 + i_2 + ... + i_k with 0 < i_1 < i_2 < ... < i_k such that all those phi(i_1), phi(i_2), ..., phi(i_k) are k-th powers. In particular, we may take s(2) = 70640, s(3) = 935 and s(4) = 3273.

%e A237123 a(18) = 1 since 18 = 1 + 2 + 15 with phi(1) = 1^3, phi(2) = 1^3 and phi(15) = 2^3.

%e A237123 a(1613) = 1 since 1613 = 192 + 333 + 1088 with phi(192) = 4^3, phi(333) = 6^3 and phi(1088) = 8^3.
