%N A237769 Number of primes p < n with pi(n-p) - 1 and pi(n-p) + 1 both prime, where pi(.) is given by A000720.
%C A237769 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 8, and a(n) = 1 only for n = 9, 34, 35.
%C A237769 (ii) For any integer n > 4, there is a prime p < n such that 3*pi(n-p) - 1, 3*pi(n-p) + 1 and 3*pi(n-p) + 5 are all prime. Also, for each integer n > 8, there is a prime p < n such that 3*pi(n-p) - 1, 3*pi(n-p) + 1 and 3*pi(n-p) - 5 are all prime.
%C A237769 (iii) For any integer n > 6, there is a prime p < n such that phi(n-p) - 1 and phi(n-p) + 1 are both prime, where phi(.) is Euler's totient function.

%e A237769 a(9) = 1 since 2, pi(9-2) - 1 = 3 and pi(9-2) + 1 = 5 are all prime.
%e A237769 a(34) = 1 since 19, pi(34-19) - 1 = pi(15) - 1 = 5 and pi(34-19) + 1 = pi(15) + 1 = 7 are all prime.
%e A237769 a(35) = 1 since 19, pi(35-19) - 1 = pi(16) - 1 = 5 and pi(35-19) + 1 = pi(16) + 1 = 7 are all prime.
