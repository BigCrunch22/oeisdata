%N A237577 Let x(1)x(2)...x(q) denote the decimal expansion of a number n > 9. a(n) is the number of iterations needed to reach the end of the cycle under the map n -> f(n) where f(n) is represented by the number y(1)y(2)...y(q) such that y(k) = (x(k) + x(k+1)) mod 10 for k = 1..q-1 and y(q) = (x(q) + x(1)) mod 10.
%C A237577 The smallest integers such that the number of iterations equals 1, 2, 3, ... are 19, 14, 22, 11, 10, 104, 106, 110, 119, 108, 112, 101, 100, 114, 121, 502, 1041, 1402, 10110, 10048, 10010, 10202, 10113, 10116, 10118, 10026, 11294, 10281, 10282, 10120, ...
