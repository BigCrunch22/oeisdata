%N A237708 Number of unit cubes, aligned with a three-dimensional Cartesian mesh, partially encircled along the edge of the first octant of a sphere centered at the origin, ordered by increasing radius.
%e A237708 At radius 0, there are no partially filled cubes.  At radius >0 but < sqrt(1), there is 1 partially filled square along the edge of the sphere.  At radius = sqrt(1), there is 1 partially filled cube along the edge of the sphere.  At radius > 1 but < sqrt(2), there  are 4 partially filled cubes.
%Y A237708 Cf. A000378 (corresponds to the square radius of alternate entries).
%Y A237708 Cf. A234300  (2-dimensional analog).
