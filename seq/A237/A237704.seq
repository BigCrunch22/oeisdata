%e A237704 Pell's equation x^2 - 2*y^2 = 1 and its fundamental solution is (x,y) = (3,2) which are both primes, so a(1) = 2.
%e A237704 (x,y) = (5,2) satisfies x^2 - 6*y^2 = 1, so a(2) = 6.
%e A237704 (x,y) = (7,2) satisfies x^2 - 12*y^2 = 1, so a(3) = 12.
%e A237704 Pell's equation x^2 - 2088*y^2 = 1 and (x,y) = (19603, 429), 19603 is prime, 429 = 3 * 11 * 13 is not, so 2088 is not included.
%e A237704 Pell's equation x^2 - 2000*y^2 = 1 and (x,y) = (930249, 20801), 930249 = 3^2 * 41 * 2521 and 20801 = 11 * 31 * 61 are not primes, so 2000 is not included.
