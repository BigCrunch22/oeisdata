%N A237705 Number of primes p < n with pi(n-p) prime, where pi(.) is given by A000720.
%C A237705 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 4, and a(n) = 1 only for n = 5, 12, 26, 27, 32, 68.
%C A237705 (ii) For any integer n > 5, there is a prime p <= n with pi(n+p) prime.
%C A237705 (iii) If n > 32, then pi((n-p)^2) is prime for some prime p < n. Also, for each n > 6 there is an odd prime p < 2*n with pi((n - (p-1)/2)^2) prime.
%C A237705 (iv) Any integer n > 11 can be written as p + q with p and pi(q^2 + q + 1) both prime.
%C A237705 (v) Each integer n > 34 can be written as k + m with k and m positive integers such that pi(k^2) and pi(2*m^2) are both prime.
