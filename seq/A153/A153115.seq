%N A153115 Positive integers with the same number of 1s in base 10 and base 2.
%C A153115 Some have exactly one 1. These are exclusively of the form 2^n, but not universally. 512 = 1000000000b, 1 one. 2048 = 100000000000b but 2048 lacks a 1 digit. The smallest integer with 6 ones in both decimal and binary bases is 11011112 = 101010000000010000101000b.
%C A153115 If n is in the sequence and  n == 0, 5, 9, 10, 13 or 17 (mod 20) or 11 (mod 40), then n+1 is in the sequence. - _Robert Israel_, Jun 17 2020

%e A153115 a(6)=1152 because 1152 base 2 = 10010000000 and both terms have the same number of ones.
