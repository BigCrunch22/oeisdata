%N A153207 Primes of the form 2*p-1 where p is prime and p-1 is squarefree.
%C A153207 Subsequence of A005383.
%e A153207 For p = 2 (the only case with p-1 odd), 2*p-1 = 3 is prime and p-1 = 1 is squarefree, so 3 is in the sequence. For p = 19, 2*p-1 = 37 is prime and p-1 = 18 is not squarefree, so 37 is not in the sequence.
