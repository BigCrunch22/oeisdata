%N A153663 Minimal exponents m such that the fractional part of (3/2)^m reaches a maximum (when starting with m=1).
%C A153663 Recursive definition: a(1)=1, a(n) = least number m such that the fractional part of (3/2)^m is greater than the
%C A153663 fractional part of (3/2)^k for all k, 1<=k<m.
%C A153663 The fractional part of k=835999 is .999999 5 which is greater than (k-1)/k. The fractional part of k=2242294 is .999999 8 which is greater than (k-1)/k. The fractional part of k=25380333 is .999999 98 which is greater than (k-1)/k. The fractional part of k=92600006 is .999999 998 which is greater than (k-1)/k. So, all additional numbers in this sequence must be in A153664 and >3*10^8. - _Robert Price_, May 09 2012
%F A153663 Recursion: a(1):=1, a(k):=min{ m>1 | fract((3/2)^m) > fract((3/2)^a(k-1))}, where fract(x) = x-floor(x).
%e A153663 a(2)=5, since fract((3/2)^5)=0.59375, but fract((3/2)^k)=0.5, 0.25, 0.375, 0.0625 for 1<=k<=4; thus
%e A153663 fract((3/2)^5)>fract((3/2)^k) for 1<=k<5.
