%N A153659 Triangle read by rows. A074206 interleaved with k-1 zeros in the k-th column.
%C A153659 By moving the term in the lower right corner to the upper right corner and then calculating the determinant one gets the sequence 1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,... The contributing permutation matrices have the same signs as the contributing permutation matrices in the MÃ¶bius function determinant. It is conjectured that their number is A074206.
