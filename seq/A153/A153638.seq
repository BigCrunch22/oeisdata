%N A153638 Odiousness of triangular numbers.
%C A153638 The odiousness of a number is equal to 1 if the number is odious, meaning that it has an odd number of ones in its binary expansion. Otherwise, it is zero.
%e A153638 a(2) is 0, because the second triangular number is 3, which in binary is 11 and has an even number of ones.
