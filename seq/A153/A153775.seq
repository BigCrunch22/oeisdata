%C A153775 From _Peter Munn_, Feb 10 2022: (Start)
%C A153775 Consider a Sierpinski arrowhead curve formed of edges indexed consecutively from 0 at its axis of symmetry and aligned with an infinite Sierpinski gasket so that each edge is contained in the boundary of either the plane sector occupied by the gasket or a triangular region of the gasket's complement. The numbers {4*a(n)-1 : n >= 1} (that is, 3, 7, 11, 19, 23, 31, 35, 55, 59, ...) index the edges that are contained in the boundaries of certain triangular regions: each is the first region encountered of each successively larger size that does not lie across the axis of symmetry.
%C A153775 Let S be the set of terms. Define c: N -> P(R) so that c(m) is the scaled and translated Cantor ternary set spanning [m-0.5, m], and let C be the union of c(m) for all m in S. C is the closure under multiplication by 3 of the scaled and translated Cantor ternary set spanning [0.5, 1.0].
