%N A153281 Triangle read by rows, A130321 * A127647. Also, number of subsets of [n+2] with consecutive integers that start at k.
%C A153281 Row sums = A008466(k-2): (1, 3, 8, 19, 43, 94, ...).
%C A153281 T(n,k) is the number of subsets of {1,...,n+2} that contain consecutive integers and that have k as the first integer in the first consecutive string. (See the example below.) Hence rows sums of T(n,k) give the number of subsets of {1,...,n+2} that contain consecutive integers. Also, T(n,k) = F(k)*2^(n+1-k), where F(k) is the k-th Fibonacci number, since there are F(k) subsets of {1,...,k-2} that contain no consecutive integers and there are 2^(n+1-k) subsets of {k+2,...,n+2}.

%F A153281 Triangle read by rows, A130321 * A127647. A130321 = an infinite lower triangular matrix with powers of 2: (A000079) in every column: (1, 2, 4, 8, ...).
%F A153281 A127647 = an infinite lower triangular matrix with the Fibonacci numbers, A000045 as the main diagonal and the rest zeros.
%F A153281 T(n,k)=2^(n+1-k)*F(k) where F(k) is the k-th Fibonacci number. [_Dennis Walsh_, Dec 21 2011]
