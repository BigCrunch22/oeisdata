%N A153494 a(n) is smallest number greater than n that, when compared divisors of a(n) with divisors of n, the d-th smallest divisor of a(n) is always <= the d-th smallest divisor of n for all values of d <= the number of divisors of n.
%e A153494 a(24) cannot be 36 because the 6th smallest divisor of 24 is 8 and the 6th smallest divisor of 36 is 9 > 8.
