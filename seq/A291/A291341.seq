%N A291341 Number of nonisomorphic graphs on n vertices that are first-player-winning in the game of Col.
%C A291341 The game of Col was studied by John Conway. It is played on a map. Here we slightly generalize the game so that players color the vertices of a graph.

%e A291341 For n=3, there are 4 nonisomorphic graphs on 3 vertices, containing 0, 1, 2, or 3 edges respectively. Among them, the graphs with 0 or 1 edge are first-player-winning. Hence, a(3)=2.
%t A291341 We need to download the database of nonisomorphic simple graphs from http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/graphs.html
