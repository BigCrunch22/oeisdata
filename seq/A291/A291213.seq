%N A291213 Start from the singleton set S = {n}, and unless 1 is already a member of S, generate on each iteration a new set where each odd number k is replaced by 3k+1, and each even number k is replaced by 3k+1 and k/2. a(n) is the total size of the set from the singleton through after the first iteration which has produced 1 as a member, inclusive.
%C A291213 See comments at A290100.
%C A291213 A290100(n) is the size of the set at the last iteration, while this sequence is the sum of sizes of all generations including the last iteration.
%C A291213 A290100(n)/A291213(n) < 29/90 for n = {6, 67, 81, 92, 102, 153, 155, 165, 198, 201, 202, 204, 205, 217, 228, 235, 264, 265, 289, 299, 308, 309, 349, 353, 360, 396, 408, 434, ...}, with n = 6 the greatest observed difference. - _Michael De Vlieger_, Aug 30 2017
