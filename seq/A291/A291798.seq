%N A291798 Take n-th word over {1,2} listed in A291797 and apply the Post tag system described in A284116 (but adapted to the alphabet {1,2}); a(n) = preperiod (or threshold) of orbit of that word.
%C A291798 Post's tag system maps a word w over {1,2} to w', where if w begins with 1, w' is obtained by appending 11 to w and deleting the first three letters, or if w begins with 2, w' is obtained by appending 2212 to w and deleting the first three letters.
%C A291798 We work over {1,2} rather than the official alphabet {0,1} because of the prohibition in the OEIS of terms (other than 0 itself) which begin with 0.
%C A291798 This is an analog of A284119 for the words in A291797.
