%N A291799 Take n-th word over {1,2} listed in A291797 and apply the Post tag system described in A284116 (but adapted to the alphabet {1,2}); a(n) = period of orbit of that word, or 0 if the orbit ends at the empty word.
%C A291799 Post's tag system maps a word w over {1,2} to w', where if w begins with 1, w' is obtained by appending 11 to w and deleting the first three letters, or if w begins with 2, w' is obtained by appending 2212 to w and deleting the first three letters.
%C A291799 We work over {1,2} rather than the official alphabet {0,1} because of the prohibition in the OEIS of terms (other than 0 itself) which begin with 0.
%C A291799 This is an analog of A291793 (or A284121) for the words in A291797.
