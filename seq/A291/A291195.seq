%N A291195 The number of total solar eclipses visible from Earth's surface during year n (TD).
%C A291195 The moment of the 'greatest eclipse,' defined as when the axis of the moon's shadow cone is closest to Earth's center, is used for determining this sequence.
%C A291195 Important Note: The dates and times in the data described below are in Terrestrial Dynamical Time (TD). Adjustment is required for Universal Time.
%C A291195 Hybrid eclipses, which are total on some parts of their paths and annular on other parts, are NOT counted here.
%C A291195 The 5000 sequence values in the b-file were derived from the NASA catalog (describing 11898 solar eclipses of all types, historical or predicted, during this time period, 2000 BCE to 3000 CE).
%C A291195 There are 3173 total solar eclipses and 569 hybrid solar eclipses during this 5000-year period.
%C A291195 All 5000 terms in the b-file are known (within reason). Although, for example, eclipse #528 in the Espenak & Meeus link is listed as happening at 23:51:46 on Dec 31 -1787, well within the computed uncertainty of 48 minutes for that date, no such instances occur with total eclipses. Indeed, all are within several standard errors. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Aug 10 2020
