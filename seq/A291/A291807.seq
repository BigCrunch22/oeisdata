%N A291807 The number of symmetric polyomino tilings of n X n square.
%C A291807 The sequence gives the number of distinct tilings by polyominoes of a square with side n, considering tilings that have at least one symmetry. As for "free" polyominoes, tilings that are reflections or rotations of each other are not considered distinct.
