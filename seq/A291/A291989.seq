%N A291989 Smallest number that exceeds n and is divisible by at least one prime factor of n and by at least one prime that does not divide n.
%C A291989 Numbers m in A096014 are even squarefree semiprimes, i.e., the product of A020639(n) and A053669(n). Numbers k in a(n) are always even composite, but not always squarefree or semiprime. For prime p, A096014(p) = a(p).
%C A291989 Let b(n) = A272619(n), continued for k > n that are products of at least one prime p that divides n and at least one prime q that is coprime to n. The index of a(n) in b(n) is A243823(n) + 1, i.e., a(n) is the term that would follow the terms of A272619(n), greater than n.

%F A291989 a(2) = 6; a(p) = A100484(pi(n)) for prime p > 2.
%F A291989 a(p) = A096014(p).
%e A291989 a(6) = A096014(6) = 10 since for 6, among the next composites {8, 9, 10, ...}, 10 is the first that is divisible by at least one prime p = 2 | 6, and at least one prime 5 that is coprime to 6. Since A020639(6) = 2 and A053669(6) = 5, a(6) and A096014(6) are identical.
%e A291989 a(12) = 14 since 14 is both the next composite after 12, and divisible by at least one prime divisor 2 of 12 and one prime q = 7 that is coprime to 12. This differs from A096014(12) = 10 because A053669(12) = 5, and 2 * 5 = 10.
