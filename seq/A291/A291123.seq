%N A291123 Number of ways to write 4*n+1 as (p-1)^2 + q^2 + r^2, where p is prime and q and r are nonnegative integers with q <= r.
%C A291123 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n, and a(n) = 1 only for n = 0, 3, 6, 23, 44.
%C A291123 (ii) Any positive integer relatively prime to 6 can be written as (p-1)^2 + q^2 + 3*r^2, where p is prime, and q and r are integers.
%C A291123 (iii) Let n be any nonnegative integer. Then 4*n+1 can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2, where x,y,z are nonnegative integers with x + y + 2*z prime; 4*n+2 can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2, where x,y,z are nonnegative integers with x + 3*y prime. Also, we can write 4*n+3 as 2*x^2 + y^2 + z^2, where x,y,z are nonnegative integers with 2*x+1 prime.
%C A291123 (iv) Let n be any nonnegative integer. Then we can write 4*n+1 as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 with x,y,z integers such that x^2 + 5*y^2 + 7*z^2 prime, and write 4*n+2 as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 with x,y,z integers such that x^2 + 2*y^2 + 5*z^2 prime. Also, we can write 8*n+3 as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 with x,y,z integers such that 2*x^2 + 4*y^2 + 5*z^2 is prime.
%C A291123 Note that by the Gauss-Legendre theorem any positive integer not of the form 4^k*(8*m+7) (k,m = 0,1,2,...) can be written as the sum of three squares.
