%N A291712 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive terms such that, for any m and n > 0, if m < n then a(m) != a(n) or a(m+1) != a(n+1), and if n = least k > m such that a(k) = a(m) then m and n have a different parity.
%C A291712 If we drop the constraint "if n = least k > m such that a(k) = a(m) then m and n have a different parity" then we obtain the natural numbers interspersed with 1's: 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 6, 1, 7, 1, ...
%C A291712 Conjecturally, (a(n), a(n+1)) uniquely runs over all pairs of positive integers (this is the motivation for this sequence).
%C A291712 This sequence has similarities with:
%C A291712 - A226005 whose pairs of consecutive terms run over all pairs of positive integers,
%C A291712 - A290633 whose pairs of consecutive terms (conjecturally) run over all pairs of noncoprime positive integers.
%C A291712 The representation of the first pairs of consecutive terms has nice features.
