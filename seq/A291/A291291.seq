%N A291291 Binary sequence defined by Baldini-Eschgfäller coupled dynamical system (f,lambda,alpha) with f = A291290, lambda(y) = 1-y for y in Y = {0,1}, and alpha(k) = k mod 2 for k in Omega = {0,1,2,3}.
%H A291291 Lucilla Baldini, Josef Eschgfäller, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01750">Random functions from coupled dynamical systems</a>, arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.01750 [math.CO], 2016. See Example 3.3.
%F A291291 Let f(k) = A291290(k) for k in N, lambda(y) = 1-y for y in Y = {0,1}, and alpha(k) = k mod 2 for k in Omega = {0,1,2,3}.
%F A291291 Then a(n) for n >= 0 is defined by a(n) = alpha(n) if n in Omega, and otherwise by a(n) = lambda(a(f(n))).
