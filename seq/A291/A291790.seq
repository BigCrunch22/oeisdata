%N A291790 Numbers whose trajectory under iteration of the map k -> (sigma(k)+phi(k))/2 consists only of integers and is unbounded.
%C A291790 It would be nice to have a proof that these trajectories are integral and unbounded, or, of course, that they eventually reach a fractional value (and die), or reach a prime (which is then a fixed point). (Cf. A291787.) If either of the last two things happen, then that value of n will be removed from the sequence. AT PRESENT ALL TERMS ARE CONJECTURAL.
%C A291790 When this sequence was submitted, there was a hope that it would be possible to prove that these trajectories were indeed integral and unbounded. This has not yet happened, although see the remarks of _Andrew R. Booker_ in A292108. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 25 2017
