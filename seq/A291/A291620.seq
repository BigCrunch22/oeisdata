%N A291620 Branch term s_n(b), b > 1 of equivalence classes of prime sequences {s_n(k)} for k > 0 derived by records of first differences of Rowland-like recurrences with increasing even start values >= 4.
%C A291620 See A291528 (leaves) for equivalence classes.
%C A291620 If the conjecture of an inverse tree of primes with the leaves in A291528 using the same index n holds, except a(1)=0 all terms a(n) == 0 indicates that the branch point is not yet found.
%C A291620 This is a k-ary tree, k > 2, such as a(7) == a(12) == 233.
%C A291620 Maybe these simple Rowland-like recurrences giving all primes are related to a simple bounded physical quantum system with a "Hamiltonian for the zeros of the Riemann zeta function" (cf. Bender et al.) having degenerated energy eigenvalues a(n).

%F A291620 a(n) > A291528(n) || a(n) == 0.
%e A291620 n=5: Some equivalence classes of prime sequences {s_n(k)} have the same tail for a constant C_n < k, such as {s_2(k)} = {7,13,29,59,131,...} and {s_5(k)} = {31,61,131,...} with common tail {a(5),...} = {131,...} and the branch 131 = a(5). Thus it seems that all terms != 0 are branches of a kind of an inverse prime-tree with the root at infinity.
