%N A291342 Number of labeled graphs on n vertices that are first-player-winning in the game of Col.
%C A291342 The game of Col was studied by John Conway. It is played on a map. Here we slightly generalize the game so that players color the vertices of a graph.

%e A291342 For n=3, there are 8 labeled graphs on 3 vertices: one has 0 edges, three have 1 edge, three have 2 edges, and one has 3 edges. Among them, the graphs with 0 or 1 edge are first-player-winning. Hence, a(3)=4.
%t A291342 We need to download the database of nonisomorphic simple graphs from http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/graphs.html
