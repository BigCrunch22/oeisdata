%N A291046 Minimal multiplicative semigroup of numbers n > 1 such that in the prime factorization of n an initial product of primes is greater than a later prime in the factorization.
%C A291046 Definition: Let a number n>1 have prime factorization n=p1^e1*...*pi^ei*..*pm^em, with the primes written in ascending order and the ei>0. If an initial product p1*..*pi is greater than some later prime p(i+1), then n is in the sequence. The definition contains a more restrictive requirement than A289484 does, so it is a proper subsemigroup of A289484.  It can be seen that if s and t are in the sequence, the so is s*t. More strongly, if n is in the sequence, so is every multiple of n. Any number in it is divisible by at least 3 primes, although that is not a sufficient condition.
%C A291046 Differs from A212666 first at a(93), because 930=2*3*5*31 is in this sequence but not in A212666. - _R. J. Mathar_, Sep 02 2018
%C A291046 Numbers whose squarefree kernel (A007947) is in A164596. - _Peter Munn_, Feb 05 2024
