%N A291577 a(n) = largest prime factor of a(n-1), or smallest multiple of that factor not yet in the sequence; a(0)=1, a(1)=2.
%C A291577 Serves as a sieve to indicate the appearance of a new prime (at the descents). Primes enter in increasing order.

%C A291577 Where n occurs, or -1 if it does not: 0, 1, 4, 2, 8, 3, 14, -1, 5, 9, 24, 6, 36, 15, 7, -1, 52, -1, 70, 10, 16, 25, 92, -1, 11, 37, -1, 17, 120, 12, 150, -1, 26, 53, 13, -1, 186, 71, 38, -1, 226, 18, 268, 27, -1, 93, 314, -1, 19, -1, etc.
