%N A291806 The number of polyomino tilings of n X n square.
%C A291806 The sequence gives the number of distinct tilings by polyominoes of a square with side n. As for "free" polyominoes, tilings that are reflections or rotations of each other are not considered distinct.
%C A291806 Using the same terminology used for polyominoes: the corresponding sequence for "fixed" tilings is 1,12,1434,1691690, and for one-sided tilings is 1,5,222,213315.
