%N A291069 Largest number of distinct words arising in Watanabe's tag system {00, 0111} applied to a binary word w, over all starting words w of length n.
%C A291069 Watanabe's tag system {00, 0111} maps a word w over {0,1} to w', where if w begins with 0, w' is obtained by appending 00 to w and deleting the first three letters, or if w begins with 1, w' is obtained by appending 0111 to w and deleting the first three letters.
%C A291069 The empty word is included in the count.
%C A291069 Comment from _Don Reble_, Aug 25 2017: (Start)
%C A291069 The following comment applies to both the 3-shift tag systems {00,1110} (A291068) and {00,0111} (A291069). Number the bits in a binary word w starting at the left with bit 0. For the trajectory of w under the tag system, only bits numbered 0,3,6,9,... are important, the others (the unimportant bits) having no effect on the outcome.
%C A291069 An important 1 bit produces 0111 or 1110, and exactly one of those new 1 bits is important. The number of important 1's never changes. So the number of initial words of length n that terminate (the analog of A289670) is just 2^(number-of-unimportant-bits) = 2^(floor(2*n/3)) = A291778.
%C A291069 The number that end in a cycle is 2^n - 2^(floor(2*n/3)) = A291779.
%C A291069 Furthermore, the number of important zeros is eventually bounded.
%C A291069 Proof. If a word has A important zeros and B important ones, then after A+B steps, there will be at most 2A+4B bits, and at most (2A+4B+2)/3 important bits. B of them are important ones, so at most (2A+B+2)/3 are important zeros.
%C A291069 If A >= B+3, then (2A+B+2)/3 <= (2A+A-1)/3 < A. If A < B+3, then (2A+B+2)/3 < (3B+8)/3 = B+2. The first kind must shrink; the second kind can't grow past A+B+2. QED
%C A291069 Ultimately, a word with B important ones has at most A+B+2 important bits, so can't diverge. So the word "finite" in the definition was unnecessary and has been omitted. (End)
