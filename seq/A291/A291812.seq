%N A291812 Twelve-hole chromatic harmonica standard tone solo layout.
%C A291812 On a chromatic harmonica, for every hole there are four possible tones (not considering the tones that could be produced by bending): blow, blow with slider pressed in, draw, draw with slider pressed in. On a 12-hole chromatic harmonica, there are 48 possible combinations. However, a standard tone layout only has 38 different tones due to repeating tones of the same pitch.
%C A291812 This sequence is the number of semitones away from the root tone on a twelve-hole chromatic harmonica, where n=1 is hole 1, blow without activation of slider; n=2 is hole 1, blow with activation of slider; n=3 is hole 1, draw without activation of slider; n=4 is hole 1, draw with activation of slider; n=5 is hole 2, blow without activation of slider, ...
%C A291812 Please note the change in pattern at the end of the sequence. This is due to the musical flexibility in melody playing obtained by having tones that are one and two semitones higher than the octaves of the root tone.
%C A291812 The sequence can be used to compute the tone layout of a twelve-hole chromatic harmonica in standard solo tone layout in different keys, i.e., with different root tone.
