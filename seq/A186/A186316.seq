%N A186316 Adjusted joint rank sequence of (f(i)) and (g(j)) with f(i) before g(j) when f(i)=g(j), where f and g are the squares and hexagonal numbers.  Complement of A186315.
%e A186316 First, write
%e A186316 1..4...9...16..25....36....49. (squares)
%e A186316 1....6...15.......28....45.... (hexagonal)
%e A186316 Replace each number by its rank, where ties are settled by ranking the square number before the hexagonal:
%e A186316 a=(1,3,5,7,8,10,12,13,...)=A186315.
%e A186316 b=(2,4,6,9,11,14,16,18,...)=A186316.
