%N A186699 Numbers n such that there are n numbers in arithmetic progression whose squares sum to a perfect square.
%C A186699 A positive integer n is in this sequence if and only if there is a solution to the Pell-like equation x^2-ny^2=d^2(n-1)n(n+1)/3 for some x,y,d integers.
%C A186699 A positive integer n is in this sequence if and only if it can be written in the form: (u^2-3w^2)/(v^2+3w^2), with u,v,w integers and gcd(v,w)=1. This can also be written as a  n(v^2) + 3(n+1)(w^2) = z^2.
%C A186699 If n is in this sequence, then we can find an arithmetic progression of *positive* integers which satisfy this equation. (The description above does not require the sequence to be positive.)
%C A186699 By using the method of Legendre to find whether there exists rational numbers r,s on the curve nr^2 + 3(n+1)s^2 = 1, we get the following necessary and sufficient conditions on n:
%C A186699   A. Factor n=a^2b, with b squarefree, then
%C A186699     1. If 3 does not divide b(n+1), then b ≅ 1 (mod 3)
%C A186699     2. If b is divisible by 3, then b ≅ 6 (mod 9)
%C A186699     3. 3 is a square (mod b.)
%C A186699   B.
%C A186699     1. If n+1 is divisible by 3, then (n+1)/3 is the sum of two perfect squares
%C A186699     2. If n+1 is not divisible by 3, then n+1 is the sum of two perfect squares
%C A186699 When n is a perfect square, we can use the arithmetic sequence starting at m=(3n+2)(sqrt(n)-1)/2 + 6 and common difference 6.

%e A186699 For n=4, (13,19,25,31) is an arithmetic progression of length 4, and 13^2+19^2+25^2+31^2 = 46^2, so 4 is in the sequence.
%Y A186699 Cf. A134419 is a subsequence.
