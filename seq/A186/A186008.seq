%N A186008 Irregular triangle T(n,k) read by rows, in which row n has the pattern of conjectured dropping times in the Collatz iteration.
%C A186008 Consider A126241, the sequence of dropping times in the Collatz iteration. Only zero and the numbers in A020914 can be dropping times. The dropping times in A126241 have a definite pattern. For example, 1 appears at positions n = 2 + 2*i, for i=0,1,2,3,... Similarly, 2 appears at positions n = 5 + 4*i; 4 appears at n = 3 + 16*i; 5 appears at n = 11 + {12,32}*i; and 7 appears at 7 + {8, 52, 128}*i. In general, if we let s=A020914(r) be the r-th possible stopping time, then A126241(n) = s for n = A122442(r) + T(r)*i, where T(r) is the r-th row of this triangle.  The length of row n is A186009(n). The n-th row ends with 2^A020914(n).
%C A186008 The frequency of the r-th dropping time s=A020914(r) can be computed as A186009(r)/2^s. The first few frequencies are 1/2, 1/4, 1/16, 1/16, 3/128, 7/256, 3/256, 15/2048, and 85/8192.
%C A186008 The term "stopping time" is sometimes used instead of "dropping time", but the former usually refers to A006666.
%C A186008 This sequence is closely related to A177789.
