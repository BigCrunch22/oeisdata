%N A186372 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of permutations p of [n] such that the number of inversions of the word formed by the leading entries of the blocks of p is k. A block of a permutation is a maximal sequence of consecutive integers which appear in consecutive positions. For example, the permutation 5412367 has 4 blocks: 5, 4, 123, and 67; their leading entries are 5,4,1, and 6 and the word 5416 has 3 inversions.
%C A186372 Row n has 1+n(n-1)/2 entries.
%C A186372 Sum of entries in row n is n!.
%C A186372 T(n,0)=1.
%C A186372 T(n,1)=binomial(n+1,3); select 3 points a,b,c from the n+1 points that delimit the n entries of the identity permutation and interchange the segment between a and b with the segment between b and c. For example, if n=7, then for the selection 123a4b567c we obtain 1235674; the leading entries of its blocks are 1,5, and 4; the word 154 has 1 inversion.
%C A186372 Apparently, T(n,2) = binomial(n+2,6) (proof ?).
%C A186372 See the related concept of "profile" in the Atkinson reference (p. 32).
%C A186372 The entries have been obtained by direct counting (via Maple).

%e A186372 T(5,2)=7 because we have 13254, 21354, 21435, 21453, 21534, 23154, and 31254; the words formed by the leading entries of their blocks are 13254, 21354, 21435, 2143, 2153, 2154, and 3154, respectivey, each having 2 inversions.
