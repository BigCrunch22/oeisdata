%N A186331 Adjusted joint rank sequence of (f(i)) and (g(j)) with f(i) after g(j) when f(i)=g(j), where f and g are the pentagonal numbers and the hexagonal numbers.  Complement of A186330.
%C A186331 Does this differ from A186329 only at a(1)? - _R. J. Mathar_, Jan 09 2024
%e A186331 First, write
%e A186331 1..5...12....22.....35......  (pentagonal)
%e A186331 1....6....15....28.......45.. (hexagonal)
%e A186331 Then replace each number by its rank, where ties are settled by ranking the pentagonal after the hexagonal:
%e A186331 a=(2,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,16,....)=A186330
%e A186331 b=(1,4,6,8,10,12,14,17,19,...)=A186331.
%t A186331 (See A186330.)
