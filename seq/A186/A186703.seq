%N A186703 Balanced ternary non-Harshad numbers.
%C A186703 Numbers not divisible by the sum of their balanced ternary digits.
%C A186703 All terms of A174658 are in this sequence because their balanced ternary digits add up to 0.
%C A186703 Terms of this sequence not in A174658 are generally prime numbers.
%e A186703 The balanced ternary representation of 13 is {1, 1, 1}, which adds up to 3. Since 3 does not divide 13 evenly, 13 is in the list.
%e A186703 The balanced ternary representation of 17 is {1, -1, 0, -1}, this adds up to -1, which divides 17 evenly. Therefore, 17 is not in the list.
