%N A186432 Triangle associated with the set S of squares {0,1,4,9,16,...}.
%C A186432 Given a subset S of the integers Z, Bhargava [1] has shown how to associate with S a generalized factorial function, denoted n!_S, sharing many properties of the classical factorial function n! (which corresponds to the choice S = Z). In particular, he shows that the generalized binomial coefficients n!_S/(k!_S*(n-k)!_S) are always integral for any choice of S. Here we take S = {0,1,4,9,16,...}, the set of squares.
%C A186432 The associated generalized factorial function n!_S is given by the formula
%C A186432 n!_S = Product_{k=0..n} (n^2 - k^2), with the convention 0!_S = 1. This should be compared with n! = Product_{k=0..n} (n - k).
%C A186432 For n >= 1, n!_S = (2*n)!/2 = A002674(n).
%C A186432 Compare this triangle with A086645 and also A186430 - the generalized binomial coefficients for the set S of prime numbers {2,3,5,7,11,...}.

%F A186432 T(n,k) = n!_S/(k!_S*(n-k)!_S),

%F A186432 T(n,k) = 2*binomial(2*n,2*k) for 1 <= k < n,
%F A186432 with boundary conditions T(n,0) = 1 and T(n,n) = 1 for n >= 0.
%F A186432 RELATIONS WITH OTHER SEQUENCES
%F A186432 Denote this triangle by T. The first column of the inverse T^-1 (see A186433) begins [1, -1, 11, -301, 15371, ...] and, apart from the initial 1, is a signed version of the Glaisher's H' numbers A002114.
%F A186432 The first column of (1/2)*T^2 begins [1/2, 1, 7, 31, 127, ...] and, apart from the initial term, equals A000225(2*n-1), counting the preferential arrangements on (2*n - 1) labeled elements having less than or equal to two ranks.
%F A186432 The first column of (1/3)*T^3 begins [1/3, 1, 13, 181, 1933, ...] and, apart from the initial term, is A101052(2*n-1), which gives the number of preferential arrangements on (2*n-1) labeled elements having less than or equal to three ranks.
