%T A186116 1
%N A186116 Number of nonisomorphic rings with n elements minus number of groups of order n.
%C A186116 a(p) = 1 for p prime, as there is a unique group of order p (the cyclic group), and 2 nonisomorphic rings with p elements, so 2 - 1 = 1.
%C A186116 a(p^2) = 9 for p prime, as there are 11 mutually nonisomorphic rings of order p^2 [Raghavendran, p. 228] and 2 groups of order p^2, so 11 - 2 = 9.
%C A186116 a(p^3) = 3*p+45 for p an odd prime, as there are 3*p+50 nonisomorphic rings with p^3 elements [R. Ballieu, Math. Rev. 9, 267; see also Math. Rev. 51#5655]; see also Antipkin, and 5 nonisomorphic groups of order p^3.
%C A186116 The first unknown value as of Feb 13, 2011 is a(32). Then a(64) is unknown.
%C A186116 In a sense, this measures the excess in combinatorial structures available by moving from one binary operation to two binary operations, and moving from the group axioms to the ring axioms.

%F A186116 a(n) = A027623(n) - A000001(n).
%e A186116 a(1) = 0 because there is a unique ring with 1 element, and a unique group of order 1, so 1 - 1 = 0.
