%N A186318 Adjusted joint rank sequence of (f(i)) and (g(j)) with f(i) after g(j) when f(i)=g(j), where f and g are the squares and hexagonal numbers.  Complement of A186317.
%e A186318 First, write
%e A186318 1..4...9...16..25....36....49. (squares)
%e A186318 1....6...15.......28....45.... (hexagonal)
%e A186318 Replace each number by its rank, where ties are settled by ranking the square number after the hexagonal:
%e A186318 a=(2,3,5,7,8,10,12,13,...)=A186317.
%e A186318 b=(1,4,6,9,11,14,16,18,...)=A186318.
