%N A186329 Adjusted joint rank sequence of (f(i)) and (g(j)) with f(i) before g(j) when f(i)=g(j), where f and g are the pentagonal numbers and the hexagonal numbers.  Complement of A186328.
%e A186329 First, write
%e A186329 1..5...12....22.....35......  (pentagonal)
%e A186329 1....6....15....28.......45.. (hexagonal)
%e A186329 Then replace each number by its rank, where ties are settled by ranking the pentagonal number before the hexagonal:
%e A186329 a=(1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,16,....)=A186328
%e A186329 b=(2,4,6,8,10,12,14,17,19,...)=A186329.
%t A186329 (See A186328.)
