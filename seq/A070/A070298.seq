%N A070298 Let Unrel(m) = number of unrelated numbers less than m; then a(n) = number of values of m for which Unrel(m) = n.
%C A070298 a(0), not included in the sequence, is infinite, as no prime has any unrelated number.
%C A070298 Apparently this gives the indices k such that A045763(k)=n. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jun 27 2007
