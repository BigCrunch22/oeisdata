%N A070862 Number of path covers of an n X n grid.
%C A070862 A path cover is set of disjoint paths such that each node of the graph belongs to exactly one of these. A Hamiltonian path is a special path cover consisting of a single path. Paths of length zero (i.e. single nodes) are permitted.
%e A070862 a(1) = 1 as there is only the trivial cover by a single path of length 0
%e A070862 a(2) = 15 = 1 (all length 0) + 4 (2x0, 1x1) + 2 (2x1) + 4 (1x2, 1x0) + 4 (1x3)
