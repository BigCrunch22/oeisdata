%N A070060 Historical estimate for the mass of an electron (in kg). Incorrect version of A081801.
%C A070060 9.103897(54)*10^-31 kg. Numbers in parentheses are approximations.
%C A070060 This is an obsolete version of A081801. The discrepancy is likely due to the fact that the accepted value for alpha, the fine structure constant (A005600), has changed significantly since the 1990's and this sequence uses a reference from that time period. - _M.
