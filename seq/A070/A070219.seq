%N A070219 Smallest prime obtained as a concatenation of n and a number m greater than n.
%C A070219 If we change the definition to m >= n, then a(1) becomes 11, but nothing else changes.
%C A070219 Conjectures: There is at least one number k with n<k<2n such that the concatenation n and n+k is a prime. For all m there is at least one number k with m*n < k < (m+1)*n such that the concatenation n and n+k is a prime.
