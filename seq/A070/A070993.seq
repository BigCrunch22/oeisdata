%N A070993 Numbers n such that the trajectory of n under the "3x+1" map reaches n+1.
%C A070993 From Collatz conjecture, the trajectory of n never reaches n again. Is this sequence finite? (it seems there are no further terms below 10^6).
%C A070993 There are no more terms < 10^9. - _Donovan Johnson_, Sep 22 2013
%e A070993 Trajectory of 39 is (118, 59, 178, 89, 268, 134, 67, 202, 101, 304, 152, 76, 38, 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1) which contains 39+1=40, so 39 is in the sequence.
