%N A070911 a(n) is twice the least possible area enclosed by a convex lattice n-gon.
%C A070911 A convex lattice n-gon is a polygon whose n vertices are points on the integer lattice Z^2 and whose interior angles are strictly less than Pi.
%C A070911 From _Jamie Simpson_, Dec 08 2022: (Start)
%C A070911 The even-indexed values are exact. These were obtained using an algorithm described in the paper by Simpson. They are also given in A089187. There is no known general method for finding the minimum area of an n-sided lattice polygon for odd n. The values which are known are a(3)=1 (trivial), a(5)=5 and a(7)=13 (Arkinstall), a(9)=21 (Rabinowitz), a(11)=43 (Olszewska), a(13)=65 (Simpson), and a(15)=103 (Castryck). For other values we have closed intervals known to contain a(n). These are [147,151] for a(17), [209,213] for a(19), [285,289] for a(21), [375,387] for a(23) and [483,497] for a(25). [Intervals corrected by _Christelle Guichard_, Jan 05 2023]
%C A070911 The lower bounds come from a formula in Simpson's paper and the upper bounds come from _Hugo Pfoertner_ and were obtained "by massive calculations with several independent search programs". They may well be the actual values. Pfortner has made nice pictures of the best polygons he has found. See his link below. (End)
