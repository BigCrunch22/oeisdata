%N A070911 a(n) is twice the least possible area enclosed by a convex lattice n-gon.
%C A070911 A convex lattice n-gon is a polygon whose n vertices are points on the integer lattice Z^2 and whose interior angles are strictly less than Pi.
%C A070911 For the even-indexed values, see A089187. The precisely known odd values were a(3)=1 (trivial), a(5)=5 and a(7)=13 (Arkinstall), a(9)=21 (Rabinowitz), a(11)=43 (Olszewska), a(13)=65 (Simpson), and a(15)=103 (Castryck). Additional values up to a(25) were first obtained as upper bounds "by massive calculations with several independent search programs" by _Hugo Pfoertner_. Pfoertner has made nice pictures of the best polygons he has found. See his link below. - _Jamie Simpson_, Dec 08 2022, adapted by _Günter Rote_, Sep 18 2023
%C A070911 From _Günter Rote_, Sep 18 2023: (Start)
%C A070911 The values a(n) can be computed in time polynomial in n by an algorithm of Eppstein, Overmars, Rote, and Woeginger from 1992: They showed how to compute the smallest convex n-gon in a set of N points in O(nN^3) time. The N points can be taken as an O(n^2) X O(n^2) grid: Each dimension of the bounding rectangle must be at least n/2, because a horizontal or vertical line can contain at most two vertices; since the area is known to be bounded by n^3, the other dimension cannot exceed 4n^2. In our case, the runtime can be reduced to O(nN^2), since the lowest vertex can be assumed to be a fixed point, say, the origin. By considering the lattice width, the grid can be reduced to size N=O(n^2) X O(n^1.5). Overall, this yields a theoretical runtime bound of O(n^8), for reporting all k-gons up to size n. This estimate agrees roughly with the observed runtimes in practice.
%C A070911 I have implemented the algorithm in Python and uploaded the program to the Code Golf Stackexchange site. It runs up to a(40) in a couple of minutes and produces some smallest polygon for each n. The values up to a(102) have been computed on a workstation in 31 hours. (End)
