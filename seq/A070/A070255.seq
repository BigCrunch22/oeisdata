%N A070255 Numbers which divided into two substrings by breaking at any digit then one of them divides the other (0 is not to be considered a substring, multiples of 10 are excluded).
%C A070255 Conjecture: sequence is finite.
%C A070255 The conjecture above is false as terms of the form d00...00d, where d goes from 1 to 9, are always in the sequence. - _FUNG Cheok Yin_, Aug 12 2021

%e A070255 168 is a member as the possible substring partitions are (1,68 ) and (16,8). 1 divides 68 and 8 divides 16. 111111 is also a member with substring partitions (1,11111),(11,1111),(111,111),(1111,11),(11111,1). 1111111 is not a member as in the sub string partition (111,1111) 111 does not divide 1111.
