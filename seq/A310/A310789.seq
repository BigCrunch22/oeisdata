%N A310789 Coordination sequence Gal.6.480.2 where Gal.u.t.v denotes the coordination sequence for a vertex of type v in tiling number t in the Galebach list of u-uniform tilings.
%C A310789 Note that there may be other vertices in the Galebach list of u-uniform tilings with u <= 6 that have this same coordination sequence. See the Galebach link for the complete list of A-numbers for all these tilings.
