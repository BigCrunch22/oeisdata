%S A103850 2,3,5,7,11,89
%N A103850 Primes with digits not in all previous terms.
%C A103850 Finite sequence: there is no other term if a) sequence is increasing and b) each next term is minimal possible. If any condition is changed, sequence contains other terms but stay finite. E.g. 2,3,5,67,89,401 (6 terms, all 10 digits used!), or 2-term sequences 2,103456789 and 4,102356789 etc. What is the pair of two primes p1, p2 containing all 10 digits with the minimum sum p1+p2? Is the 23567 + 18049=41616 OK?
