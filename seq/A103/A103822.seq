%N A103822 Table of "minimum oddness" operation.
%C A103822 T(i,j) is whichever of i,j has the 0 in the rightmost differing bit of their binary representations. Defines a complete ordering of the integers: all even numbers are "less odd" than all odd numbers, for numbers of same parity remaining bits are recursively compared to determine ordering.

%F A103822 T(i, j) = min(Ri, Rj), where Rn is the reflection of n at the "binary point".
%e A103822 T(11,13)=13, since the rightmost differing bit position is 1 for 11=1011 binary and 0 for 13=1101 binary.
