%N A103902 Mersenne primes p such that the Mersenne number M(p) = 2^p - 1 is composite.
%C A103902 Only four terms are known.
%C A103902 The first four Mersenne primes (p=2^q-1 in A000668) are double Mersenne primes, i.e., in A103901. The next four yield a composite M(p) and therefore are in this sequence. The next larger Mersenne prime p = A000668(9) has already 19 digits and is much too large to enable us, as of today, to test the primality of 2^p-1 (which would require over 10^8 gigabytes just to be stored in binary). This explains that only 4 terms are known of this sequence and of A103901; for all the 30+ remaining members of A000668 it is not known whether they belong to A103901 or to this sequence A103902. - _M.
