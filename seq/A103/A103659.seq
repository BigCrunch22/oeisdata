%N A103659 (1/6) * most frequently occurring volume assumed by triangular pyramids with their 4 vertices chosen from distinct points of an (n+1)X(n+1)X(n+1) lattice cube.
%e A103659 a(1)=1 because 2*A103660(1)=56 of the 2*A103656(1)=58 triangular pyramids that can be formed from the vertices of a cube have volume=1/6. The other two pyramids have volume=1/3.
%Y A103659 Cf. A103660 = number of occurrences of the most frequent volume. For more cross-references see A103657.
