%N A103775 Number of ways to write n! as product of distinct squarefree numbers.
%C A103775 From _Gus Wiseman_, Aug 23 2020: (Start)
%C A103775 Also the number of set-systems (sets of sets) whose multiset union is the multiset of prime factors of n!. For example, the a(1) = 1 through a(7) = 3 set-systems (empty columns indicated by dots) are:
%C A103775   0  {1}  {1,2}    .  {1},{1,2},{1,3}  .  {1},{1,2},{1,3},{1,2,4}
%C A103775           {1},{2}                         {1},{1,2},{1,4},{1,2,3}
