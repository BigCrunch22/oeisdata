%N A103663 Smallest integer base x > 1 such that x^n has no digit 0 in its decimal representation, or 0 if no such x exists.
%C A103663 Bases associated with A103662. [Corrected by _M. F. Hasler_, Mar 09 2014]
%C A103663 Zero values are conjectural. a(40) was checked up to 10^9 by _Joshua Zucker_. All other zero values were checked up to 10^5 by _David Wasserman_.
%e A103663 a(10) = 5 because 5^10 is the smallest 10th power containing no zero in its decimal representation (2^10 = 1024, 3^10 = 59049, 4^10 = 1048576).
%Y A103663 Cf. A103662 = smallest power x^n with integer x>1 that has no digit 0 in its decimal representation.
%Y A103663 A007377 gives n such that a(n) = 2. Cf. A008839, A030700-A030706.
