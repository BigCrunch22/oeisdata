%N A103865 a(1) = 1; a(n) is the smallest positive integer not occurring earlier in the sequence if n is a composite. a(n) = a(n-1)th smallest positive integer among those not occurring earlier in the sequence if n is prime.
%C A103865 Sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A103865 Since 5 is prime, a(5) = a(4)th (3rd) smallest positive integer not occurring earlier in the sequence. The terms not occurring earlier in the sequence are 5,6,7,8,9,... and the 3rd of these is 7.
