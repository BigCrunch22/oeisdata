%N A103441 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = number of bracelets of n beads (necklaces that can be flipped over) with exactly two colors and k white beads for which the set of distances among the white beads are different.
%C A103441 If two bracelets can be made to coincide by rotation or flipping over they necessarily have the same set of distances, but the reverse is obviously not true.
%C A103441 Offset is 2, since exactly two colors are required, ergo at least two beads.
%C A103441 T[2n,n] equals A045611. Row sums equal A103442.
%C A103441 Same as A052307, except for bracelets such as {0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1} and{0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1}, that both have the same set of distances between the "1" beads: 4 d[0]+ 4 d[1]+ 2 d[2]+ 4 d[3]+ 2 d[4], where d[k] represents the unidirectional distance between two beads k places apart.
