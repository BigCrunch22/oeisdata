%N A103981 Number of prime factors (with multiplicity) of octahedral numbers (A005900).
%C A103981 When a(n) = 2, n is a term of A103982: indices of octahedral numbers (A005900) which are semiprimes.

%F A103981 a(n) = A001222(A005900(n)), n>0. a(n) = Bigomega((2*n^3 + n)/3), n>0.
%e A103981 a(3) = 1 because OctahedralNumber(3) = A005900(3) = 19, which is prime and thus has only one prime factor. Because the cubic polynomial for octahedral numbers factors into n time a quadratic, the octahedral numbers can never be prime after a(3) = 19.
%e A103981 a(4) = 3 because A005900(4) = (2*4^3 + 4)/3 = 44 = 2 * 2 * 11, which has (with multiplicity) three prime factors.
