%N A103147 Least k such that k+n and k-n are both prime but k-m and k+m are not both prime for any 0 <= m < n.
%C A103147 First appearance of n in A047160.
%C A103147 It appears that a(3n) is less than a(3n-1) and a(3n+1) for all n except 2 and 12. The lower and upper primes are A155766(n) and A155767(n). - _T. D. Noe_, Jan 26 2009
%C A103147 No odd primes are in this sequence. - _Lei Zhou_, Mar 06 2012

%e A103147 a(0)=2 because 2-0 and 2+0 are primes. 2 is the least such value.
%e A103147 a(1)=4 because 4-1 and 4+1 are prime, but 4-0 and 4-0 are not prime. 4 is the least such value.
%e A103147 a(2)=9 because 9-2 and 9+2 are prime, but (8,10) and (9,9) are not prime pairs. 9 is the least such value.
%e A103147 a(3)=8 because 8-3 and 8+3 are prime, but (6,10), (7,9) and (8,8) are not prime pairs. 8 is the least such value.
%e A103147 a(11)=222 because 211 and 233 are prime, but (222-m,222+m) is not a prime pair for any m<11. 222 is the least such value.
