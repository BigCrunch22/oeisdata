%N A103864 a(1) = 1; a(n) = smallest positive integer not occurring earlier in sequence if n is a prime. a(n) = a(n-1)th smallest positive integer among those not occurring earlier in sequence if n is composite.
%C A103864 Sequence is a permutation of the positive integers.

%e A103864 Since 6 is composite, a(6) = a(5)th (4th) smallest positive integer not occurring earlier in sequence. The terms not occurring earlier in sequence are 5,7,8,9,10... and the 4th of these is 9.
