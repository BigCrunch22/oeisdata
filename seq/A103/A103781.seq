%N A103781 Sum of any four successive terms is prime, a(1)=a(2)=0,a(3)=1.
%C A103781 The sequence depends on initial three terms. Assuming no negative sequence we have ten distinct sets of first terms. We may denote them in short as s000,s001(=this sequence),s010,s011,s100,s101,s110,s002,s020 and s200. These sequences do not merge into each other, but maintain their individuality. E.g. terms nos. 97-100 are: {128,107,162,144},{127,107,162,145},{127,107,163,144}, 126,107,163,145},{127,108,162,144},{126,108,162,145},{126,108,163,144},{126,107,162,146},{126,107,164,144},{126,109,162,144}, for above mentioned sequences, respectively. The same is true for the case of "sum of three successive terms" A073737, where we have six distinct sets of first terms s00,s01,s10,s11(=A073737),s02 and s20.
