%N A103329 Numbers n such that (1+i)^n - i is a Gaussian prime.
%C A103329 Note that A027206 and A057429 treat Gaussian primes of a similar form. The remaining case, (1+i)^n + 1, is a Gaussian prime for n=1,2,3,4 only.
%C A103329 Let z = (1+i)^n - i. If z is not pure real or pure imaginary, then z is a Gaussian prime if the product of z and its conjugate is a rational prime. That product is 1 + 2^n - sin(n*Pi/4)*2^(1+n/2). z is real when n=1. z is imaginary when n=4k+2, in which case, z has magnitude 2^(2k+1) - (-1)^k. These pure imaginary numbers are Gaussian primes when 2^(2k+1)-1 is a Mersenne prime and 2k+1 = 3 (mod 4); that is, when n is twice an odd number in A112634. - T. D. Noe, Mar 07 2011
