%S A103830 2,11,29,2999
%N A103830 a(1) = 2; a(n+1) = smallest number > a(n) whose sum of digits is a(n).
%C A103830 a(5) = 3*10^333-1 = 2999...999 with 333 9's and contains 334 digits.
%C A103830 Surprisingly enough the first four terms are all primes and match those of A062802, but a(5) is divisible by 65033 and is different from A062802(5).

%F A103830 For n>=3, a(n) = (a(n-1) mod 9 + 1)*10^floor(a(n-1)/9) - 1. - _Max Alekseyev_, Aug 13 2015
%F A103830 For n>=3, a(n) = 3*10^b(n) - 1, where b(3)=1 and for n>=4, b(n)=(10^b(n-1)-1)/3. In other words, decimal representation of b(n) is formed by digit 3 repeated b(n-1) times.  - _Max Alekseyev_, Aug 13 2015
