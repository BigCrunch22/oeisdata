%N A068435 Consecutive prime powers without a prime between them.
%C A068435 From _David A. Corneth_, Aug 24 2019: (Start)
%C A068435 Only 5 pairs are known up to 4*10^18. Legendre's conjecture states that there is a prime number between n^2 and (n + 1)^2 for every positive integer n. The conjecture has been verified up to n = 2*10^9. So to that bound we only have to check for two prime powers where at least one has an exponent of at least 3. That has been done to prime powers <= 10^22.
%C A068435 If there is another pair besides the first five listed with both numbers <= 10^22 then Legendre's conjecture is false.
%C A068435 Proof: If there is another such pair with both numbers <= 10^22 then it must be of the form [p^2, q^2] where p is a prime and q is the least prime larger than p. Then q - p >= 2 (as p != 2). So there is no prime between p^2 and q^2 and hence there is no prime between p^2 and (p+1)^2. This is a counterexample to Legendre's conjecture. (End)

%e A068435 8 = 2^3, 9 = 3^2, there is no prime between 8 and 9.
%e A068435 25 = 5^2, 27 = 3^3, there is no prime between 25 and 27.
