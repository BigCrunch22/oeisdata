%N A068843 Smallest prime in the first occurrence of a nondecreasing difference for a set of exactly n successive primes.
%C A068843 This is the same as asking for the smallest prime in the first occurrence of a nonnegative second difference for a set of n successive primes.

%e A068843 The prime 2 starts the first run of exactly 4 nondecreasing gaps (1, 2, 2, 4) between the 5 primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11). (The next gap would be of 2, smaller than 4.) Therefore a(4) = 2.
%e A068843 The prime 11 starts the first run of exactly 2 nondecreasing gaps (2, 4) between the 3 primes (11, 13, 17). (The preceding gap is 4 > 2 and the next gap would be 2 < 4.) Therefore a(2) = 11. The sequences of primes (2, 3, 5) as well as (5, 7, 11) are part of a longer run of nondecreasing gaps and are therefore not considered for the case n = 2.
%e A068843 The prime 17 starts the first run of exactly 3 nondecreasing gaps (2, 4, 4) between the 4 primes (17, 19, 23, 29). (The preceding gap is 4 > 2 and the next gap would be 2 < 4.) Therefore a(3) = 17. Again, primes which are part of a longer run cannot be considered.
%e A068843 The prime 37 starts the first run of exactly 1 nondecreasing gap (4) between the primes 37 and 41. (The preceding gap is 6 > 4 and the next gap would be 2 < 4.) Therefore a(1) = 37.
