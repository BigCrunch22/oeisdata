%N A068182 Number of combinatorially non-equivalent "triangulations" of a compact genus n surface which have only 1 vertex (all vertices of the triangles are identified). Also the number of combinatorially distinct identifications of pairs of edges of a polygone P having 12g-6 sides leading to a compact oriented genus g surface containing the boundary of P as a 3-regular graph.
%C A068182 In the Krasko paper p. 18, Table 2, this sequence is designated "tautilde^(3)_(+)(g)" and has offset 1. - _Michael De Vlieger_, Oct 31 2021

%F A068182 Reference gives a formula. Another formula can be derived by use of characters of the symmetric groups.
%e A068182 The first term, 1, is associated to the usual construction of the torus: identify opposite sides of a square. The 1-vertex triangulation is obtained by subdividing the square into 2 triangles along a diagonal. Another point of view is to identify opposite sides of a hexagon (thus getting a torus). The 1-vertex triangulation is the dual of the boundary of the hexagon (which is a graph having 2 nodes and a triple edge between them) drawn on the torus.
