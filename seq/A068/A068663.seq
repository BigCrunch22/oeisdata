%N A068663 Let N = 23571113171923293137... the concatenation of primes; partition this number into minimal strings of composite numbers.
%C A068663 This could be roughly rephrased like this: "Rewrite in the most economical way the prime number 'pattern' using only composite numbers." - _Michael De Vlieger_, Nov 30 2015, after _Danny Rorabaugh_ at A097487.

%e A068663 From _Michael De Vlieger_, Nov 30 2015: (Start)
%e A068663 We begin with N = 235711131719..., taking first digits until we have a composite concatenation. Since 2 and 23 are prime, 235 is the first term. We continue with 711131719... and since 7 and 71 are prime, 711 is the next term.
%e A068663 Composite terms are formed such that the following term has no leading zeros, so as to preserve all the digits of N.
%e A068663 The terms {710, 110, 310, 710} derive from the primes {97, 101, 103, 107, 109} and happen to be formed because eliding the zero would result in a prime in these cases.
%e A068663 a(70) = 330 because although 33 would suffice as it is composite, the zero leading next digits 07311313... would result in a(71) losing a digit of N. (End)
