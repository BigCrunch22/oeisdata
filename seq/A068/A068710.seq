%N A068710 Primes whose digits can be arranged in increasing cyclic order - to form a substring of 123456789012345678901234567890...
%C A068710 Observe that the digits 0 and 9 do not appear in any 4-digit or 7-digit prime in this sequence. Also note that no 10-digit prime has this form (since the sum of 10 consecutive digits is divisible by 3).
%H A068710 T. D. Noe and David Consiglio, Jr., <a href="/A068710/b068710.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..9463</a> (terms < 5 x 10^7. The 1287 terms < 10^7 were entered by T. D. Noe.)
%e A068710 2143 is a term as its digits can be arranged as 1234.
%e A068710 109 is a terms since the digits can be permuted to give 901.

%E A068710 Jan 22 2011: There were omissions after the term 6857 (10243 for example), so I deleted the terms beyond this point, and the presumably erroneous Mma program that accompanied them. Thanks to Marco Rip√† for pointing out that there were errors. - _N. J. A. Sloane_
