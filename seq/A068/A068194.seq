%N A068194 Numbers k for which the only representation of k*(k+1)/2 as a sum of 2 or more consecutive positive integers is 1+2+...+k.
%C A068194 Consists of 1, Mersenne primes (A000668) and Fermat primes (A019434) minus 1. Proof: The sum of r consecutive integers starting with j is r*(r + 2*j - 1)/2, so k*(k+1)/2 has an extra representation of the desired form iff k*(k+1) = r*s where 1 < r, r+1 < s, and r and s have opposite parity. If k is even, let k = 2^e*m with m odd and let p be a prime divisor of k+1. Then we may take r = 2^e and s = m*(k+1) unless m=1 and we may take r = (k+1)/p and s = k*p unless k+1 is prime. Thus an even number k is in the sequence iff k+1 is a Fermat prime. Similarly an odd number k is in the sequence iff k=1 or k is a Mersenne prime.

%e A068194 k=6 gives 21, which has the 2 representations 1+2+...+6 and 10+11, so 6 is not in the sequence.
%e A068194 k=4 gives 10, whose only representation is 1+2+3+4, so 4 is in the sequence.
