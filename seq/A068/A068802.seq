%N A068802 Smaller of two consecutive squares which have no common digits.
%C A068802 There are no more terms. Sketch of proof: Suppose n^2 and (n+1)^2 have no common digits. Then their first digits differ, so n+1 = ceiling(sqrt(d*10^r)) with 1<=d<=9 and r>=0. In other words,
%C A068802 n+1 = ceiling(sqrt(e*100^s)) with e in {1,2,...,9,10,20,...,90} and s>=0. The cases e=1, 4 and 9 are easy. Otherwise note that about half the digits of (n+1)^2 equal 0, so n^2 has no 0's. We have
%C A068802 (n+1)^2 - n^2 = 2n+1 ~ 10^s*2*sqrt(e). For e=20, this is about 10^s * 8.94427190999916. So for s>=10, the decimal expansion of (n+1)^2 - n^2 has 2 consecutive 9's. (In fact 4 for large s, but 2 is enough.) Since n^2 has no 0's this implies that n^2 and (n+1)^2 have the same digit in the position of the first of the 2 9's. The same idea works for other values of e, but the consecutive 9's occur later.
%e A068802 29997529 is a term since 29997529 and 30008484 are two consecutive squares with no common digits.
