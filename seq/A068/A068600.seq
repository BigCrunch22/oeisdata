%N A068600 Number of n-uniform tilings having n different arrangements of polygons about their vertices.
%C A068600 Sequence gives the number of edge-to-edge regular-polygon tilings having n topologically distinct vertex types, with each vertex type having a different arrangement of surrounding polygons. Does not allow for tilings with two or more vertex types having the same arrangement of surrounding polygons, even when those vertices are topologically distinct. There are no 8- or higher-uniform tilings having the equivalent number of distinct polygon arrangements.
%C A068600 There are eleven 1-uniform tilings (also called the "Archimedean" tessellations) which comprise the three regular tessellations (all triangles, squares, or hexagons) plus the eight semiregular tessellations. (See A250120. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Nov 29 2014)
