%N A068008 Least number needed to be appended to n n's to make a prime that does not contain more than n n's in a row.
%C A068008 This is not quite the "tail" of the numbers in A068120 because of the restriction that a(n) cannot begin with a zero. For example, a(25) = 153; 25252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525153 is a prime, but it is greater than A068120(25) = 25252525252525252525252525252525252525252525252525061. - _Dan Dima_, Jan 29 2007
%e A068008 a(0) = 2 because appending 2 to a zero-length string (i.e., 0 0's) yields 2, which is prime.
%e A068008 a(1) = 3 because appending a 3 to 1 yields 13, which is prime; a(1) is not 1, because appending a 1 to 1 yields 11, which (although prime) contains more than one 1 in a row.
%e A068008 a(2) = 3 because appending a 3 to 22 yields 223 (prime), whereas appending a 1 produces the nonprime 221=13*17.
%Y A068008 Cf. A068120.
