%N A068171 Define an increasing sequence as follows: Given the first term called the seed (the seed need not have the property of the sequence.), subsequent terms are defined as obtained by inserting/placing digits (at least one) in the previous term to obtain the smallest number with a given property. This is the growing prime sequence for the seed a(1) = 6.
