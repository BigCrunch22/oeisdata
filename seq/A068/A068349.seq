%N A068349 Numbers n having a partition n=sum x_i for which Product n/x_i is also a way of factoring n.
%e A068349 36 is in the sequence because 36 has a partition 18+12+6 for which (36/18)*(36/12)*(36/6)=2*3*6 is also a way of factoring 36.
%e A068349 Also, 324 is in the sequence since 54+54+108+108=324 and (324/54)*(324/54)*(324/108)*(324/108)=3*3*6*6=54.
