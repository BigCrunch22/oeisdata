%N A068515 A measure of how close the square root of 2 is to rational numbers.
%C A068515 New peaks (in absolute terms) occur when n is a Pell number (1,2,5,12,29,70,... A000129) and take alternate Pell values with alternating signs (2,-12,70,-408,2378,-13860,... A001542). Each new peak (after the first) appears twice (with different signs) before the next peak, when n is a numerator of a continued fraction convergent to sqrt(2) (3,7,17,41,99,... A001333) and when n is twice a Pell number (4,10,24,58,140,... A052542).
%F A068515 a(n) =round[1/(sqrt(2)-round[sqrt(2)*n]/n)] =round[1/(sqrt(2)-A022846(n)/n)] where sqrt(2)=1.41421356...
%e A068515 a(5) = round[1/(sqrt(2)-round[sqrt(2)*5]/5)] = round[1/(sqrt(2)-7/5)] = round[70.355] = 70, i.e. sqrt(2) is about 1/70 more than the nearest multiple of 1/5.
