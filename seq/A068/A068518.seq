%N A068518 The sequence S(n,-3,1,1), where S(r,k,t,q) is defined by Sum(0<=j<=r){combin(r+q,j)^t*B(j,k)} and B(j,k) is the j-th k-poly-Bernoulli number.
%C A068518 The sequence S(n,-2,1,1), n>=0, is A016269. It would be interesting to study the more general sequences S(r,-m,1,1), r=0,1,2,... for fixed m; here we consider the special cases m=3 and m=2. Finally, one can use the sum S(r,k,t,q) to discover certain recurrence relations involving poly-Bernoulli numbers. Let us note that the well known recurrence of the classical Bernoulli numbers yields S(r,1,1,1)=r+1. Let us also note that numerical experimentation suggests that S(r,-2,1,1)=S(r,-3,0,q).
%F A068518 S(r, -3, 1, 1)=Sum(0<=n<=r){combin(r+1, n)*[(-1)^n*Sum(0<=m<=n){(m+1)^2*Sum(0<=s<=m){(-1)^s*combin(m, s)*s^n}]}
