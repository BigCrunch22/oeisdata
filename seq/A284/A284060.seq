%N A284060 Primes that are left-, left/right-, and right-truncatable.
%C A284060 Intersection of A020994 and A077390. Only the last three terms exhibit all three properties nontrivially.
%e A284060 The prime 3797 is a term because it is a term of A024785 (truncating from the left: 797, 97, 7 are primes), of A077390 (truncating the same number of digits from left and from right: 79 is a prime), and of A024770 (truncating from the right: 379, 37, 3 are primes). The digit 9 is not a prime, so 3797 is not also a term of A085823.
%Y A284060 Cf. A020994, A024770, A024785, A077390, A085823 (a subsequence).
