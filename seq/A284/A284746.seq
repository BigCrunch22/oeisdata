%N A284746 Positions of 0 in A284745; complement of A191263.
%C A284746 Conjecture: a(n)/n -> (5 + sqrt(13))/6.
%C A284746 From _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Apr 13 2017: The conjecture is true since it states that the fraction of 0's is equal to 6/(5 + sqrt(13)), which is the invariant value of the fraction of 0's under the morphism.
