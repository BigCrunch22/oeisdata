%N A284515 "Inside numbers". Pick a term "t" and one of its digits "d". Now jump to the right over d digits if "d" is odd, and to the left over d digits if "d" is even. Whatever the "d" you choose, you will stay on "t".
%C A284515 The sequence is started with a(1) = 100 and always extended with the smallest integer not yet present and not leading to a contradiction.

%e A284515 Pick the digit "1" of the first term, 100. This "1" says that you should jump over 1 digit to the right (as "1" is odd). You'll land on the second "0" of 100.
%e A284515 Pick the leftmost digit "0" of the same term, 100. This "0" says that you should jump over 0 digit to the left (as "0" is even). You slide (land) on the "1" of 100.
%e A284515 Pick the rightmost digit "0" of 100. This "0" says that you should jump over 0 digit to the left (as "0" is even). You slide (land) on the first "0" of 100.
%e A284515 We see that any of those possible three movements leaves you "inside" the chosen term "t".
%Y A284515 Cf. A284591 (full inside numbers).
