%N A284967 Even numbers n such that for every prime p for which n-p is also prime, the number n + (odd part of p-1) is composite.
%C A284967 Terms 0 and 2 formally satisfy the definition.
%C A284967 The definition is similar to A284919, where the condition "n+p is composite" is replaced by "n+odd part of p-1 is composite".
%C A284967 If there is a(6), it is more than 300000. - _Peter J. C. Moses_, Apr 15 2017
%e A284967 For n=76 the suitable primes p are 3, 5, 17, 23, 53, 59, 71, 73; 76 is not in the sequence since only for p=53 n+odd part of (53-1) = 76 + 13 = 89 is prime.
%e A284967 For n=118 the suitable primes p are 5, 11, 17, 29, 47, 59, 71, 89, 101, 107, 113; 118 is a member since all numbers 118+odd part of (p-1) for these primes p are composite.
