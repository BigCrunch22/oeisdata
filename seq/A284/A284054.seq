%N A284054 Relative of Hofstadter Q-sequence.
%C A284054 This sequence is defined by a(n) = 0 for n <= 0; a(1) = 7, a(2) = 26, a(3) = 8, a(4) = 8, a(5) = 8, a(6) = 8, a(7) = 8, a(8) = 26, a(9) = 7, a(10) = 8, a(11) = 16, a(12) = 16, a(13) = 16, a(14) = 16, a(15) = 16, a(16) = 26; thereafter a(n) = a(n-a(n-1)) + a(n-a(n-2)).
%C A284054 Similar to Hofstadter's Q-sequence A005185 but with different starting values.
%C A284054 Much like the Hofstadter Q-sequence A005185, it is not known if this sequence is defined for all positive n.
%C A284054 This sequence has a similar structure to A272160. That sequence consists of five interleaved sequences: four chaotic sequences and a sequence of all 4's. This sequence appears to consist eventually of eight interleaved sequences: four chaotic sequences, a sequence of all 7's, a sequence of mostly 32's and an few 40's, a sequence of all 24's, and a rapidly growing sequence with successive terms satisfying either the recurrence A(k) = A(k-3) + A(k-4) or the recurrence A(k) = A(k-3) + A(k-5).
%C A284054 If the 26's in the initial condition are each replaced by larger numbers, the general structure of this sequence does not change.
