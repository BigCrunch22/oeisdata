%N A284391 1-limiting word of the morphism 0 -> 1, 1 -> 001.
%C A284391 The morphism 0 -> 1, 1 -> 001 has two limiting words. If the number of iterations is even, the 0-word evolves from 0 -> 1 -> 001 -> 11001 -> 00100111001; if the number of iterations is odd, the 1-word evolves from 0 -> 1 -> 001 -> 11001 -> 00100111001 -> 110011100100100111001, as in A284391. The 0-limiting word results from the 1 limiting word by replacing the initial 00 by 1.
%C A284391 Conjecture: the limiting frequency of 0's in both limiting words is 1/2.
