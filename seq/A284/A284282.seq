%N A284282 a(n) = the number k such that A030067(2k-1) = n, or 0 if n does not occur in the semi-Fibonacci sequence A030067.
%C A284282 Otherwise said, a(n) = round(m/2) = (m+1)/2, where m is the smallest index such that A030067(m) = n.
%C A284282 Any integer n which occurs in A030067 first occurs as an odd-indexed term A030067(2k-1) = A030068(k-1), and thereafter at indices (2k-1)*2^j, j=1,2,3,... (Both of these statements follow immediately from the definition of even-indexed terms of A030067.)
%C A284282 It is easy to see that no n can occur a second time as an odd-indexed term in A030067. This follows from the definition of these terms A030067(2k+1) = A030067(2k-1) + A030067(k), which shows that the subsequence of odd-indexed terms (A030068) is strictly increasing, and therefore equal to the range (or: set) of all semi-Fibonacci numbers.
%C A284282 Setting all nonzero terms to 1, this sequence is the characteristic function of A030068 (up to the offset).
