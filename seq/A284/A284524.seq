%N A284524 0-limiting word of the morphism 0->1, 1->0010.
%C A284524 The morphism 0->1, 1-> 0010 has two limiting words. If the number of iterations is even, the 0-word evolves from 0 -> 1 -> 0010 -> 1100101 -> 0010001011001010010; if the number of iterations is odd, the 1-word evolves from 0 -> 1 -> 0010 -> 1100101 ->, as in A284527.
