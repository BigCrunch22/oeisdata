%N A284757 Number of solutions to Nickerson variant of quadruples version of Langford (or Langford-Skolem) problem.
%C A284757 How many ways are of arranging the numbers 1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,...,n,n,n,n so that there are zero numbers between the first and second 1's, between the second and third 1's and between the third and fourth 1's; one number between the first and second 2's, between the second and third 2's and between the third and fourth 2's; ... n-1 numbers between the first and second n's, between the second and third n's and between the third and fourth n's?
%C A284757 An equivalent definition is A261517 with added condition that all different common intervals are <= n.
%C A284757 a(n) ignores reflected solutions.
%C A284757 If n(n - 1) <> 0 (mod 4) then no solutions are possible and a(n) = 0.
