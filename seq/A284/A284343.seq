%N A284343 Number of ways to write n as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers and y <= z such that 2*x + y - z is either zero or a power of 8 (including 8^0 = 1).
%C A284343 Conjecture: (i) For any c = 1,2,4, each n = 0,1,2,... can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers and y <= z such that c*(2*x+y-z) is either zero or a power of eight (including 8^0 = 1).
%C A284343 (ii) Each n = 0,1,2,... can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers such that P(x,y,z,w) is either zero or a power of four (including 4^0 = 1), whenever P(x,y,z,w) is among the polynomials 2*x-y, x+y-z, x-y-z, x+y-2*z, 2*x+y-z, 2*x-y-z, 2*x-2*y-z, x+2*y-3*z, 2*x+2*y-2*z, 2*x+2*y-4*z, 3*x-2*y-z, x+3*y-3*z, 2*x+3*y-3*z, 4*x+2*y-2*z, 8*x+2*y-2*z, 2*(x-y)+z-w, 4*(x-y)+2*(z-w).
%C A284343 Part (i) of the conjecture is stronger than the first part of Conjecture 4.4 in the linked JNT paper (see also A273432).
%C A284343 Modifying the proofs of Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2(i) in the linked JNT paper slightly, we see that for any a = 1,4 and m = 4,5,6 we can write each n = 0,1,2,... as a*x^m + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers such that x is either zero or a power of two (including 2^0 = 1), and that for any b = 1,2 each n = 0,1,2,... can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers such that b*(x-y) is either zero or a power of 4 (including 4^0 = 1).
