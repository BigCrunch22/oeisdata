%N A284793 Difference sequence of A284775.
%C A284793 From _Michel Dekking_, Oct 16 2019: (Start)
%C A284793 This is a morphic sequence, i.e., the letter-to-letter image of a fixed point of a morphism. The way to find this morphism is to compute the 2-block substitution induced by the defining morphism
%C A284793     sigma: 0->01, 1->0011.
%C A284793 If we code the 2-blocks by A:=00, B:=01, C:=10, D:=11, the 2-block morphism tau is given by
%C A284793     A -> BC,  B->BC,  C->ABDC,  D->ABDC.
%C A284793 The fixed point of tau is x = BCABDCBC.... The letter-to letter map is
%C A284793     A->0, B->1, C->-1, D->0.
%C A284793 With a little more work can show that (a(n)) is even an automatic sequence, using that A284775 is automatic.
%C A284793 The generating morphism for A284775 is the uniform length morphism mu given by
%C A284793     a -> abc, b -> deb,c -> aba, d -> bcd, e -> ebc.
%C A284793 The 2-block substitution of this morphism is a morphism on an alphabet of 6 letters, corresponding to the words ab, bc, cd, de, ba  and eb occurring in the fixed point of mu. One can merge the 2 letters corresponding to bc and ba, and then obtains modulo a coding the morphism mu again.
%C A284793 So (a(n)) is the fixed point of mu starting with the letter a, followed  by the letter-to-letter map
%C A284793      a->1, b->-1, c->0, d->1, e->0.
