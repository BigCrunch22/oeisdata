%N A284053 Relative of Hofstadter Q-sequence.
%C A284053 This sequence is defined by a(n) = 0 for n <= 0; a(1) = 9, a(2) = 20, a(3) = 5, a(4) = 5, a(5) = 20, a(6) = 9, a(7) = 20, a(8) = 5, a(9) = 5, a(10) = 20, a(11) = 9, a(12) = 5, a(13) = 10, a(14) = 10, a(15) = 20; thereafter a(n) = a(n-a(n-1)) + a(n-a(n-2)).
%C A284053 Similar to Hofstadter's Q-sequence A005185 but with different starting values.
%C A284053 Much like the Hofstadter Q-sequence A005185, it is not known if this sequence is defined for all positive n.
%C A284053 This sequence has a similar structure to A272610. That sequence consists of five interleaved sequences: four chaotic sequences and a sequence of all 4's. This sequence also consists of five interleaved sequences: four chaotic sequences and a sequence of all 9's.
%C A284053 If the 20's in the initial condition are each replaced by larger numbers, the general structure of this sequence does not change.
