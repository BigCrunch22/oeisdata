%N A284954 0-limiting word of the morphism 0->10, 1-> 000.
%C A284954 The morphism 0->10, 1->000 has two limiting words.  If the number of iterations is even, the 0-word evolves from 0 -> 10 -> 00010 -> 10101000010 -> 00010000100001010101000010; if the number of iterations is odd, the 1-word evolves from 0 -> 10 -> 00010 -> 10101000010, as in A284957.
