%N A284475 Total number of parts in all partitions of n into equal parts, minus the total number of parts in all partitions of n into consecutive parts.
%C A284475 Observation: at least for the first 78 terms of this sequence the values of n where a(n) = n - 2 coincide with the odd numbers of A082664.
%F A284475 Conjecture: a(n) = A000203(n) - A204217(n).
%F A284475 a(2^k) = A000918(k+1), k>=0.
%e A284475 For n = 10 the partitions of 10 into equal parts are [10], [5, 5], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2] and [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. The total number of parts is 18. On the other hand, the partitions of 10 into consecutive parts are [10] and [4, 3, 2, 1]. The total number of parts is 5, so a(10) = 18 - 5 = 13.
%Y A284475 Cf. A000203, A000918, A082647, A082664, A204217, A285914.
