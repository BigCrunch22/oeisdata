%N A284168 Integers n such that sigma(binomial(n,k)) = sigma(binomial(n-1,k-1)) + sigma(binomial(n-1,k)) for some k.
%C A284168 Consider the triangle formed by replacing each m in Pascal's triangle with sigma(m). Then this sequence consists of the row indices where there is a term that is equal to the sum of its NW and N neighbors as in a Pascal triangle.
%e A284168 Here is the triangle also described in A074801.
%e A284168 1,
%e A284168 1, 1,
%e A284168 1, 3, 1,
%e A284168 1, 4, 4, 1,
%e A284168 1, 7, 12, 7, 1,
%e A284168 1, 6, 18, 18, 6, 1,
%e A284168 On row index 3, we have 4 which is the sum of 1 and 3 its NW and N neighbors.
%e A284168 So a(1)= 3, and its column index is 1 which will be corresponding value in A284169.
%o A284168 (PARI) T(n, k) = sigma(binomial(n, k));
%o A284168 isokT(n, k) = T(n-1, k-1) + T (n-1, k) == T(n, k);
%o A284168 isokn(n) = for (k=1, n-1, if (isokT(n,k), return(1)));
