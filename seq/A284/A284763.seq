%N A284763 Numbers n such that A279513(n) is squarefree.
%C A284763 Also numbers with no duplicate prime number in their prime tower factorization (see A182318 for the definition of the prime tower factorization of a number).
%C A284763 This sequence contains the squarefree numbers (A005117); 8 = 2^3 is the first term in this sequence that is not squarefree.
%C A284763 All terms belong to A144146; 81 = 3^2^2 is the first term of A144146 that is not in this sequence.
