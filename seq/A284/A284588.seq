%N A284588 1-limiting word of the morphism 0->1, 1->0101.
%C A284588 The morphism 0->1, 1-> 0101 has two limiting words. If the number of iterations is even, the 0-word evolves from 0 -> 1 -> 0101 -> 1010110101 -> 0101101011010101011010110101; if the number of iterations is odd, the 1-word evolves from 0 -> 1 -> 0101 -> 1010110101, as in A284588.
