%N A284591 "Full Inside numbers". Such numbers have the property that all their digits will be visited exactly once in a single closed circuit (see Comments).
%C A284591 The sequence is started with a(1) = 100 and always extended with the smallest integer not yet present and not leading to a contradiction. See A284515 for the definition of an "Inside number". Listed in the b-file are the 544 first "Full Inside numbers".

%e A284591 The 13th term of the sequence is 1332004. This integer is in the sequence because starting on the first digit "1", will lead to the second "3" (after jumping over exactly one digit to the right), then to "4" (after jumping exactly over three digits to the right), then to the first "3" (after jumping exactly over four digits to the left), then to the last "0" (after jumping exactly over three digits to the right), then to the first "0" (after jumping exactly over no digit to the left, which is equivalent to "sliding" to the digit on the left), then to "2" (same reason), then to the initial "1" (after jumping exactly over two digits to the left. The cycle has come to its end. (The direction -left or right- of a jump is given by the parity -odd or even- of the digit involved.)
