%N A284721 Smallest odd prime that is relatively prime to 2n+1.
%C A284721 More than the usual number of terms are shown in order to distinguish this from A239278.
%C A284721 a(n) = smallest odd prime missing from rad(2*n+1).
%C A284721 If rad(2m+1) = rad(2n+1), a(m) = a(n) (cf. A007947). - _Bob Selcoe_, Apr 04 2017
%F A284721 a(n) = 3 unless n == 1 (mod 3).
%F A284721 For all n >= 2, a(n) < 3*log(2*n+1). Also, for all n >= 1, a(n) <5*log(2*n+1). [Upper bound corrected by _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 15 2017. Thanks to _Bob Selcoe_ for pointing out that the old bound failed at n=1.]
