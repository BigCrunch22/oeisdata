%N A284919 Even integers E such that there is no prime p < E with E - p and E + p both prime.
%C A284919 Or, even integers k such that k + p is composite for all primes p, q with p + q = k.
%C A284919 The two initial terms vacuously satisfy the definition, but all even numbers >= 4 are the sum of two primes, according to the Goldbach conjecture.
%C A284919 All odd numbers except for numbers m such that m-2 and m+2 are prime (= A087679) would satisfy the definition. - _M. F. Hasler_, Apr 05 2017
%C A284919 Conjecture: except for a(4)=6, all terms are coprime to 3. - _Bob Selcoe_, Apr 06 2017
%C A284919 If E is an even number not divisible by 3, then E is in the sequence unless E-3 and at least one of E+3 and 2E-3 are prime. - _Robert Israel_, Apr 10 2017
%C A284919 Consider a subsequence with the additional condition: n+odd part of p-1 is composite (for example, for p=19 it is 9). I found that this subsequence begins 0,2,118 and up to 300000 _Peter J. C. Moses_ found only more one term 868. Is this subsequence finite? - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Apr 12 2017
%C A284919 One can compare the theoretical maxima with the actual sequence numbers of terms.  Doing this at powers of 10, we see at powers {2,3,4,5,6} the ratio progression {2.33, 1.51, 1.25, 1.15, 1.096}.  This implies that the excluded even numbers become increasingly rare (those coprime to 3). - _Bill McEachen_, Apr 17 2017
%C A284919 From Robert Israel's comment and the distribution of primes, the proportion of even numbers not divisible by 3 that are in the sequence tends to 1. - _Peter Munn_, Apr 23 2017
%C A284919 Moreover, If n is not divisible by 3 and 2*n - 3 is composite, then 2*n+p is also composite. Indeed, for these 2*n all primes p such that 2*n-p is prime are in the interval (3, 2*n-3). Then either 2*n-p or 2*n+p should be divisible by 3, but 2*n-p is a prime > 3. So 2*n+p is composite and 2*n is in the sequence. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Apr 28 2017

%e A284919 k=28 is in the sequence because 5+23 = 28 and 11+17 = 28, and 28 + {5,11,17,23} are composite; k=26 is not in the sequence because 3+23 = 26, 7+19 = 26 and 13+13 = 26, but 26+3 = 29 (prime).  - _Bob Selcoe_, Apr 06 2017
