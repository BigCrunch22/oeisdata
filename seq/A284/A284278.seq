%N A284278 a(1)=2; for n >= 1, if n+2 is prime then a(2*n+1) = 3*n + 2 and a(2*n) = n + 2, otherwise all terms are 2.
%C A284278 The sequence is motivated by A284172, by the message from B. Jubin dated Mar 23 2017 and by the classic open problem of showing that there are infinitely many primes p for which 2*p-1 is also prime. If there were only finitely many such primes, then there would be a place where this sequence is generated by the same rule as A284172.
%C A284278 The sequence of the first differences begins 1, 2, -1, -2, 3, 4, -3, -4, 5, 6, -5, -6, 7, -7, 8, -8, 9, 10, -9, -10, 11, 12, -11, -12, 13, -13, 14, -14, 15, 16, -15, -16, 17, 18, ...
%C A284278 From the definition it easily follows that, for a positive x, the sequence contains roughly equal numbers of prime and composite terms <= x.
%C A284278 A conditional property: if there is a maximal prime P such that 2*P-1 is also prime, then for n > P, every pair (a(2*n), a(2*n+1)) contains one prime and one composite. Indeed, if n+2 is prime, then a(2*n) = n + 2 is prime, while a(2*n+1) = 2*n + 3 = 2*(n+2) - 1 is composite; if n+2 is composite, then a(2*n) = n + 2 is composite, while a(2*n+1) = 2 is prime. - _Vladimir Shevelev_, Mar 26 2017

%e A284278 For n=19, a(38) = a(2*19) = 19+2 = 21, a(39) = a(2*19+1) = 2, the latter since 19+2 is not prime;
%e A284278 for n=21, a(42) = a(2*21) = 21+2 = 23, a(43) = a(2*21+1) = 2*21+3 = 45 since 21+2 is prime.
