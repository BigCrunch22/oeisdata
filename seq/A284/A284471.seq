%N A284471 1-limiting word of the morphism 0->1, 1->0100.
%C A284471 The morphism 0->1, 1->0100 has two limiting words.  If the number of iterations is even, the 0-word evolves from 0 -> 1 -> 0100 -> 1010011 -> 0100101001101000100; if the number of iterations is odd, the 1-word evolves from 0 -> 1 -> 0100 -> 1010011 -> 0100101001101000100, 1010011010010100110100010010100111010011, as in A284471.
