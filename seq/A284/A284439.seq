%N A284439 Sum the last digit of a(n) and the first digit of a(n+1); keep only the leftmost digit of the result. The succession of those "leftmost digits" is the succession of the digits of the sequence itself.
%C A284439 The sequence is started with a(1) a= 1 and always extended with the smallest integer not yet present and not leading to a contradiction. There are no "0" digits in the sequence as a this 0 would be the leftmost digit of a later sum -- which is impossible.
%C A284439 Is this a permutation of the list (A052382) of numbers with no zero digits? - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Mar 27 2017

%e A284439 The 1st sum is 1+9, with result 10, and leftmost digit 1;
%e A284439 The 2nd sum is 1+8, with result 9, and leftmost digit 9;
%e A284439 The 3rd sum is 8+2, with result 10, and leftmost digit 1;
%e A284439 The 4th sum is 2+6, with result 8, and leftmost digit 8;
%e A284439 The 5th sum is 1+1, with result 2, and leftmost digit 2;
%e A284439 The 6th sum is 1+5, with result 6, and leftmost digit 6, etc.
%e A284439 The 6 "leftmost digits" so far are [1,9,1,8,2,6]; those are precisely the first 6 digits of the sequence.
