%N A284388 0-limiting word of the morphism 0 -> 1, 1 -> 001.
%C A284388 The morphism 0 -> 1, 1 -> 001 has two limiting words. If the number of iterations is even, the 0-word evolves from 0 -> 1 -> 001 -> 11001 -> 00100111001; if the number of iterations is odd, the 1-word evolves from 0 -> 1 -> 001 -> 11001 -> 00100111001 -> 110011100100100111001, as in A284391. The 0-limiting word results from the 1 limiting word by replacing the initial 00 by 1.
%C A284388 Conjecture: the limiting frequency of 0's in both limiting words is 1/2.
%C A284388 Conjecture: after the first term, same as one less than the run-lengths of the Thue-Morse sequence A010060. - _George Beck_, Mar 24 2021
%C A284388 From _Adnan Baysal_, Aug 06 2023: (Start)
%C A284388 Conjecture: Excluding the first two terms, if runs of 1s of length one are replaced by 0, and runs of 1s of length three are replaced by 1, we get the same sequence.
%C A284388 Conjecture: Index distance between two consecutive 1s is either one or three. Excluding the first two terms, if distances of one are replaced by 0, and distances of three are replaced by 1, we get the same sequence. (End)
