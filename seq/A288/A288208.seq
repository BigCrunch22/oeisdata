%N A288208 The number of permutations of a sequence of length n such that there are no fixed points, and no term is next to a term it was next to originally.
%C A288208 a(n) is bounded above both by A002464 and A000166.
%C A288208 The Mathematics Stack Exchange link claims that the limit as n goes to infinity of A000166(n)/a(n) = e^2.
%H A288208 Mathematics Stack Exchange, <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2309850">If some series of n terms is deranged, what is the probability that no term stands next to a term it was next to originally?</a>
%e A288208 For n = 4 the a(4) = 2 solutions are [2,4,1,3] and [3,1,4,2].
%e A288208 For n = 5 the a(5) = 2 solutions are [3,1,5,2,4] and [2,4,1,5,3].

%Y A288208 Cf. A002464 is analogous without the fixed point restriction.
