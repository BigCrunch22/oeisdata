%N A288577 Image of 0 under repeated application of the morphism phi = {x -> x,x+1,x+2 if x mod 3 = 0; x -> x+1 if x mod 3 = 1 or 2, for x = 0,1,2,3,...}.
%C A288577 An analog of A104324 when "Fibonacci" is replaced with "tribonacci".
%C A288577 From _Kerry Mitchell_, Jul 01 2017: (Start)
%C A288577 This is the limit of a series of iterations. The length of each iteration is given by A000213, beginning with the second term of that sequence (1, 3, 5, 9, 17, etc.):
%C A288577 0
%C A288577 0, 1, 2
%C A288577 0, 1, 2, 2, 3
%C A288577 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5
%C A288577 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6
%C A288577 etc.
%C A288577 When written in blocks this way, each subsequent block is the concatenation of the previous block, the third-previous block with each term incremented by 3, and the second-previous block, with each term incremented by 3. (End)
