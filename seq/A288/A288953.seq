%N A288953 Number of relaxed compacted binary trees of right height at most one with minimal sequences between branch nodes except after the last branch node on level 0.
%C A288953 A relaxed compacted binary tree of size n is a directed acyclic graph consisting of a binary tree with n internal nodes, one leaf, and n pointers. It is constructed from a binary tree of size n, where the first leaf in a post-order traversal is kept and all other leaves are replaced by pointers. These links may point to any node that has already been visited by the post-order traversal. The right height is the maximal number of right-edges (or right children) on all paths from the root to any leaf after deleting all pointers. A branch node is a node with a left and right edge (no pointer). See the Genitrini et al. link. - _Michael Wallner_, Apr 20 2017
%C A288953 a(n) is the number of plane increasing trees with n+1 nodes where in the growth process induced by the labels maximal young leaves and non-maximal young leaves alternate except for a sequence of maximal young leaves at the beginning. A young leaf is a leaf with no left sibling. A maximal young leaf is a young leaf with maximal label. See the Wallner link. - _Michael Wallner_, Apr 20 2017

%e A288953 Denote by L the leaf and by o nodes. Every node has exactly two out-going edges or pointers. Internal edges are denoted by - or |. Pointers are omitted and may point to any node further right. The root is at level 0 at the very left.
