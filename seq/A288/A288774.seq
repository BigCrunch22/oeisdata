%N A288774 a(n) is the largest positive integers whose partitions into consecutive parts can be totally represented in the first n rows of the table described in A286000.
%C A288774 a(n) has the same definition related to the table A286001 which is another version of the table A286000.
%C A288774 First differs from A288773 at a(12), which shares infinitely many terms.
%e A288774 Figures A, B, C show the evolution of the table of partitions into consecutive parts described in A286000, with 11, 12 and 13 rows respectively:
