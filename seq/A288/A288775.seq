%N A288775 Difference between the total number of toothpicks in the toothpick structure of A139250 that are parallel to the initial toothpick after n odd stages, and the total number of "ON" cells at n-th stage in the "Ulam-Warburton" two-dimensional cellular automaton of A147562.
%C A288775 It appears that a(n) = 0 if and only if n is a member of A048645.
%C A288775 First differs from A255263 at a(14), with which it shares infinitely many terms.
%C A288775 It appears that A147562(n) = A162795(n) = A169707(n) = A255366(n) = A256250(n) = A256260(n), if n is a member of A048645.
