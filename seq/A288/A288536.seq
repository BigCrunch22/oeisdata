%N A288536 The eventual period of the RATS sequence in base n starting from 1; 0 is for infinity.
%C A288536 Eventual period of 1 under the mapping x->A288535(n,x), or 0 if there is a divergence and thus no eventual period.
%C A288536 Column 1 of A288537.
%C A288536 In Thiel's terms, the zeroes a(10), a(19), and a(37) correspond to quasiperiodic divergent RATS sequences with quasiperiod 2, while a(50)=0 corresponds to a sequence with quasiperiod 3.

%e A288536 In base 3, the RATS mapping acts as 1 -> 2 -> 4 (11 in base 3) -> 8 (22 in base 3) -> 13 (112 in base 3) -> 4, which has already been seen 3 steps ago, so a(3)=3.
