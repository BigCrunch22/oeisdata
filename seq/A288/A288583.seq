%C A288583 From _Bernd Mulansky_, Jun 23 2021: (Start)
%C A288583 Additive bases: a(n) is the least integer k such that in each cyclic group Z_j with j>=k there is a subset of n elements all pairs (of distinct elements) of which add up to a different sum (in Z_j).
%C A288583 Such subsets are known as (modular) weak Sidon sets, weak B_2 sets, or well-spread sequences.

%e A288583 Z_j contains a weak Sidon set of size 8 for j=40 and for every j>=42, but not for j=41, hence a(8)=42.
