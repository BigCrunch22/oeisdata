%N A288351 Number of strings of n digits from 1...9 such that no formula using the single digits in the given order exists that evaluates to 0.
%C A288351 For definitions and comments see A288350.
%C A288351 It is conjectured that a(n)=0 for n>=8.
%C A288351 The conjecture is true, as shown in the corresponding comment in A288350. - _Hugo Pfoertner_, Jun 09 2017
%e A288351 a(1)=9 because 1...9 /=0. a(2)=72, because only the 9 numbers 11, 22, ..., 99 of the 81 two-digit strings can represent 0.
