%N A288711 1-limiting word of the mapping 00->1000, 10->00, starting with 00.
%C A288711 Iterates of the mapping, starting with 00:
%C A288711 00
%C A288711 1000
%C A288711 001000
%C A288711 1000001000

%C A288711 001000100000100010000010000010001000001000
%C A288711 The 1-limiting word is the limit of the n-th iterates for n == 1 mod 2.
%C A288711 The number of letters (0's and 1's) in the n-th iterate is given by 2*F(n+2) for n >= 0, where F = A000045 (Fibonacci numbers), as follows from the observation that this sequence is the {0->00, 1->10}-transform of the mapping 0->10, 1->0; see the Example section.

%e A288711 The first three n-th iterates for n == 1 (mod 3) are
%e A288711 1000

%e A288711 10000010000010001000001000
%e A288711 Regarding the connection to Fibonacci numbers mentioned in Comments, iterates of the morphism 0->10, 1->0, starting with 0th iterate 0, are
%e A288711 0
%e A288711 10
%e A288711 010
%e A288711 10010
%e A288711 01010010
%e A288711 1001001010010
%e A288711 where the length of the n-th iterate is F(n+2). The {0->00, 1->10}-transform of the iterates is then 00, 1000, 001000, ..., as indicated in Comments.
