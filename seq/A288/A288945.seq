%N A288945 Starting with a(1) = 1, a(n) = smallest nonnegative integer not yet in the sequence such that the first digit of a(n) is the last digit of a(n-1) plus or minus 1, with preference given to -1 when possible. The digit 0 is not allowed.
%C A288945 If a(n-1) ends in 1, a(n) must begin with 2 (i.e., a forced increase by 1).
%C A288945 There are no numbers in the sequence with first digit 9.
%e A288945 11 is followed by 21 in the sequence since it can't be followed by a number starting with 0.
