%N A288118 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms such that, for any i and j > 0, a(i*j) != a(i) * a(j).
%C A288118 If we drop the unicity constraint, then we obtain the Liouville's function (A007421).
%C A288118 This sequence is a permutation of the natural numbers (we can always choose the least value not yet seen at prime positions).
%C A288118 Conjecturally:
%C A288118 - the sequence is self-inverse,
%C A288118 - | a(n) - n | <= 1 for any n > 0,
%C A288118 - | a(i)*a(j) - i*j | <> 1 for any i > 0 and j > 0,
%C A288118 - a(n) = n+1 iff a(n+1) = n.
%C A288118 a(6) = a(1) * a(2) * a(3).
%C A288118 This sequence has connections with A288119; here we avoid a(i)*a(j) = a(i*j), there a(i)+a(j) = a(i*j).

%e A288118 a(1) cannot equal 1 as a(1*1) != a(1)*a(1); a(1) = 2 is acceptable.
%e A288118 a(2) cannot equal a(1); a(2) = 1 is acceptable.
%e A288118 a(3) cannot equal a(1), a(2); a(3) = 3 is acceptable.
%e A288118 a(4) cannot equal a(1)...a(3), a(2)^2; a(4) = 5 is acceptable.
%e A288118 a(5) cannot equal a(1)...a(4); a(5) = 4 is acceptable.
%e A288118 a(6) cannot equal a(1)...a(5), a(2)*a(3); a(6) = 6 is acceptable.
