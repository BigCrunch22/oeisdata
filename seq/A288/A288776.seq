%N A288776 Theta series of the 24-dimensional lattice of hyper-roots E_5(SU(3))
%C A288776 This lattice is associated with the exceptional module-category E_5(SU(3)) over the fusion (monoidal) category A_5(SU(3)).
%C A288776 The Grothendieck group of the former, a finite abelian category, is a Z+ - module over the Grothendieck ring of the latter, with a basis given by isomorphism classes of simple objects.
%C A288776 Simple objects of A_k(SU(3)) are irreducible integrable representations of the affine Lie algebra of SU(3) at level k.
%C A288776 The classification of module-categories over A_k(SU(3)) was done, using another terminology, by P. Di Francesco and J.-B Zuber, and by A. Ocneanu (see refs below): it contains several infinite families that exist for all values of the positive integer k (among others one finds the A_k(SU(3)) themselves and the orbifold series D_k(SU(3))), and several exceptional cases for special values of k.
%C A288776 To every such module-category one can associate a set of hyper-roots (see refs below) and consider the corresponding lattice, denoted by the same symbol.
%C A288776 E_k(SU(3)), with k=5, is one of the exceptional cases; other exceptional cases exist for k=9 and k=21. It is also special because it has self-fusion (it is flat, in operator algebra parlance).
%C A288776 E_5(SU(3)) has r=12 simple objects. The rank of the lattice is 2r=24. Det =2^30. This lattice, with k=5, is defined by 2 * r * (k+3)^2/3=512 hyper-roots of norm 6. They are also the vectors of shortest length (so, vectors of shortest length and hyper-roots coincide, like for lattices of type A_k(SU(3))). Minimal norm is 6.
%C A288776 The lattice is rescaled (q --> q^2): its theta function starts as 1 + 512*q^6 + 11232*q^8 +... See example.
