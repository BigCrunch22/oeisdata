%N A288946 Starting with a(1) = 1, a(n) = smallest nonnegative integer not yet in the sequence such that the first digit of a(n) is plus or minus one the last digit of a(n-1) plus or minus 1, with preference given +1 when possible. The digit 0 is not allowed.
%C A288946 If a(n-1) ends in 9, a(n) must begin with 8 (i.e., a forced decrease by 1).
%e A288946 9 is followed by 81 in the sequence since there is no larger digit and 8 has already been used.
