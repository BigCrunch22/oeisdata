%N A288537 Array A(b,n) by upward antidiagonals (b>1, n>0): the eventual period of the RATS sequence in base b starting from n; 0 is for infinity.
%C A288537 Eventual period of n under the mapping x->A288535(b,x), or 0 if there is a divergence and thus no eventual period.
%C A288537 For b = 3*2^m - 2 with m>1, row b contains all sufficiently large even integers if m is odd, or just all sufficiently large integers if m is even.
%C A288537 For b = 1 or 10 (mod 18) or b = 1 (mod (2^q-1)^2) with q>2, there are 0's in row b.
%C A288537 Conway conjectured that in row (base) 10, all 0's correspond to the same divergent RATS sequence called the Creeper (A164338). In Thiel's terms, it is quasiperiodic with quasiperiod 2, i.e., after every 2 steps the number of one of the digits (in this case, 3 or 6) increases by 1 while other digits stay unchanged. In other bases, 0's may correspond to different divergent RATS sequences. Thiel conjectured that the divergent RATS sequences are always quasiperiodic.

%e A288537 In base 3, the RATS mapping acts as 1 -> 2 -> 4 (11 in base 3) -> 8 (22 in base 3) -> 13 (112 in base 3) -> 4, which has already been seen 3 steps ago, so A(3,1)=3.
