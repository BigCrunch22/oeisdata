%N A288760 Number of distinct nonnegative rational numbers that can be obtained in n steps by applying addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to any two potentially identical numbers from the complete set of numbers created in n-1 steps, starting with the set {1}.
%C A288760 The conjectured value of a(6)=451572162 needs independent verification.
%C A288760 For an explanation of the difference from a straight-line program (SLP) see comment in A288759. A288850 provides the corresponding cardinalities of the sets that can be obtained by an n-step SLP.
