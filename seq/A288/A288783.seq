%N A288783 Brazilian numbers which have only one Brazilian representation.
%C A288783 These numbers could be called 1-Brazilian numbers.
%C A288783 The smallest number of this sequence is 7 = 111_2 which is also the smallest Brazilian number (A125134) and the smallest Brazilian prime (A085104), and as such belongs to A329383.
%C A288783 a(2) = 8 is the smallest composite Brazilian number and so the smallest even composite Brazilian with 8 = 22_3 (A220571).
%C A288783 a(10) = 27 is the smallest odd composite Brazilian in this sequence because 27 = 33_8 but 15 is the smallest odd composite Brazilian with 15 = 1111_2 = 33_4 so with two representations.
%C A288783 121 is the only square of prime which is Brazilian with 121 = 11111_3.
%C A288783 In this sequence, there are:
%C A288783 1) The Brazilian primes (except for 31 and 8191) and the only square of prime 121 which are all repunits in a base >= 2 with a string of at least three 1's.
%C A288783 2) The composite numbers which are such that n = a * b = (aa)_(b-1) with 1 < a < b-1 with only one such product a * b.
