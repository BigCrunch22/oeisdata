%N A288909 Theta series of the 48-dimensional lattice of hyper-roots E_21(SU(3)).
%C A288909 This lattice is associated with the exceptional module-category E_21(SU(3)) over the fusion (monoidal) category A_21(SU(3)).
%C A288909 The Grothendieck group of the former, a finite abelian category, is a Z+ - module over the Grothendieck ring of the latter, with a basis given by isomorphism classes of simple objects.
%C A288909 Simple objects of A_k(SU(3)) are irreducible integrable representations of the affine Lie algebra of SU(3) at level k.
%C A288909 The classification of module-categories over A_k(SU(3)) was done, using another terminology, by P. Di Francesco and J.-B Zuber, and by A. Ocneanu (see refs below): it contains several infinite families that exist for all values of the positive integer k (among others one finds the A_k(SU(3)) themselves and the orbifold series D_k(SU(3))), and several exceptional cases for special values of k.
%C A288909 To every such module-category one can associate a set of hyper-roots (see refs below) and consider the corresponding lattice, denoted by the same symbol.
%C A288909 E_k(SU(3)), with k=21, is one of the exceptional cases; other exceptional cases exist for k=5 and k=9. It is also special because it has self-fusion (it is flat, in operator algebra parlance).
%C A288909 E_21(SU(3)) has r=24 simple objects. The rank of the lattice is 2r=48. Det =3^12. This lattice, using k=21, is defined by 2r(k+3)^2/3=9216 hyper-roots of norm 6.
%C A288909 The first shell is made of vectors of norm 4, they are not hyper-roots, and the second shell, of norm 6, contains not only the hyper-roots but other vectors as well. Note: for lattices of type A_k(SU(3)), vectors of shortest length and hyper-roots coincide, here this is not so.
%C A288909 The lattice is rescaled (q --> q^2): its theta function starts as 1 +144*q^4 + 64512*q^6 +... See example.
