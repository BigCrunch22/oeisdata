%N A288530 Triangle read by rows in reverse order: T(n,k), (0 <= k <= n), in which each term is the least nonnegative integer such that no row, column, diagonal, or antidiagonal contains a repeated term.
%C A288530 Note that the n-th row of this triangle is constructed from right to left, starting at the column n and ending at the column 0.
%C A288530 Theorem 1: the middle diagonal gives A000004, the all-zeros sequence.
%C A288530 Theorem 2: all zeros are in the middle diagonal.
%C A288530 For the proofs of the theorems 1 and 2 see the proofs of the theorems 1 and 2 of A274650, because this is essentially the same problem.
%C A288530 Conjecture 3: every column is a permutation of the nonnegative integers.
%C A288530 Conjecture 4: every diagonal is a permutation of the right border which gives the nonnegative integers.

%F A288530 T(n,k) = A288531(n+1, k+1) - 1.
%F A288530 T(n,n) = n.
%e A288530 Note that every row of the triangle is constructed from right to left, so the sequence is 0, 1, 2, 2, 0, 3, ... (see below):
%e A288530 0,
%e A288530 2,   1,
%e A288530 3,   0,  2,

%e A288530 1,   2,  0,  5,  4,                      Every row is constructed

%e A288530 The triangle may be reformatted as an isosceles triangle so that the all-zeros sequence (A000004) appears in the central column (but note that this is NOT the way the triangle is constructed!):
%e A288530 .
%e A288530 .              0,
%e A288530 .            2,  1,
%e A288530 ,          3,  0,  2,
%e A288530 .        5,  4,  1,  3,

%e A288530 .  9,  8,  3,  0,  2,  4,  6,
%e A288530 ...
%e A288530 Also the triangle may be reformatted for reading from left to right:
%e A288530 .
%e A288530 .                           0;
%e A288530 .                       1,  2;
%e A288530 .                   2,  0,  3;
%e A288530 .               3,  1,  4,  5;
%e A288530 .           4,  5,  0 , 2,  1;
%e A288530 .       5,  3,  1,  4,  6,  7;
%e A288530 .   6,  4,  2,  0,  3,  8,  9;
%e A288530 ...
%Y A288530 Middle diagonal gives A000004.
%Y A288530 Right border gives A001477.
%Y A288530 Indices of the zeros are in A046092.
%Y A288530 Cf. A288531 is the same triangle but with 1 added to every entry.
%Y A288530 Other sequences of the same family are A269526, A274528, A274650, A274651, A274820, A274821, A286297.
