%N A288941 a(n) is the least natural number not included earlier having all decimal digits except the digits in n; if n is pandigital or zeroless pandigital, a(n) is simply the least natural number not included earlier.
%C A288941 A rearrangement of the natural numbers by definition as there are an infinite number of pandigital numbers (A171102) and zeroless pandigital numbers (A050289).
%C A288941 Leading zeros are not permitted. The "zeroless pandigital" criterion is used also because there is just one number with the digit 0 only and we wish all terms to be distinct.
%C A288941 What values are a(A050289(1)) = a(123456789) and a(A171102(1)) = a(1023456789)?

%e A288941 For n = 0, a(0) = 123456789, the least natural number containing all decimal digits but the digit 0.
%e A288941 For n = 11, a(11) = 203456798, which has all decimal digits but the digit 1 and is the first such number with that property that is larger than 203456789 (= a(1)).
%Y A288941 Cf. A050289, A171102.
