%N A281291 Numbers n such that 2*n! is not a refactorable number.
%C A281291 See Conjecture 47 and Theorem 51 in Zelinsky's paper for related points.
%C A281291 In Theorem 51 Zelinsky gives a technical result which almost implies that for all sufficiently large n, n! is a refactorable number. (Corrected by _Joshua Zelinsky_, May 15 2020)
%C A281291 Also note that Luca & Young paper gives a proof for n! is a refactorable number for all n > 5.
%C A281291 This sequence focuses on the 2 * n! and we cannot say that 2 * n! is refactorable for all sufficiently large n at the moment. This is because if 2^(2^k) + 1 is a Fermat prime (A019434), then 2^(2^k) is a term of this sequence and it is not known yet sequence of Fermat primes is finite or not.
