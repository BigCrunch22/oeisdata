%N A281008 Least positive integer k with exactly n odd divisors greater than sqrt(2*k).
%C A281008 Conjecture: a(n) is also the smallest number k having n pairs of equidistant subparts in the symmetric representation of sigma(k).
%C A281008 For more information about the "subparts" see A279387.
%C A281008 Observations about the known terms:
%C A281008 Observation 1: terms a(1)-a(51) are divisible by 3.
%C A281008 Observation 2: terms a(3)-a(51) are divisible by 5.

%e A281008 a(3) = 75 because the divisors of 75 are [1, 3, 5, 15, 25, 75], and 75 has three odd divisors greater than the square root of 2*75 = 12.2..., and it is the smallest number with that property.
%e A281008 Other examples (conjectured):
%e A281008 2) The 75th row of A237593 is [38, 13, 7, 4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 7, 13, 38], and the 74th row of the same triangle is [38, 13, 6, 5, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6, 13, 38], therefore between both symmetric Dyck paths (described in A237593 and A279387) there are three pairs of equidistant subparts: [38, 38], [21, 21] and [3, 3]. That is the first row with that property, so a(3) = 75. (The diagram of the symmetric representation of sigma(75) is too large to include).
%e A281008 3) The 75th row of A196020 is [149, 73, 47, 0, 25, 19, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0], hence the 75th row of A280850 is [38, 38, 21, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0, 21, 0]. There are three pairs of equidistant subparts [38, 38], [21, 21] and [3, 3]. That is the first row with that property, so a(3) = 75.
%e A281008 4) The 75th row of A237048 is [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]. The sum of the even-indexed terms is equal to 3. That is the first row with that property, so a(3) = 75.
%e A281008 5) The 75th row of A261699 is [1, 75, 3, 0, 5, 25, 0, 0, 0, 15, 0]. There are three even-indexed terms that are positive integers: [75, 25, 15]. That is the first row with that property, so a(3) = 75.
