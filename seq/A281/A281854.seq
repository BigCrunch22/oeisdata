%N A281854 Irregular triangle read by rows. Row n gives the orders of the cyclic groups appearing as factors in the direct product decomposition of the abelian non-cyclic multiplicative groups of integers modulo A033949(n).
%C A281854 The length of row n is given in A281855.
%C A281854 The multiplicative group of integers modulo n is written as (Z/(n Z))^x (in ring notation, group of units) isomorphic to Gal(Q(zeta(n))/Q) with zeta(n) = exp(2*Pi*I/n). The present table gives in row n the factors of the direct product decomposition of the non-cyclic group of integers modulo A033949(n) (in nonincreasing order). The cyclic group of order n is C_n. Note that only C-factors of prime power orders are used; for example C_6 has the decomposition C_3 x C_2, etc. C_n is decomposed whenever n has relatively prime factors like in C_30 = C_15 x C_2 = C_5 x C_3 x C_2. In the Wikipedia table partial decompositions appear.
%C A281854 The row products phi(A033949(n)) are given as 4*A281856(n), n >= 1, with phi(n) = A000010(n).
%C A281854 See also the W. Lang links for these groups.

The smallest positive reduced system modulo 21 has the primes {2, 5, 11, 13, 17, 19} with cycle lengths {6, 6, 6, 2, 6, 6}, respectively. As generators of the group one can take <2, 13>.

%e A281854 From _Wolfdieter Lang_, Feb 04 2017: (Start)
%e A281854 n = 32, A033949(32) = N = 70, phi(70) = 24.
%e A281854 Cycle types (multiplicity as subscript): 12_7, 6_4, 4_2, 3_1, 2_2 (a total of 16 cycles). Cycle structure: 12_2, 6_2 (all other cycles are sub-cycles).
%e A281854 The first 12-cycle obtained from the powers of, say 3, contains also the 12-cycles from 17 and 47. It also contains the 4-cycle from 13, the 3-cycle from 11 and the 2-cycle from 29.
%e A281854 The second 12-cycle from the powers of, say, 23 contains also the 12-cycles from 37, 53 and 67, as well as the 4-cycle from 43.
%e A281854 The first 6-cycle from the powers of, say, 19 contains also the 6-cycle of 59 as well as the 2-cycle from 41.
%e A281854 The second 6-cycle from the powers of, say, 31 contains also the 6-cycle from 61.
%e A281854 The group is C_6 x C_4 = (C_2 x C_3) x C_4 = C_4 X C_3 x C_2 (see the W. Lang link, Table 7)
%e A281854 The cycle graph of C_4 X C_3 x C_2 is the 7th entry of Figure 4 of this link.
