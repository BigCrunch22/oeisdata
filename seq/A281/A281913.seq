%N A281913 Number of ordered integer pairs (b,c), with -n<=b<=n, -n<=c<=n, such that both roots of 2x^2+bx+c=0 are rational and b and c are not both even.
%C A281913 We are not counting the cases where there is a possible overall factor of 2. When there is an overall factor of 2 we obtain the sequence A067274. These results have been proved and will appear in an upcoming paper.
%e A281913 The four quadratics for a(2)=4 and their roots are as follows:
%e A281913 2*x^2 + 1*x + 0 = x(1 + 2*x);         x =  0, x = -1/2.
%e A281913 2*x^2 + 1*x - 1 = (1 + x)(- 1 + 2*x); x = -1, x = +1/2.
%e A281913 2*x^2 - 1*x + 0 = x(- 1 + 2*x);       x =  0, x = +1/2.
%e A281913 2*x^2 - 1*x - 1 = (- 1+ x)(1 + 2*x);  x = +1, x = -1/2.
%e A281913 There are nine cases where there is an overall factor of 2 which are counted in series A067274.
