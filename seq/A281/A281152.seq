%N A281152 Least number k such that Sum_{j=k..k+n-1}{j} = Sum_{j=k+n..t}{j}, for some t >= k+n.
%C A281152 With n = 5 consecutive numbers we can start from k = 4 but also from k = 16. The sequence considers only the least number: a(5) = 4.

%e A281152 a(2)= 1 because 1+2=3 and 1 is the least number to have this property;
%e A281152 a(3)= 4 because 4+5+6=7+8 and 4 is the least number to have this property;
%e A281152 a(4)= 9 because 9+10+11+12=13+14+15 and 9 is the least number to have this property;
%e A281152 a(5)= 4 because 4+5+6+7+8=9+10+11 and 4 is the least number to have this property.
