%N A281426 Numerator of n-th term of sequence (or tree) S of all rational numbers generated by these rules:  0 is in S; if x is in S then x + 1 is in S, and if x + 1 is nonzero, then -1/(x + 1) is in S; duplicates are deleted as they occur.
%C A281426 See A232890 for the corresponding denominators and additional comments.

%e A281426 To generate S, the number 0 begets (1,-1), whence 1 begets 2 and -1/2, whereas -1 begets 0 and -1/2, both of which are (deleted )duplicates, so that g(3) = (2, -1/2).  The resulting concatenation of all the generations g(n) begins with 0, 1, -1, 2, -1/2, 3, -1/3, 1/2, -2, 4, -1/4, so that A232890 begins with 0, 1, -1, 2, -1, 3, -1, 1, -2, 4.
