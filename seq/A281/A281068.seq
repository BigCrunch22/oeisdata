%N A281068 a(1) = 1. a(n) is the smallest natural number that is not already in the sequence such that the name of a(n) in English starts with the letter a(n-1) ends with, and a(n) makes the sequence extendable.
%C A281068 "a(n) makes the sequence extendable" means the name of a(n) does not end with any of the letters r, x, y and d.
%e A281068 If a(4) were 100 (one hundred, which ends with d), it would make the sequence finite. Therefore, a(4) has to be 101.
