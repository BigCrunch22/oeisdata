%N A281998 a(n) is the smallest prime p such that there is a multiplicative subgroup H of Z/pZ, of even size and of index n, such that for any two cosets H1 and H2 of H, H1 + H2 contains all of (Z/pZ)\0.
%C A281998 It must be that p = a(n) is equivalent to 1 mod 2n.  The fact that H is of even size means H = -H. The finite integral relation algebra with n symmetric flexible diversity atoms is representable over Z/pZ, where p = a(n).
