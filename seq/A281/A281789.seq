%N A281789 Numbers n such that n^3-1 is a sum of cubes in 1 way and a difference of cubes in 2 ways.
%C A281789 By Fermat's Last Theorem, n^3 cannot be the difference nor the sum of 2 positive cubes, but n^3+1 or n^3-1 could be. If n^3-1 is also the sum of positive cubes and the difference of two other positives cubes besides n^3 and 1^3, then n is a term of the sequence. Interestingly, I have not been able to find numbers n such that n^3+1 is a difference of 2 positive cubes in 1 way and the sum of 2 positive cubes in 2 ways.
%C A281789 Conjecture: if a term n is square, then 10000*n is also a term.

%e A281789 3515625 is a term since 3515625^3 - 1 = 140624^3 + 3515550^3 = 3515700^3 - 140626^3.
