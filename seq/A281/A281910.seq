%N A281910 Minimum possible absolute value over all coefficients of p(x)/(1-x)^n, where p is a power series with +-1 coefficients.
%C A281910 It is known that a(7) >= 2124, and that is conjectured to be the true value.
%e A281910 For n = 3 consider p(x) = (x+1)(x-1)^2/(x^4+1). Considered as a power series, this has coefficients +- 1 only. Then p(x)/(1-x)^3 has coefficients bounded by 2 in absolute value.
