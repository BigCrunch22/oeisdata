%N A281009 Number of odd divisors of n minus the number of middle divisors of n.
%C A281009 Conjecture 1: a(n) is also twice the number of odd divisors of n greater than sqrt(2*n).
%C A281009 Conjecture 2: a(n) is also the number of odd divisors of n less than sqrt(2*n) that are not middle divisors of n, plus the number of odd divisors of n greater than sqrt(2*n).
%C A281009 Conjecture 3: a(n) is also the total number of equidistant subparts in the symmetric representation of sigma(n).
%C A281009 The "equidistant subparts" are the subparts that are not the "central subparts".
%C A281009 For more information of the "subparts" see A279387.

%F A281009 a(n) = A001227(n) - A067742(n).
%F A281009 Conjecture: a(n) = 2*A131576(n).
%e A281009 For n = 45 the divisors of 45 are [1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45]. There are 6 odd divisors, and two of them [5 and 9] are also the middle divisors of 45, so a(45) = 6 - 2 = 4.
%e A281009 Other examples (conjectured):
%e A281009 2) There are two odd divisors of 45 that are greater than the square root of 2*45 = 9.4..., so a(45) = 2*2 = 4.
%e A281009 3) The 45th row of A237593 is [23, 8, 5, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 8, 23], and the 44th row of the same triangle is [23, 8, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 23], therefore between both symmetric Dyck paths (described in A237593 and A279387) there are two central subparts [27 and 1] and two pairs of equidistant subparts ([23, 23] and [2, 2]). The total number of equidistant subparts is equal to 4, so a(45) = 4. (the diagram of the symmetric representation of sigma(45) is too large to include).
%e A281009 4) The 45th row of A196020 is [89, 43, 27, 0, 13, 9, 0, 0, 1], hence the 45th row of A280850 is [23, 23, 27, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1]. There are two central subparts [27 and 1] and two pairs of equidistant subparts ([23, 23] and [2, 2]). The total number of equidistant subparts is equal to 4, so a(45) = 4.
