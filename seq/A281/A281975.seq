%C A281975 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n = 0,1,2,....
%C A281975 (ii) Each nonnegative integer n can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers such that |x-y| and 2*(y-z) (or 2*(z-y)) are both squares.
%C A281975 (iii) For each ordered pair (a,b) = (2,1), (3,1), (9,5), (14,10), any nonnegative integer n can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers such that x and |a*x-b*y| are both squares.
%C A281975 The author has proved that each n = 0,1,2,... can be written as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + w^2 with x,y,z,w nonnegative integers such that x (or x-y, or 2(x-y)) is a square.
