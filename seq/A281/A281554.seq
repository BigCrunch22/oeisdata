%N A281554 Number of nonassociative right conjugacy closed loops of order n up to isomorphism.
%C A281554 For a groupoid Q and x in Q, define the right (left) translation map R_x: Q->Q by yR_x=yx (L_x: Q->Q by yL_x=xy). A loop is a groupoid Q with neutral element 1 in which all translations are bijections in Q. A loop Q is right conjugacy closed if (R_x)^(-1)R_yR_x is a right translation for every x, y in Q. Since any finite loop of order n < 5 is a group, then nonassociative right conjugacy closed loops exist when the order n > 5. In the literature, every nonassociative right conjugacy closed loop of order n can be represented as a union of certain conjugacy classes of a transitive group of degree n. The number of nonassociative right conjugacy closed loops of order n up to isomorphism were summarized in LOOPS version 3.3.0, Computing with quasigroups and loops in GAP (Groups, Algorithm and Programming).
