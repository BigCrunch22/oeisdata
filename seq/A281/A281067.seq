%N A281067 a(1) = 1; a(n) is the smallest natural number such that a(n) > a(n-1), and the name of a(n) in English starts with the letter a(n-1) ends with, and a(n) makes the sequence extendable.
%C A281067 "a(n) makes the sequence extendable" means the name of a(n) does not end with any of the letters r, x, y and d.
%e A281067 If a(5) were 90 (ninety, which ends with y), it would make the sequence finite. Therefore, a(5) has to be 91.
