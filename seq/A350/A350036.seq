%N A350036 Numbers k such that (81^k + 1)/82 is prime.
%C A350036 These are the Repunits in base -81. Since 81=3^4, factors will be of the form p=8nk+1. (Negative) bases that are powers of small numbers appear to have a higher frequency of primes than Repunits in other bases. The best linear fit for this base is currently 0.29918 which is much lower (better) than the conjectured 0.56145948 (see link to conjecture).
