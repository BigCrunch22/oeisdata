%N A350826 Number of prime sextuplets with n-digit initial term (A022008).
%C A350826 Prime sextuplets are of the form (p, p+4, p+6, p+10, p+12, p+16), where p is the initial member, listed in A022008.
%C A350826 For n = 1 and n = 2 (see Example), the last member of the sextuplet has one digit more than the initial member (so the count would be 0 for these two, if all terms of the sextuplet had to have the same length). As far as we know, for all n > 2, all members of the sextuplets have the same length. A sufficient condition for this is that A033874(n) > 16.

%F A350826 a(n) = # { p in A022008 | 10^(n-1) < p < 10^n }.
%e A350826 For n = 1, p = 7 is the only 1-digit prime to be the initial term of a prime sextuplet, (7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23), hence a(1) = 1.
%e A350826 For n = 2, p = 97 is the only 2-digit prime to be the initial term of a prime sextuplet, (97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113), whence a(2) = 1.
%e A350826 For n = 3 and n = 4, there is no n-digit prime to be the initial term of a prime sextuplet, so a(n) = 0.
%e A350826 For n = 5, {16057, 19417, 43777} are the only 5-digit primes which are initial members of a prime sextuplet, therefore a(5) = 3.
