%N A350712 a(n) is the smallest hexagonal number for which the symmetric representation of sigma(n) has width 2*n, n >= 0, at the diagonal.
%C A350712 The width of the symmetric representation of sigma for hexagonal numbers at the diagonal is 1 only for number 1. For any hexagonal number h(n) = n*(2*n-1), n>1, the last leg of the Dyck path of h(n)-1 has length 2 and that of h(n) has length 1 (see formula in A237591) so that the width of the symmetric representation of sigma at the diagonal is at least 2 and contains a subpart of size 1 at the diagonal (see A280851).
%C A350712 The geometry of the Dyck paths ensures that a square bisected by the diagonal whose side length equals the width of the symmetric representation of sigma at the diagonal fits between the bounding pair of Dyck paths.
%C A350712 For hexagonal numbers up to h(100000) = 19999900000 only 1225, 1413721, and 1631432881 (the 25th, 841st, and 28561st hexagonal numbers) have width 3 at the diagonal, and none were found of odd width greater than 3.
%C A350712 The next [last] number in the sequence data smaller than h(55000) = 6049945000 is a(42) = 4874349480 [a(49) = 4819214400] with a(31..41) > h(55000).
%C A350712 The numbers [1, 1225, 1413721, 1631432881] mentioned above (in the first comment and in the third comment) are the first four square-hexagonal numbers (A046177). - _Omar E. Pol_, Feb 04 2022
%e A350712 a(1) = 6, and a(2) = 120 since all hexagonal numbers k, 6 <= k < 120, have width 2 at the diagonal.
