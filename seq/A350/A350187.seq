%N A350187 Numbers of multiplicative persistence 8 which are themselves the product of digits of a number.
%C A350187 The multiplicative persistence of a number mp(n) is the number of times the product of digits function p(n) must be applied to reach a single digit, i.e., A031346(n).
%C A350187 The product of digits function partitions all numbers into equivalence classes. There is a one-to-one correspondence between values in this sequence and equivalence classes of numbers with multiplicative persistence 9.
%C A350187 There are infinitely many numbers with mp of 1 to 11, but the classes of numbers (p(n)) are postulated to be finite for sequences A350181.
%C A350187 Equivalently:
%C A350187 This sequence consists of all numbers A007954(k) such that A031346(k) = 9.
%C A350187 They are the numbers k in A002473 such that A031346(k) = 8.
%C A350187 Or they factor into powers of 2, 3, 5 and 7 exclusively and p(n) goes to a single digit in 8 steps.
%C A350187 Postulated to be finite and complete.
%C A350187 a(6), if it exists, is > 10^20000, and likely > 10^171000.

%e A350187 4478976 is in this sequence because:
%e A350187 - 4478976 goes to a single digit in 8 steps: 4478976 -> 338688 -> 27648 -> 2688 -> 768 -> 336 -> 54 -> 20 -> 0;
%e A350187 - p(438939648) = p(231928233984) = 4478976.
