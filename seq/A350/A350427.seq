%N A350427 a(n) is the maximum number of key comparisons required to sort n records with distinct keys using a modified heapsort (Algorithm H in Don Knuth's TAOCP Vol. 3, answer to exercise 18).
%C A350427 There are two places in R. W. Floyd's modified algorithm where the keys are compared. The first is in step H4 [Find larger child.] and the second in step H9' [Does K fit?]. The sequence shows the maxima of the counts of these comparisons, determined over all n! possible orders of the records.
