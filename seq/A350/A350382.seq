%C A350382 The 4th problem of 16th Tournament of Towns in 1994-1995, Spring tour 1995, 8-9 grades, Training option, asked for a proof that the number 400...009 with at least one zero is not a perfect square (see link).
%C A350382 Indeed, the first few squares whose digits are 0, 4 and 9 are 4900, 9409, 490000, 940900, 994009, ... (comes from A019544).
%C A350382 Generalization: the 4th problem of 16th Tournament of Towns in 1994-1995, Spring tour 1995, 10-11 grades, Training option, asked for a proof that the number d00...009 with at least one zero is not a perfect square, when d is a digit with 1 <= d <= 9 (see link).
