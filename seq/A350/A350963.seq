%N A350963 Coordination sequence for the XXOXX tiling with respect to a tile of type R.
%C A350963 The tile consists of five squares in a row with the center square missing. The tiling of the plane studied here is that shown in Fig. 2 of Gruslys et al., and in the other illustrations below. (An email from _Neil Bickford_ suggests that this may be the unique tiling of the plane using this tile.)
%C A350963 There are three orbits on tiles, which we denote by R, G, and B, corresponding to the colors in the illustrations. The tiles are drawn as two dominoes linked by a thin bridge. The symmetry group appears to be p2.
%C A350963 For the coordination sequence we regard two tiles as adjacent if they share a (long or short) edge. The two halves of a tile are marked with its generation number. The base (R) tile is marked with two 0's and is enclosed in a black border. The 9 generation 1 tiles are marked with two 1's and two black stars.
%C A350963 Each R tile touches 4 R's, 4 G's, and 1 B; each G tile touches 4 R's, 1 G, and 3 B's; each B tile touches 1 R, 3 G's, and 4 B's.

%F A350963 Conjectured g.f.: -(2*t^7-6*t^6-24*t^5-33*t^4-33*t^3-28*t^2-9*t-1)/((1-t^2)*(1-t^4)). Given the decomposition of this structure into eight sectors (see Sigrist's illustration of the first 100 generations), it should be possible to establish this g.f. and those of the other two coordination sequences by using the coloring book method. - _N.
