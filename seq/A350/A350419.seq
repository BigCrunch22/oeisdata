%N A350419 Irregular table read by rows, where row k lists the semiprimes, s*t (s<=t) in increasing order, where s and t are the smaller and larger parts of the partitions of m = 2k+2 into two parts.
%C A350419 The sequence consists of the set {4} UNION {odd semiprimes}. Every odd semiprime in the sequence appears exactly twice since for each partition of m = s + t where s, t are prime, there exists another partition of the form 1 + s*t and vice versa.
%C A350419 If the Goldbach conjecture is true, each row of the table in the example will have at least one Goldbach partition, m = s + t, where s and t are prime. For each odd semiprime that makes its first appearance in the sequence, and thus in some row u = m/2-1 of the table, that semiprime will occur again exactly once in row v = (s*t-1)/2 as the partition 1 + s*t. Likewise, each odd semiprime that makes its second appearance in the sequence will be a partition of some m of the form s + t = 1 + pq in some row v where p and q are (odd) primes. Its first occurrence will appear earlier in row u = (p+q)/2-1 of the table (see example).
