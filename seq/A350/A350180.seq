%N A350180 Numbers of multiplicative persistence 1 which are themselves the product of digits of a number.
%C A350180 The multiplicative persistence of a number mp(n) is the number of times the product of digits function p(n) must be applied to reach a single digit, i.e., A031346(n).
%C A350180 The product of digits function partitions all numbers into equivalence classes. There is a one-to-one correspondence between values in this sequence and equivalence classes of numbers with multiplicative persistence 2.
%C A350180 There are infinitely many numbers with mp of 1 to 11, but the classes of numbers (p(n)) are postulated to be finite for subsequent sequences A350181..., but not for this sequence (where mp(p(n)) = 1). That is because there are infinitely many numbers that include both an even digit (2, 4, 6 or 8), a 5 and no 0. For these numbers n, p(n) will include a zero and p(p(n)) will be 0.
%C A350180 Equivalently: This sequence contains all numbers A007954(k) such that A031346(k) = 2, and they are the numbers k in A002473 such that A031346(k) = 1.
%C A350180 Or, they factor into powers of 2, 3, 5 and 7 exclusively and p(n) goes to a single digit in 1 step.
