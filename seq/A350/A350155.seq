%N A350155 a(n) is the greatest number of times that a laser can hit a reflector on an n X n grid (see Comments for precise definition).
%C A350155 The problem is the following.
%C A350155 You are given an empty n X n grid. You can place some reflectors into the cells of the grid.
%C A350155 This arrangement consists of thin flat plates, each of which is rotatably mounted about a vertical axis so that two angular positions relative to the grid axes, namely plus and minus 45 degrees, are possible. A particle is shot into this arrangement and when it hits a reflector, it is deflected by 90 degrees without any loss of momentum according to the reflector's current orientation. After a reflector has been hit by the particle, it rotates by 90 degrees and maintains this position until the next hit. Not every grid position has to be assigned a reflector -- grid positions without reflectors are permitted.
