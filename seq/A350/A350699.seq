%N A350699 Numbers k such that tau(k) + tau(k+1) + tau(k+2) + tau(k+3) + tau(k+4) = 20, where tau is the number of divisors function A000005.
%C A350699 It can be shown that if tau(k) + ... + tau(k+4) = 20, the quintuple (tau(k), tau(k+1), tau(k+2), tau(k+3), tau(k+4)) must be one of the following, each of which might plausibly occur infinitely often:
%C A350699   (2, 4, 4, 6, 4), which first occurs at k = 19441, 266401, 423481, 539401, ... (A204592);
%C A350699   (2, 6, 4, 4, 4), which first occurs at k = 31, 211, 2731, 116131, ...;
%C A350699   (4, 4, 4, 6, 2), which first occurs at k = 2305, 229945, 350785, 495265, ...;
%C A350699   (4, 6, 4, 4, 2), which first occurs at k = 174595, 334315, 535915, 671035, ... ({A247348(n)} - 4);
%C A350699 or one of the following, each of which occurs only once:
%C A350699   (2, 6, 2, 6, 4), which occurs only at k = 17;
%C A350699   (2, 4, 4, 8, 2), which occurs only at k = 37;
%C A350699   (2, 6, 6, 4, 2), which occurs only at k = 43.
%C A350699 Tau(k) + ... + tau(k+4) >= 20 for all sufficiently large k; the only numbers k for which tau(k) + ... + tau(k+4) < 20 are 1..11, 13, 15, 19, and 25.

%F A350699 { k : tau(k) + tau(k+1) + tau(k+2) + tau(k+3) + tau(k+4) = 20 }.
%e A350699 The table below lists each term k with a pattern (tau(k), ..., tau(k+4)) that appears only once (these appear at n = 1, 3, and 4), as well as each term k that is the smallest one having a pattern that appears repeatedly for large k (these are at n = 2, 6, 8, and 10). It also includes k = a(5) = 211, which is the smallest k that not only has a pattern that appears repeatedly for large k but also has each of k, ..., k+4 divisible by a prime > 5. (k = a(2) = 31 is a special case in that, while it and k = 211 share the same pattern of tau values, i.e., (2, 6, 4, 4, 4), their prime signatures differ at k+1: both 31+1=32 and 211+1=212 have 6 divisors, but 32 is a 5th power.)
%e A350699 Each of the repeatedly occurring patterns corresponds to one of the four possible orders in which the multipliers m=1..5 can appear among 5 consecutive integers of the form m*prime, and thus to a single residue of k modulo 120; e.g., k=2305 begins a run of 5 consecutive integers having the form (5*p, 2*q, 3*r, 4*s, t), where p, q, r, s, and t are distinct primes > 5, and all such runs satisfy k == 25 (mod 120).
%e A350699 For each of the patterns of tau values that does not occur repeatedly, and also for the special case k = 31, one or more of the five consecutive integers in k..k+4 has no prime factor > 5; each such integer appears in parentheses in the "factorization" columns.
