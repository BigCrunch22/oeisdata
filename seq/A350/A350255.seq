%N A350255 a(n) is the numerator of the smallest ratio among the A341052(n) ratios for which there exist A341051(n) n-digit integers (the maximum possible) that are in geometric progression.
%C A350255 The numerator of the corresponding smallest ratio is the largest numerator on the n-th row of A341053, hence, a(n) is the last term of the n-th row of A341053.
%C A350255 The denominator of these corresponding ratios is equal to a(n) - 1.
%C A350255 This sequence is not increasing as a(38) = 16 > a(39) = 15.
%F A350255 a(n) = A350254(n) iff A341052(n) = 1.
%e A350255 There exist A341051(9) = 11 integers in the largest possible string with 9-digit numbers that are in geometric progression, and three such strings are obtained with the A341052(9) = 3 distinct following ratios 5/4 > 6/5 > 7/6. The smallest ratio is 7/6 and a(9) = 7.
