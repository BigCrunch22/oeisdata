%N A350075 Numbers whose maximal digit in their primorial base expansion is less than the maximal exponent in their prime factorization.
%C A350075 Numbers k for which the maximal prime exponent of A276086(k) is less than the maximal prime exponent of k, A051903(k).
%C A350075 Numbers k for which A328114(k) < A051903(k).
%C A350075 Numbers such that when the map x -> A276086(x) is applied to them, the maximal exponent in the prime factorization (A051903) decreases.

%e A350075 In primorial base (see A049345) 9 = 3^2 is written as "111" (because 1*6 + 1*2 + 1*1 = 9), whose maximal digit (1) is less than the maximal exponent in the prime factorization of 9 (2), therefore 9 is included in this sequence.
%e A350075 In primorial base 2048 = 2^11 is written as "95110", whose maximal digit 9 is less than 11, therefore 2048 is included in this sequence.
