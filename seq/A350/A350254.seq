%N A350254 a(n) is the numerator of the largest ratio among the A341052(n) ratios for which there exist A341051(n) n-digit integers (the maximum possible) that are in geometric progression.
%C A350254 The numerator of the corresponding largest ratio is the smallest numerator on the n-th row of A341053, hence, a(n) is the 1st term of the n-th row of A341053.
%C A350254 The corresponding denominator of these ratios is equal to a(n) - 1.
%C A350254 This sequence is not increasing as a(29) = 13 > a(30) = 12.
%F A350254 a(n) = T(n,1), 1st term of the n-th row of A341053.
%F A350254 a(n) = A350255(n) iff A341052(n) = 1.
%e A350254 There exist A341051(9) = 11 integers in the largest possible string with 9-digit numbers that are in geometric progression, and three such strings are obtained with the A341052(9) = 3 distinct following ratios 5/4 > 6/5 > 7/6. The largest ratio is 5/4 and a(9) = 5.
