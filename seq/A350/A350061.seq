%N A350061 Numbers k for which there exists a preimage m_1 such that A349194(m_1) = k but there is no preimage m_2 such that A349278(m_2) = k.
%C A350061 Numbers that can be expressed as the product of the sum of the first i digits of k, as i goes from 1 to the total number of digits of k for some k, but not as the product of the sum of the last i digits of m, with i going from 1 to the total number of digits of m, for any m.
%C A350061 The preimages m_1 are necessarily multiples of 10; the first few are 50, 70, 320, 500, 340, ...
%C A350061 As A349733 is a subsequence of A349865, there are no numbers t for which there exists a preimage m_4 such that A349278(m_4) = t but there is no preimage m_3 such that A349194(m_3) = t.
%e A350061 A349194(122) = 1*(1+2)*(1+2+2) = 15 and A349278(23) = 3*(3+2) = 15, hence, 15 is not a term.
%e A350061 A349194(50) = 5*(5+0) = 25 but there is no m_2 such that A349278(m_2) = 25, because 25 = A349865(1), hence 25 is a term.
%e A350061 A349194(340) = 3*(3+4)*(3+4+0) = 147 but there is no m_2 such that A349278(m_2) = 340, because 147 = A349865(47), hence 147 is a term.
