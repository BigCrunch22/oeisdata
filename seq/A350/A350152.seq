%N A350152 Abelian orders m for which there exist at least 2 groups with order m.
%C A350152 This sequence lists the abelian orders when there is an abelian group that is distinct from cyclic group. When there is only one group of order k, then k is in A003277 and this group is the cyclic group C_k.
%C A350152 Except for a(1) = 4, all the terms are odd, because of the existence of a non-abelian dihedral group D_{2*n} of order 2*n for each n > 2.
%C A350152 Every p^2, p prime, is a term and the 2 corresponding abelian groups are C_{p^2} and C_p X C_p.
%H A350152 Mathematics Stack Exchange, <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3719529/group-of-order-45-is-abelian">Group of order 45 is abelian</a>.
%F A350152 m such that A000001(m) = A000688(m) > 1.
%e A350152 4 is a term because the 2 groups of order 4 that are C_4 and C_2 X C_2, the Klein four-group, are both abelian and a(1) = 4 because there is no smallest order with 2 abelian groups.
%e A350152 45 is a term because the 2 groups of order 45 that are C_45 and C_5  X C_3 X C_3 are both abelian.
%e A350152 99 is another term because the 2 groups of order 99 that are C_99 and C_11 X C_3 X C_3 are both abelian.
