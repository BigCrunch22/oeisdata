%N A350875 a(n) is the number of nonisomorphic left-right-alternative magmas with n elements. That is, a(n) is the number of nonisomorphic magmas with n elements which satisfy the identities (xx)y = x(xy) and x(yy) = (xy)y for all x and y.
%C A350875 Compare with A350876, whose terms are smaller (for n > 2) - this means that the left and right alternative identities (xx)y = x(xy) and x(yy) = (xy)y do not imply the flexible identity (xy)x = x(yx) for magmas. This is in contrast to the situation for non-associative rings, where left-right-alternativity implies flexibility (due to the additional additive structure).
%C A350875 a(n) = A350874(n) for n <= 2, i.e., a magma with (zero, one or) two elements which is left (resp., right) alternative is also right (resp., left) alternative.
%e A350875 There are 10 nonisomorphic magmas with 2 elements, 5 of which are left-right-alternative, so a(2) = 5.
%e A350875 Similarly there are 3330 nonisomorphic magmas with 3 elements, 43 of which are left-right-alternative, so a(3) = 43.
