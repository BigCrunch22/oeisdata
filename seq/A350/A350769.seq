%N A350769 Numbers k such that tau(k) + ... + tau(k+5) = 28, where tau is the number of divisors function A000005.
%C A350769 It can be shown that if tau(k) + ... + tau(k+5) = 28, the sextuple (tau(k), tau(k+1), tau(k+2), tau(k+3), tau(k+4), tau(k+5)) must be one of the following, each of which might plausibly occur infinitely often:
%C A350769   (2, 4, 4, 6, 4, 8), which first occurs at k = 5516281, 16831081, 18164161, ... (A208455);
%C A350769   (2, 8, 4, 6, 4, 4), which first occurs at k = 2914913, 9018353, 17800553, ...;
%C A350769   (4, 4, 6, 4, 8, 2), which first occurs at k = 18362, 6618242, 18646202, ...;
%C A350769   (8, 4, 6, 4, 4, 2), which first occurs at k = 7224834, 9339114, 10780554, ...;
%C A350769 or one of the following, each of which occurs only once:
%C A350769   (4, 6, 2, 8, 2, 6),  which occurs only at k = 27;
%C A350769   (6, 2, 8, 2, 6, 4),  which occurs only at k = 28;
%C A350769   (8, 2, 6, 4, 4, 4),  which occurs only at k = 30;
%C A350769   (2, 4, 4, 8, 2, 8),  which occurs only at k = 37;
%C A350769   (4, 4, 8, 2, 8, 2),  which occurs only at k = 38;
%C A350769   (2, 8, 2, 6, 6, 4),  which occurs only at k = 41;
%C A350769   (8, 2, 6, 6, 4, 2),  which occurs only at k = 42;
%C A350769   (4, 4, 2, 12, 2, 4), which occurs only at k = 57.
%C A350769 The terms of the repeatedly occurring patterns form sequence A071368.
%C A350769 Tau(k) + ... + tau(k+5) >= 28 for all sufficiently large k; the only numbers k for which tau(k) + ... + tau(k+5) < 28 are 1..26, 29, 33, and 34.
%H A350769 Jon E. Schoenfield, <a href="/A350769/b350769.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..10000</a>
%F A350769 { k : Sum_{j=0..5} tau(k+j) = 28 }.
%e A350769 The table below lists each term k with a pattern (tau(k), ..., tau(k+5)) that appears only once (these appear at n = 1..8) as well as each term k that is the smallest one having a pattern that appears repeatedly for large k. (a(12)=6618242 is omitted from the table because it has the same pattern as a(9)=18362.)
%e A350769 Each of the repeatedly occurring patterns corresponds to one of the four possible orders in which the multipliers m=1..6 can appear among 6 consecutive integers of the form m*prime, and thus to a single residue of k modulo 2520; e.g., k=18362 begins a run of 6 consecutive integers having the form (2*p, 3*q, 4*r, 5*s, 6*t, 1*u), where p, q, r, s, t, and u are distinct primes > 6, and all such runs satisfy k == 722 (mod 2520).
%e A350769 For each of the patterns that does not occur repeatedly, one or more of the six consecutive integers in k..k+5 has no prime factor > 6; each such integer appears in parentheses in the "factorization" columns.
