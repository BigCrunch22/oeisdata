%N A350114 Number of Deutsch paths with peaks at odd height.
%C A350114 a(n) is the number of closed Deutsch paths of n steps with all peaks at odd height.  A Deutsch path is a lattice path of up-steps (1,1) and down-steps (1,-j), j>=1, starting at the origin that never goes below the x-axis, and it is closed if it ends on the x-axis.
%C A350114 A166300 counts closed Deutsch paths with all peaks at even height.
