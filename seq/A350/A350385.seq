%N A350385 Minimum number of zeros that need to be added to x_n ones such that a combination of these zeros and ones can make a number b with the property gcd(b, rev(b)) = digitsum(b) = x_n where x_n is coprime to 10.
%C A350385 Only for numbers x_n coprime to 10 (A045572, i.e., numbers ending with 1,3,7 or 9) do there exist numbers b such that gcd(b, rev(b)) = x_n and digitsum(b) = x_n (rev(b) is the digit reversal of b, e.g., rev(123) = 321). If b must consist only of zeros and ones, the smallest values of b that satisfy these two constraints are converted to decimal and form sequence A348480. The question arose: How many zeros are needed for each x_n to find a matching number b? In most cases just a few zeros are enough, but some numbers, such as 7, 11, 13 and 37, require more zeros than ones and the corresponding b is called a "long solution". x_n = 101 requires 304 zeros because 101 is a porous number (see A337832).

%e A350385 a(2) = 1 because x_2 = 3 and if you add 1 zero to 3 ones you can form b = 1011 for which gcd(b,rev(b)) = digitsum(b) = 3.
