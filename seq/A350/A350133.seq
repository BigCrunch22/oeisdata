%N A350133 Last denominator in each run of odd terms in the greedy rearrangement of the alternating harmonic series that converges to 2.
%C A350133 The Riemann series theorem tells us that we can rearrange the terms of the alternating harmonic series 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 ... to converge to any number. If we do so using a greedy algorithm to converge to 2, we start with the positive terms 1 + 1/3 + 1/5 + ... + 1/15 which is just over 2, then add the first negative term -1/2, then add 1/17 + 1/19 + ... + 1/41 which is just over 2, then add -1/4, and so on. We take the last denominator in each run as our sequence, so a(1) = 15, a(2) = 41, and so on.
%C A350133 It appears that each subsequent term is either 26 or 28 more than the previous.

%e A350133 For n=3 the third run of terms with odd denominators is 1/43 + 1/45 + ... + 1/69 and so a(3) = 69.
