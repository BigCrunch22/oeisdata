%N A350086 a(n) is the smallest totient number k > 1 such that A005277(n)*k is a nontotient number, or 0 if no such number exists.
%C A350086 Subsequence of A350085.
%C A350086 Conjecture: a(n) != 0 for all n.
%C A350086 Records: 22 (A005277(n) = 14), 106 (A005277(n) = 90), 2010 (A005277(n) = 450), ...
%C A350086 By definition, a totient number N > 1 is a term if and only if there exists an even nontotient r such that: (i) k*r is a totient for totient numbers 2 <= k < N; (ii) N*r is a nontotient. No term can be of the form m*m', where m > 1 is a totient and m' > 1 is in A301587 (otherwise m*r is a totient implies m*m'*r is a totient).
%C A350086 Conjecture: every totient number > 1 which is not of the form m*m', where m > 1 is a totient and m' > 1 is in A301587, appears in this sequence. For example, the numbers 2, 6, 10, 18, 22, 28, 30 first appears when A007617(n) = 7, 15, 5, 33, 11, 902, 3.

%e A350086 A005277(11) = 90. N = 106 is a totient number > 1 such that 90*k is a totient for totient numbers 2 <= k < N, and 90*N is a nontotient, so a(11) = 106.
%e A350086 A005277(83) = 450. N = 2010 is a totient number > 1 such that 450*k is a totient for totient numbers 2 <= k < N, and 450*N is a nontotient, so a(83) = 2010.
%e A350086 A005277(187) = 902. N = 28 is a totient number > 1 such that 902*k is a totient for totient numbers 2 <= k < N, and 902*N is a nontotient, so a(187) = 28.
%e A350086 A005277(73991) = 241010. N = 100 is a totient number > 1 such that 241010*k is a totient for totient numbers 2 <= k < N, and 241010*N is a nontotient, so a(73991) = 100. Note that although 100 = 10*10 is a product of 2 totient number > 1, neither factor is in A301587, so nothing prevents that 100 is a term of this sequence.
