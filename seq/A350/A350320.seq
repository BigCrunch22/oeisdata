%N A350320 Totient numbers k such that 10*k is a nontotient.
%C A350320 10 is the smallest totient number that is not in A301587.
%C A350320 If 10*phi(m) is a nontotient, then m is divisible by 121 but not by 5, so every term is divisible by 110.
%C A350320 Proof. In the following cases, 10*phi(m) is a totient number:
%C A350320 (a) If m is not divisible by 11, then phi(11*m) = phi(11)*phi(m) = 10*phi(m).
%C A350320 (b) If m is divisible by 11 but not by 121 or 5, then phi((m/11)*125) = phi(m/11)*phi(125) = (phi(m)/10)*100 = 10*phi(m).
%C A350320 (c) If m is divisible by 5 but not by 2, then phi(4*5*m) = phi(4)*phi(5*m) = 2*(5*phi(m)) = 10*phi(m).
%C A350320 (d) If m is divisible by 5 and 2, then phi(10*m) = 10*phi(m).
%C A350320 So the only left case is that m is divisible by 121 but not by 5.

%e A350320 110 is a term since 110 = phi(121) = phi(242), but phi(n) = 10*110 = 1100 has no solution.
%e A350320 13310 is a term since 13310 = phi(14641) = phi(29282), but phi(n) = 10*13310 = 133100 has no solution.
