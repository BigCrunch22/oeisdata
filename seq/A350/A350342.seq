%N A350342 Numbers k such that k^2 is an abelian order.
%C A350342 Such k must be squarefree. Actually, such k must be a cyclic number (A003277).
%C A350342 Number of the form p_1*p_2*...*p_r where the p_i are distinct primes and no (p_j)^2-1 is divisible by any p_i.
%C A350342 The smallest term with exactly n distinct prime factors is given by A350340.
%C A350342 From the term 5 on, no term can be divisible by 2 or 3.

%F A350342 A350343(n) = a(n)^2.
%e A350342 For primes p, p is a term since every group of order p^2 is abelian. Such group is isomorphic to either C_{p^2} or C_p X C_p.
%e A350342 For primes p, q, if p^2 !== 1 (mod q), q^2 !== 1 (mod p), then p*q is a term since every group of that order is abelian. Such group is isomorphic to C_{p^2*q^2}, C_p X C_{p*q^2}, C_q X C_{p^2*q} or C_{p*q} X C_{p*q}.
