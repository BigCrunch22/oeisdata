%N A210985 Number of segments needed to draw the toothpick structure of A139250 as it is after 2^n stages.
%C A210985 It appears that this is also the partial sums of A039301.
%C A210985 It appears that this is also 1 together with A160128.

%F A210985 a(n) = A139252(2^n).
%e A210985 For n = 3, after 2^3 stages the toothpick structure of A139250 contains 43 toothpicks (A139250(2^3) = 43). However the toothpick structure can be essentially represented by 19 segments (A139252(2^3) = 19), so a(3) = 19.
%Y A210985 Cf. A007583, A039301, A139250, A139252, A147614, A160128.
