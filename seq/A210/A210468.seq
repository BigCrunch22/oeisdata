%N A210468 Collatz (3x+1) problem with rational numbers: number of steps to reach the end of the cycle starting with 1/(2n+1).
%C A210468 This variation of the "3x+1" problem with a class of rational numbers is as follows: start with any number 1/(2n+1). If the numerator is even, divide it by 2, otherwise multiply it by 3 and add 1. Do we always reach the end of a cycle with a rational number? It is conjectured that the answer is yes.
%C A210468 If x is of the form 1/2n, each trajectory is divergent because the numerator is always odd and tends into infinity.
%C A210468 If x is of the form x = m/(2n+1) where m is an integer, it is conjectured that the number of steps tends into the end of a finite cycle.
%C A210468 In this sequence, it appears that the last number of the cycle is 1 when 2n+1 is a power of 3. For example, starting with 1/9, the trajectory is 1/9 -> 4/3 -> 2/3 -> 1/3 -> 2 -> 1 with 5 iterations.
%C A210468 Observations: the last number of each trajectory has three possible forms: 1, 2/(2n+1) or a form m/(2n+1) where m> 2.

%e A210468 For n = 3, a(3) = 6 because the corresponding trajectory of 1/7 requires 6 iterations to reach the last term of the cycle:
%e A210468 1/7 -> 10/7 -> 5/7 -> 22/7 -> 11/7 -> 40/7 -> 20/7 and 20/7 is the last term because 20/7 -> 10/7 is already in the trajectory. The rational 10/7 has two antecedents: 1/7 and 20/7 are in the same trajectory (this property is conjecturally impossible in the classical 3x + 1 problem with x integer). The periodic nontrivial loop contains 6 distinct rational numbers (20/7 ->10/7->5/7 ->22/7 -> 11/7 -> 40/7).
