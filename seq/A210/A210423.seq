%e A210423 The sequence cannot start with 1 because the first digit is not 9. Let us start with 2: the second digit is equal to 9. The third digit cannot be 3 because the third digit is not 9. So let it be 4. In the next position we now have 90 because it is the minimum number greater than 8 and starting with the digit 9. And so on.
