%e A210420 The sequence cannot start with 1 because the first digit is not 6. Let us start with 2: the second digit is equal to 6. The third digit cannot be 3 because the third digit is not 6. So let it be 4. In the next position we now have 60 because it is the minimum number greater than 6 and starting with the digit 6. And so on.
