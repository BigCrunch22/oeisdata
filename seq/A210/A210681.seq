%N A210681 Number of ways to write 2n = p+q+r (p<=q) with p, q, r-1, r+1 all prime and p-1, p+1, q-1, q+1, r all practical.
%C A210681 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 4.
%C A210681 This conjecture involves two kinds of sandwiches introduced by the author, and it is much stronger than the Goldbach conjecture for odd numbers. We have verified the conjecture for n up to 10^7.
%C A210681 Zhi-Wei Sun also made the following conjectures:
%C A210681 (1) Any even number greater than 10 can be written as the sum of four elements in the set
%C A210681     S = {prime p: p-1 and p+1 are both practical}.
%C A210681 Also, every n=3,4,5,... can be represented as the sum of a prime in S and two triangular numbers.
%C A210681 (2) Each integer n>7 can be written as p + q + x^2 (or p + q + x(x+1)/2), where p is a prime with p-1 and p+1 both practical, and q is a practical number with q-1 and q+1 both prime.
%C A210681 (3) Every n=3,4,... can be written as the sum of three elements in the set
%C A210681     T = {x: 6x is practical with 6x-1 and 6x+1 both prime}.
%C A210681 (4) Any integer n>6 can be represented as the sum of two elements of the set S and one element of the set T.
%C A210681 (5) Each odd number greater than 11 can be written in the form 2p+q+r, where p and q belong to S, and r is a practical number with r-1 and r+1 both prime.
