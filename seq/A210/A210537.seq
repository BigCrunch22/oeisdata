%N A210537 a(1)=3; for n>1, a(n)>a(n-1) is the minimal for which the set {a(1),a(2),...,a(n)} lacks at least one residue mod 2, 3, ....
%C A210537 By the construction, for every N>1, the sequence does not contain a full residue system modulo N. The difference of any two primes greater than 3 in this sequence is a multiple of 6.
%C A210537 Conjectures: (1) the sequence contains infinitely many "twins" when such differences equal 6; (2) lim a(n)/prime(n)=1 as n goes to infinity.

%e A210537 All terms are odd, so {a(1), ...,} does not contain a complete residue system mod 2. All terms are 0 or 2 mod 3, so the sequence does not contain a complete residue system mod 3.
