%e A210421 The sequence cannot start with 1 because the first digit is not 7. Let us start with 2: the second digit is equal to 7. The third digit cannot be 3 because the third digit is not 7. So let it be 4. In the next position we now have 70 because it is the minimum number greater than 7 and starting with the digit 7. And so on.
