%e A210422 The sequence cannot start with 1 because the first digit is not 8. Let us start with 2: the second digit is equal to 8. The third digit cannot be 3 because the third digit is not 8. So let it be 4. In the next position we now have 80 because it is the minimum number greater than 8 and starting with the digit 8. And so on.
