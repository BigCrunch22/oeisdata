%N A210539 Positions n of digits "1" in the concatenated terms of A210538 for which A210538(n) is not prime.
%C A210539 Primes > 7 occur in A210538 at indices n corresponding to digits "1" in the concatenation of the terms. This sequence lists counterexamples for which the converse is not true, i.e., position of digits "1" not corresponding to primes.
%C A210539 Note the irregular distribution: there are no terms between 34 and 187, but then many terms up to 597. These are followed by only 7 terms preceding 1020, which starts a series of 6 terms up to 1140.
%e A210539 a(1)=1 because the 1st digit of A210538 is "1", but A210538(1)=1 is not prime.
%e A210539 a(2)=10, because the 10th digit of A210538 is "1", but A210538(10)=10 is not prime.
