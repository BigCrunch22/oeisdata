%N A210538 Least integer not occurring earlier, divisible by the n-th digit (or 10 for digit '0') of the sequence.
%C A210538 The first 10 terms are justified "a posteriori", i.e., they add the digit used in their own check for divisibility. Note that the title and definition (but not example) in Angelini's original post (cf. link) corresponds to a much more involved self-referencing sequence.
%C A210538 Primes > 7 occur at indices corresponding to digits "1" of the concatenated terms, e.g., 11=a(14), and the 14th digit is the "1" in a(12)=12. The converse is not true, e.g., the 10th, 19th, 22nd, 28th and 34th digits are "1" but for these n, a(n) is composite. The next counterexample is n=187, the last of 5 consecutive indices of "1"s. See A210539 for the list of these counterexamples and more details.
