%N A210993 Fermat pseudoprimes to base 2 of the form (6*k - 1)*((6*k - 2)*n + 1), where k and n are positive integers.
%C A210993 2-pseudoprimes are also called Poulet numbers. Some Poulet number can be written in more than one way in this form: e.g. 561 = (6*2 - 1)*((6*2 - 2)*5 + 1) = (6*3 - 1)*((6*3 - 2)*2 + 1).
%C A210993 Few examples of how the formula looks like for k and n from 1 to 4:
%C A210993 For k = 1 the formula becomes 20*n + 5 and so generates all the Poulet numbers divisible by 5.
%C A210993 For k = 2 the formula becomes 110*n + 11 and generates the Poulet numbers 341, 561 etc.
%C A210993 For k = 3 the formula becomes 272*n + 17 and generates the Poulet numbers 561, 1105, 2465, 4369 etc.
%C A210993 For k = 4 the formula becomes 506*n + 23 and generates the Poulet numbers 2047, 6601 etc.
%C A210993 For n = 1 the formula generates a perfect square.
%C A210993 For n = 2 the formula becomes 3*(6*k - 1)*(4*k - 1) and were found the following Poulet numbers: 561 etc.
%C A210993 For n = 3 the formula becomes (6*k - 1)*(18*k - 5) and were found the following Poulet numbers: 341, 2465, 8321, 83333 etc.
%C A210993 For n = 4 the formula becomes (6*k - 1)*(24*k - 7) and were found the following Poulet numbers: 1105, 2047, 3277, 6601, 13747, 16705, 19951, 31417, 74665, 88357 etc.
%C A210993 Note: the formula is equivalent to Poulet numbers of the form p*(n*p - n + 1), where p is of the form 6*k - 1. From the first 68 Poulet numbers just 26 of them (1387, 2701, 2821, 4033, 4681, 5461, 7957, 8911, 10261, 13741, 14491, 18721, 23377, 29341, 31609, 31621, 33153, 35333, 42799, 46657, 49141, 49981, 57421, 60787, 63973, 65281) canâ€™t be written as p*(n*p - n + 1), where p is of the form 6*k - 1 and k, n are integers different from 0.
