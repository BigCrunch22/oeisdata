%e A210416 The sequence starts with 2: the second digit is equal to 2. In the second position we cannot write only 2 because the first number is already 2. So we use the minimum number greater than 2 and beginning with digit 2, i.e., 20. In the third position we can write 1 because the digit in the first position is 2. And so on.
