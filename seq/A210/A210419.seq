%e A210419 The sequence cannot start with 1 because the first digit is not 5. Let us start with 2: the second digit is equal to 5. The third digit cannot be 3 because the third digit is not 5. So let it be 4. The next term must begin with a 5 because 4 is already in the sequence. Since 5 is also a previous term, it must be 55. With 2,4,5 already used, and 1,3,6 pointing at digits that are not 5, the next term must be 7.
