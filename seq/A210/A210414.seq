%N A210414 List the positions of all digits 0 in the concatenation of all terms, not necessarily in order. This is the lexicographically earliest such sequence.

%e A210414 The sequence cannot start with 0 (offset starting from 1), 1 (in the first position we have 1, not 0) or 2 (the second entry cannot start with 0). So the sequence starts with 3. The next term is 10, which is the minimum number with 0 as its second digit. And so on.
%Y A210414 Cf. A210415-A210423. See A167519 for another version.
