%N A215776 Second-largest prime factor of the n-th number that is a product of exactly n primes.
%C A215776 This is to A215405 as 2nd largest prime factor is to largest (greatest) prime factor. Technically, the prime numbers are "1-almost prime."
%F A215776 a(n) = A087039(A101695(n)).
%e A215776 a(2) = 2 because the 2nd number that is a product of exactly 2 primes
%e A215776 (semiprime) is 6 = 2*3, so 2 is the 2nd largest of those two prime factors.
%e A215776 a(4) = 2 because the 4th number that is a product of exactly 4 primes is 40 = 2*2*2*5, so 2 is the 2nd largest of those two distinct prime factors {2,5}. This requires clarity in "distinct prime factors" versus merely "prime factors."
%e A215776 a(87) = 3 because the 87th number that is a product of 87 primes is 5048474222710691433572990976 = 2^84 3^2 29, and 3 is the 2nd largest prime factor.
