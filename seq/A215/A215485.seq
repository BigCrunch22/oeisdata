%N A215485 Periods of square root continued fractions at which A013646 sets a new record.
%C A215485 Each term of this sequence takes a turn at being the smallest unknown period for a square root continued fraction. Periods 1 and 2 are seen as the periods of sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) respectively, but a period of 3 is not seen until sqrt(41).
%C A215485 By convention, the period for perfect squares (e.g., 1) is 0.
%C A215485 Open question: Are there any more even terms after the 2?

%e A215485 When a square root continued fraction with a period of 3 is first seen (at sqrt(41)), the lowest period not yet seen is 7, which first occurs as the period of sqrt(58).
%Y A215485 Cf. A013646.
