%N A215459 Arises in quick gossiping without duplicate transmission.
%C A215459 As explained in Seress, there are n persons each knowing a piece of gossip not known to the others.  They communicate by telephone and whenever two persons talk they tell the other all of the gossip they know at that time.  a(n) lists those n for which there exists a number of economical calls, that is, the minimum, with the additional constraint that everybody hears each piece of gossip exactly once.
