%N A215637 Number of solutions of square array of integers, choosing one prime from each row and column.
%C A215637 Let p be the n-th prime number. Put 1 to p^2 into a square array in order.  Choose a set of primes such that there is one and only one in each row and column. This is equivalent to non-attacking rooks on prime-numbered squares. Then a(n) is the number of solutions for the n-th prime.
%D A215637 Martin Erickson, Beautiful Mathematics, Mathematical Association of America, 2011, p. 6. The problem is called Transversal of primes.
