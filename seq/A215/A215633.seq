%N A215633 Decimal expansion of Sum_{n>=1} 1/n^(n^prime(n)).
%C A215633 Is this a finite sequence? (or equivalently, is this constant rational?)
%C A215633 Unlikely: the "apparent" rationality seems to be caused by the rapid growth of the denominators; one may instead speculate that the value is transcendental. - _Joerg Arndt_, Feb 05 2013
%C A215633 The constant is approximately 257/256 (see A021260).
