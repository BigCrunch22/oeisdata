%N A215605 Number of unordered interval sequences that sum up to 12n in Schoenberg 12-tone rows.
%C A215605 A Schoenberg 12-tone row is a permutation of the integers from 0 to 11. It is assumed the first element is 0 so there are 11! 12-tone rows. The unordered interval sequence is the 1st-order difference modulo 12 arranged into a sorted list.

%e A215605 There is only one unordered interval sequence whose sum is 12, and it contains all ones. One of the 36 that sums up to 2*12=24 is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,11], and one of the 798 that sums up to 3*12=36 is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,11,11].
