%N A218465 Least integer b>2n+1 such that the numbers written as [1,3,...,2n-1,2n+1] and [2n+1,2n-1,...,3,1] in base b are both prime.
%C A218465 Conjecture: Let n be any positive integer. Then a(n) exists, moreover there are infinitely many integers b > 2n+1 such that [1,3,...,2n-1,2n+1] and [2n+1,2n-1,...,3,1] in base b are both prime. Also, the polynomial S_n(x) = sum_{k=0}^n (2k+1)*x^{n-k} is irreducible modulo some prime p < (n+1)(n+2), and the Galois group of S_n(x) over the field of rational numbers is isomorphic to the symmetric group S_n.
%C A218465 This conjecture can be extended by replacing 2k+1 by (2k+1)^m. For example, [1^2,3^2,5^2,...,61^2,63^2] and [63^2,61^2,...,3^2,1^2] in base b=241784 are both prime.
