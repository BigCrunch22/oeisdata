%N A218468 a(n+1) is a multiple of at least one digit of a(n); this is the lexicographically earliest injective such sequence.
%C A218468 "Lexicographically earliest injective sequence" means that a(n+1) is the least positive integer not occurring earlier with the given property.
%C A218468 Conjectured to be a permutation of the positive integers, which is the case if and only if an infinite number of terms have a digit "1".
%C A218468 Conjecture: For nonnegative integer x, 2*10^x appears at index 2*10^x (see A226179). _Hans Havermann_, May 29 2013
%C A218468 Fixed points, i.e., indices n for which a(n)=n, are listed in A226179. - _M. F. Hasler_, May 30 2013
%C A218468 B. Jubin and H. Havermann made remarks about this sequence in other bases, its fractal nature and fixed points: See the link to the SeqFan list. - _M. F. Hasler_, May 30 2013
