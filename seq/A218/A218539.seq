%N A218539 Numbers that are equal to the sum of the uniform platonic polyhedral (figurate) numbers (tetrahedral, cubic, octahedral, dodecahedral, or icosahedral) on each of their digits.
%C A218539 153, 370, 371, and 407 are well known with regard to the cubic numbers.
%e A218539 The octahedral numbers are represented by the formula, y(x)=(2x^3+x)/3; apply this formula to each of the digits in a(18)=739, i.e., y(7)=231, y(3)=19, y(9)=489; sum=739; the dodecahedral numbers are represented by the formula, y(x)=x(3x-1)(3x-2)/2; apply this formula to each of the digits in a(34)=9898, i.e., y(9)=2725, y(8)=2024; y(9)=2725, y(8)=2024; sum=9898.
