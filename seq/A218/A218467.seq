%N A218467 A variant of the Euclid-Mullin sequence A000945: a(1) = 2, a(n+1) is smallest prime factor congruent to 3 (mod 4) of Product_{k=1..n} a(k) + 1.
%C A218467 Just as the Euclid-Mullin sequence is suggested by Euclid's proof of an infinity of primes, this sequence is suggested by a variation of his proof, showing the existence of an infinity of primes congruent to 3 (mod 4).  See Hardy and Wright in the Reference below.
%C A218467 Could also be viewed as a variation on A217759.  Restricting the scope of "smallest prime factor congruent to 3 (mod 4)" to the larger of the two algebraic factors of 4Q^2-1 as defined in that sequence results in a sequence essentially the same as this one.
%C A218467 a(18) has 149 digits.

%e A218467 This sequence and A000945 are identical up to their fourth term.  The fifth terms of both that sequence and this one are factors of 2*3*7*43+1=13*139.  The smallest factor, used by A000945, is congruent to 1 (mod 4).  Here we take the larger.
