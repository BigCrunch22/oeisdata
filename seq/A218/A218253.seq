%N A218253 The number of steps it takes, by taking the smallest number so that it minus the number of ones in its binary representation is the previous number, to reach a number which has no others that satisfy this property.
%C A218253 A218252 is divided into groups with length the numbers with odd position in this sequence.
%H A218253 Charles R Greathouse IV, <a href="/A218253/b218253.txt">Table of n, a(n) for n = 1..10000</a>
%e A218253 For n=7, the numbers you get are 7,8,10,12, and because this takes 3 steps, the 7th term is 3.
