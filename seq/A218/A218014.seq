%N A218014 Location of the n-th prime in its Andrica ranking.
%C A218014 For each consecutive prime pair p < q, d = sqrt(q) - sqrt(p) is unique. Place d in order from greatest to least and specify p.
%C A218014 Last appearance by prime index: 1, 5, 7, 10, 13, 17, 20, 26, 28, 33, 35, 41, 43, 45, 49, ..., .
%C A218014 Last appearance of a minimum prime by Andrica ranking: 2, 11, 17, 29, 41, 59, 71, 101, 107, 137, 149, 179, ..., .
%C A218014 As expected, this sequence is the lesser of the twin primes beginning with the second term, 11. See A001359.

%e A218014 a(1)=27 since the first prime, 2, does not show up in the ranking until the 27th term. See A218013.
%e A218014 a(4)=1 since the fourth prime, 7, has the maximum A_n value, see A218012; i.e., sqrt(p_n)-sqrt(p_n+1) is at a maximum.
