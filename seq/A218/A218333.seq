%N A218333 The index of the smallest n-isolated prime p such that p/n is not between 2 and 3 and not between the smaller and greater primes of a twin prime pair, or 0 if no such p exists.
%C A218333 For n>=2, a prime p is called n-isolated (cf. A166251 and the Shevelev link, Section 10) if there is no other prime in the interval (n*prevprime(p/n), n*nextprime(p/n)).
%C A218333 In particular, if a(n)=1, then the smallest n-isolated prime divided by n is not between 2 and 3 and not between the smaller and greater primes of a twin prime pair.
%C A218333 Suppose that for every n there exist infinitely many n-isolated primes.  Then if there exists n_0 such that a(n_0)=0, there are infinitely many twin primes. On the other hand, one can prove that the smallest n-isolated prime divided by n tends to infinity as n goes to infinity. Therefore, if there is not an N such that, for all n >= N, a(n)=1, then we also conclude that there are infinitely many twin primes.
%C A218333 Conjecture: all a(n) >= 2.

%e A218333 Let n=2. The 2-isolated primes are in A166251.
%e A218333 The first 2-isolated prime is 5, and 5/2 is between 2 and 3.
%e A218333 The second 2-isolated prime is 7, and 7/2 is between 3 and 5.
%e A218333 The third 2-isolated prime is 23, and 23/2 is between 11 and 13.
%e A218333 The fourth 2-isolated prime is 37, and 37/2 is between 17 and 19.
%e A218333 The fifth 2-isolated prime is 79, and 79/2 is between 37 and 41.  Since (37,41) is not (2,3) and is not a twin prime pair, a(2)=5
