%N A218090 Number of unlabeled point-determining bipartite graphs on n vertices.
%C A218090 A graph is point-determining if no two vertices have the same set of neighbors. This kind of graph is also called a mating graph.

%e A218090 Consider n = 3. The triangle graph is point-determining, but it is not bipartite, so it is not counted in a(3). The graph *--*--* is bipartite, but it is not point-determining (the vertices on the two ends have the same neighborhood), so it is also not counted in a(3). The only graph counted in a(3) is the graph *--*  *. - _Justin M. Troyka_, Nov 27 2013
