%N A218558 Next number that is the product of exactly three (not necessarily distinct) primes, after 10*n.
%C A218558 This is to "triprimes" A014612 as A185008 is to semiprimes A001358, and as A218255 is to primes A000040.
%C A218558 The first equal terms are a(4) = a(5) = 42. The density of numbers n such that a(n) = a(n+1) is 1. Similarly, the density of numbers n such that a(n) = a(n+1) = ... = a(n+k) is 1 for any fixed k. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Aug 30 2017
%F A218558 a(n) = MIN[k in A014612 and k > 10*n = A008592(n)].
%e A218558 a(0) = 8, the first number that is the product of exactly three (not necessarily distinct) primes.
%e A218558 a(1) = 12 = 2^2 * 3, which is >10*1=10.
%e A218558 a(3) = 42 even though 30 = 2*3*5 is a "triprime" because we use ">" rather that ">=" in the definition.
