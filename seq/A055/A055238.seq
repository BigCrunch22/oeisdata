%N A055238 Numbers that are divisible by at least one of their digits in every base.
%C A055238 This list is probably finite and complete. For example 180 fails at base 23 and 240 fails at bases 21, 31 and 33
%e A055238 9 is included because it can be written as 111111111,1001,100,21,14,13,12,11,10 or 9 and in every case there is a digit which divides 9; 11 is not on the list because in base 4 it is written 23 and 11 is not divisible by either 2 or 3.
