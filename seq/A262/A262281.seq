%N A262281 a(n) = smallest nonnegative number, not a power of 2, that is not a substring of n in its binary representation.
%C A262281 Similar to A261922, but if the smallest missing number is a power of 2, ignore it and look at the next-smallest missing number.
%C A262281 This is like applying A261922 not to n itself but to n plus a very large power of 2. Suggested by considering A261416.

%e A262281 For n = 13 = 1101_2, we can see 0, 11 (3), 101 (5), 110 (6), but not 111 (7), so a(13)=7.
%Y A262281 Cf. A261416, A261461, A261922.
%Y A262281 See A262289 for the "positive" version.
