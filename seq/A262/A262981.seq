%N A262981 Numbers k such that the least positive integer having exactly k divisors is divisible by k.
%C A262981 The sequence contains numbers n for which A005179(n) is a multiple of n.
%C A262981 In turn, A002110 is a subsequence.

%C A262981 2 is the only prime in the sequence. Let p be the largest prime divisor of n. If n is in the sequence, then is it true that n/p is in the sequence? Not for n = 20.
%C A262981 Elements > 1 have the property primepi(p) <= bigomega(n). For 2 <= k <= 100000, only 2114 values k have this property. (End)

%C A262981 The first comment in other words: a positive integer n is in this sequence iff A005179(n) is in A033950.
%C A262981 Note that p! is in the sequence for all primes p. On the other hand, each number in the run from (2^n)! to q-1, where n>2 and q is the least prime greater than (2^n)!, isn't in the sequence.
%C A262981 Let p be an odd prime and s > 0. Then p^s is in the sequence if and only if pi(p) <= s < p.
%C A262981 Let k > 1. There are infinitely many k such that n^k is in the sequence.
%C A262981 Some conjectures for a(n):
%C A262981 1. Let b be in a(n). Then A005179(b) is in a(n) too. In other words, A262983 is a subsequence of a(n).
%C A262981 2. Let b be any positive integer and b_1 denote A005179(b), b_2 denote A005179(b_1), and so on. Then b_k is in a(n) for some k. (End)

%e A262981 9 is in the sequence because the least positive integer having exactly 9 divisors is 36, which is divisible by 9.
