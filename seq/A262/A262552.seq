%N A262552 Numbers n such that the concatenation of the decimal numbers 1 through n, but omitting 5, is a prime.
%C A262552 The corresponding primes are the primes in A262575.
%C A262552 The actual values of a(1) to a(4) are also primes, although that is not a necessary condition for a number to belong to this sequence. Not all the terms of A262300 are primes, for example.
%C A262552 Probabilistic arguments suggest the sequence is infinite.
%C A262552 a(5) > 10000. - _Robert Price_, Nov 03 2018
