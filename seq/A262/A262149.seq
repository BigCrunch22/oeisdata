%N A262149 Rocket sequence 50: a(0)=50, a(n)=A073846(a(n-1)).
%C A262149 This sequence has been checked up to a(98) = 1078406742163 without reaching 50. It seems to be slowly climbing in value in both the negative and positive directions. Hence, its period is either extremely large or, as I conjecture, infinite. Thus I dubbed the sequence "Rocket" because, as opposed the "Hailstone" sequences, it never seems to "fall".
%C A262149 This sequence, when extended to all integers using a(n-1) = A073898(a(n)), is R#(50), see A073846 for definition. - _Chayim Lowen_, Jan 25 2016
