%N A262693 Characteristic function for A259934.
%C A262693 Apart from a(0)=1 the first differences of A262694.
%C A262693 From _Antti Karttunen_, Nov 29 2015: (Start)
%C A262693 Provided that A259934 indeed is the unique infinite sequence s satisfying the condition A049820(s(k)) = s(k-1) for all k>=1, then the alternative but equivalent definition for this sequence is: a(n) = 0 if there are only finitely many integers from which one can reach n by repeated iterations of A049820, and 1 otherwise.
%C A262693 In case A259934 were not a unique solution, but only the lexicographically earliest branch of several, then the above alternative definition would produce more 1's after some (large) value of n. It would also be a more appropriate definition for the sequences like A262522 (A262896) and A262695 - A262697 (to keep them well-defined in principle), than the current, more restricted definition of this sequence.
