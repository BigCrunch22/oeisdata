%N A262174 Sierpiński arrowhead curve as a triangular array starting leftward from the top, read by rows.
%C A262174 The triangle up to the (1 + 2^n)th row is the n-th iteration of the curve, rotated such that the curve begins at the top and continues down to the left.
%C A262174 As this is not a space-filling curve, not all points on the triangular lattice are reached by the curve; these points are given the value 0.
