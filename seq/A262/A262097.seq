%N A262097 a(n) is the number of arithmetic triples k<m<n (three numbers in arithmetic progression) such that k and m contain no 2's in their ternary representation.
%C A262097 This is a recursive sequence that gives the number of times n is rejected from A005836, if n is the largest member of an arithmetic triple whose initial two terms are contained in A005836.
%C A262097 This is similar to both A002487, which has a similar recurrence relation and counts hyperbinary representations of n, and A000119, which counts representations of n as a sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers.
%C A262097 a(n) is the number of times n occurs in A262096.
%C A262097 Indices of maxima between a(n)=0 and a(k)=0 (choose the smallest k) appear to converge to (1/12)*(k-n) and (1/4)*(k-n). - _Max Barrentine_, May 24 2016

%F A262097 a(0)=0, a(n) = a(3n) = a(3n+1); if a(n)=0, a(3n+2) = a(n+1) + 1, otherwise a(3n+2) = a(n+1) + a(n). - _Max Barrentine_, May 24 2016
