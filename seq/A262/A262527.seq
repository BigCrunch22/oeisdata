%N A262527 Conjectured minimum number of ways to represent a number >= A262526(i) by sums of three base-10 palindromes.
%C A262527 The sequence is obtained by sorting the counts A261132 into increasing order together with their positions of occurrence. If a new record in the sorted A261132 is found, the index of its latest occurrence in A261132 becomes the next term in A262526 and the corresponding value of A261132 becomes a(n).
%C A262527 7 is not in the sequence, because the latest occurrence of 7 is at A261132(64), whereas the latest occurrence of 6 had already set the record to A262526(6) = 120.
%C A262527 a(7) = 8 corresponds to the latest occurrence of 8 at A261132(142), thus A262526(7) = 142.

%e A262527 a(5) = 5 because A261132(k) > 5 for all k > A262526(5) = 98.
