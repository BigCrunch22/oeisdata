%N A077667 Triangle read by rows. Let k = n-th composite number. The n-th row gives k smallest numbers unrelated to k (numbers which do not divide k, are not divisible by k and are not coprime to k).
%C A077667 Primes do not have unrelated numbers.
%e A077667 The first few rows are:
%e A077667   6, 10, 14, 18;
