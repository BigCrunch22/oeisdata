%N A077769 Number of times that the sum of two coprime squares of opposite parity is an integer between n^2 and (n+1)^2; multiple representations are counted multiply.
%C A077769 See A077768 for a similar, but less restrictive sequence. A077774 counts multiple representations only once. Note that by also requiring a unique representation, we obtain sequence A077766, which counts primes of the form 4k+1.
%e A077769 a(8)=3 because 65=64+1, 65=49+16 and 73=64+9 are between squares 49 and 64. Note that 65 occurs twice.
