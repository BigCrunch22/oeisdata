%N A077016 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 4, continue by dividing by the smallest prime not used earlier and multiplying with the smallest composite number just greater than the previous prime used in the division and then take the integer part at every step.
%C A077016 a(n) = 0 for n>23. Sequence needs some refinement. Can some improvement be suggested so that no term is zero.
%e A077016 a(3) = 4/2 = 2, a(4) = 2*6 = 12, a(5) = 12/3 = 4, a(6) = 4*8 = 32, a(7) = floor(32/5) = 6.
