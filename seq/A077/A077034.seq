%N A077034 a(1)=3; a(2n), a(2n+1) are smallest integers > a(2n-1) such that a(2n-1)^2+a(2n)^2=a(2n+1)^2.
%C A077034 Note that each time two more terms are added simultaneously. The sequence is infinite.
%C A077034 Smallest sequence of Pythagorean triples {a(k-1),a(k),a(k+1)},with k=2n,such that the hypotenuse of one triangle is the short leg of the next one. Such a sequence is called 2-prime Pythagorean because only the first two triangles (3,4,5),(5,12,13) both have prime hypotenuse and short leg. The next such sequence is given by A076604. Actually, the starting terms for all 2-prime and 3-prime Pythagorean triangles are given respectively by A048270 and A048295. The starting term for the smallest n-prime Pythagorean triangle is A105318. - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Sep 16 2005
%C A077034 a(2n) <= (a(2n-1)^2-1)/2; a(2n+1) <= (a(2n-1)^2+1)/2. [_Max Alekseyev_, May 11 2011]
%e A077034 a(1)=3 implies a(2)=4 and a(3)=5: 3^2+4^2=5^2.
%e A077034 a(3)=5 implies a(4)=12 and a(5)=13: 5^2+12^2=13^2.
