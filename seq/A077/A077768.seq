%N A077768 Number of times that the sum of two squares is an integer between n^2 and (n+1)^2; multiple representations are counted multiply.
%C A077768 Related to the circle problem, cf. A077770. Note that 2*a(n)-A077770(n)/4 is the characteristic sequence for the Beatty sequence A001951. See A077769 for a more restrictive case. A077773 counts multiple representations only once.
%e A077768 a(8)=7 because 65=64+1, 65=49+16, 68=64+4, 72=36+36, 73=64+9, 74=49+25 and 80=64+16 are between squares 64 and 81. Note that 65 occurs twice.
