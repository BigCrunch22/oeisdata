%N A077696 a(0) = 2; a(n) = smallest multiple of a(n-1), not a multiple of 10, that contains all the digits of a(n-1).
%C A077696 "Contains all the digits of a(n-1)" means it can be obtained by inserting digits anywhere in a permutation of digits of a(n-1) (prefix, suffix or insertion), but zeros are not to be suffixed as to avoid the trivial solution a(n-1)*10.
%C A077696 The 5th term suggested by the original author was 1103520 = 110 * 10032. This lets us guess that the intended definition was to exclude the trivial solution a(n-1)*10, but not any multiple of 10. But the definition has been amended to exclude multiples of 10 completely, and a(5) has been changed to the current value. Similarly, after a(8) = 1826063419107312, there would be a nontrivial solution a(9) = a(8)*5 = 2401273396126115280, where the final 0 is not appended but one of the 0's already in a(8). This is however excluded by the definition. - _M. F. Hasler_, Nov 18 2018
