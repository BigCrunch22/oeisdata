%N A077078 Number of different absolute values of vector sums generated by n vectors chosen from 2n (equally spaced) points around the unit circle. Dipole moments of n positive and n negative equally spaced charges on a circle.
%C A077078 Starting from n ones and n zero's cf. A006840, the simplification can remove subsets of ones with vector sum equal to zero, thus lowering the count of ones in the simplified bracelet.
%C A077078 The count is lower than A077079 because the absolute vector sums can be equal without being symmetrically related.
%e A077078 The 35 bracelets for n=6 simplify to the following 20: {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1}, {0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1}, {0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1}, {0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1}, {0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1}, {0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1}, {0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1}
%Y A077078 Cf. A077079, A006840.
