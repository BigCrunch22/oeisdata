%N A077215 Prime power with largest index that divides the product of composite numbers between successive primes with a(1) = a(2) = 1.
%C A077215 In case of more than two qualifying candidates the largest one is the member.
%e A077215 a(4) = 3 as 3 is the largest prime power dividing 6 which is the only composite number between 5 and 7. a(4) is not 2 though it is also a candidate but 2<3. a(5) = 16 which divides 8*9*10 for prime pair (7,11).
