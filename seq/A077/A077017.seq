%N A077017 a(1) = 2, a(n+1) = smallest positive integer divisible by the n-th prime that also has a nontrivial common divisor with a(n).
%C A077017 Each term of the sequence is a solution of the equation sigma(x)=3*(x-phi(x)) (*) - the proof is easy. Does there exist a solution of (*) which is not in the sequence? - _Farideh Firoozbakht_, Apr 22 2006
