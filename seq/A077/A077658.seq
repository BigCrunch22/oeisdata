%N A077658 Least composite number not congruent to 0 (modulo the first n primes) which contains its greatest proper divisor as a substring of itself, both in base two.
%e A077658 a(0)=4 since 4_d = 100_b and its largest proper divisor is 2_d = 10_b is a substring and 4 is not prime. a(2) = 55 since 55_d = 110111_b and its largest proper divisor is 11_d = 1011_b is a substring and 55 is not prime nor congruent to 0 (modulo either 2 or 3). a(4) = 407 since 407_d = 110010111_b and its largest proper divisor is 37_d = 100101_b is a substring and 407 is not prime nor congruent to 0 (modulo either 2, 3, 5, or 7).
