%N A077762 Number of ways of pairing the squares of the numbers 1 to n with the squares of the numbers n+1 to 2n such that each pair sums to a prime. Because an odd square must always be added to an even square to obtain a prime, this sequence is the product of A077763 and A077764.
%C A077762 Apparently, for n>11, there seems always to be a pairing possible. Note that all primes have the 4k+1 form. By the 4k+1 theorem, such a prime has a unique representation as the sum of two squares.

%F A077762 a(n) = permanent(m), where the n X n matrix m is defined by m(i,j) = 1 or 0, depending on whether i^2 + (j+n)^2 is prime or composite, respectively. - _T. D. Noe_, Feb 10 2007
%e A077762 a(5) = 2 because there are two ways: (1,4,9,16,25) + (36,49,100,81,64) = (37,53,109,97,89) and (1,4,9,16,25) + (100,49,64,81,36) = (101,53,73,97,61).
