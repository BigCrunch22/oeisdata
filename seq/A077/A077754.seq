%N A077754 Smallest multiple of n with two or more digits, none of them zeros, whose digit sum equals n, or 0 if no such multiple exists.
%C A077754 Equivalently, the digits of a(n) are a nontrivial composition of n and n divides a(n).
%C A077754 Conjecture: zero occurs only for indices which are multiples of 10 apart from 1, 2, 5 and 11. (a(n) = 0 only for n = 1,2,5,11 or n = 10k.)

%e A077754 a(8) = 152 is a multiple of 8; a(10) = 0, since every multiple of 10 includes a 0.
