%N A167219 Numbers k such that there exists a positive integer B for which k = Sum_{i=0..m} (B^i)*a_i where the a_i are defined by k = Product_{i=0..m} prime(i+1)^a_i.
%C A167219 Previous name: Numbers k such that there exists a solution to (p_m ^ a_m)*(p_m-1 ^ a_m-1)*...*(3^a_1)*(2^a_0) = (B^m)*a_m + (B^m-1)*a_m-1 + ... + (B^1)*a_1 + (B^0)*a_0 where k = (p_m ^ a_m)*(p_m-1 ^ a_m-1)*...*(3^a_1)*(2^a_0); a_m >= 1; a_(i<m) >= 0; p_0, p_1, ..., p_m are prime numbers; a_0, a_1, ..., a_m, B are integers.
%C A167219 B is the base in which we can express k as Sum_{i=0..m} B^i * a_i. B may also be seen as the variable in a polynomial, and k is then also an encoding of the polynomial (defined by the product of primes formula).
%C A167219 For k = (2^r)*3 we have B = (2^r)*3 - r.
%C A167219 A167221(n) is the smallest positive integer that yields a solution for k = a(n).
%C A167219 Negative B's can be obtained when the polynomial is an even function. This happens for instance when for k = 10, 100, 3125, ... - _Michel Marcus_, Aug 10 2022
%C A167219 From _Peter Munn_, Aug 13 2022: (Start)
%C A167219 Positive integers k such that k is a fixed point of a completely additive function f_B:N+ -> Z, B > 0, where f_B(prime(i+1)) = B^i for all i >= 0. Equivalently, since row B of A104244 is f_B, {a(n)} lists the columns of A104244 that contain their own column number.
%C A167219 If we require B to be negative instead, the sequence appears to start 10, 100, 3125, 1799875, 65610000, ... . Of these, 1799875 = 5^3 * 7 * 11^2 * 17 is the only k with only negative solutions (B = -11); the solutions for 65610000 are {4049, -4051}.
%C A167219 (End)
%C A167219 If p is the (k+1)-th prime and p is congruent to 1 modulo k, then p^p is a term with p^((p-1)/k) a solution for B. The list of such primes starts 3, 5, 7, 31, 97, 101, 331, ... . I suspect this list is infinite, meaning the greatest prime factor of the terms would be unbounded. - _Peter Munn_, Aug 15 2022

%e A167219 For k = 10 = 2^1 * 3^0 * 5^1, k = B^0 * 1 + B^1 * 0 + B^2 * 1, so we have to solve the equation 10 = 1 + B^2 for a positive integer B, B = 3. But B=-3 works too. Thus 10 is a term.
%e A167219 For k = 12 = 2^2 * 3^1, k = B^0 * 2 + B^1 * 1, so we have to solve the equation 12 = 2 + B for a positive integer B. B = 10. Thus 12 is a term.
%e A167219 For k = 21 = 2^0 * 3^1 * 5^0 * 7^1, k = B^0 * 0 + B^1 * 1 + B^2 * 0 + B^3 * 1, so we have to solve the equation 21 = B + B^3 for an integer B. No such B exists, so 21 is not a term of this sequence.

%e A167219 In other words:
%e A167219   10 is a term because 10 = 5^1 * 3^0 * 2^1 and 101 in base 3 is 10.
%e A167219   12 is a term because 12 = 3^1 * 2^2 and 12 in base 10 is 12. (End)
