%N A167509 Least positive integer written with n different letters when spelled out in French.
%C A167509 There is no number which can be written in French using only one letter, therefore the sequence starts at offset n=2, cf. examples.
%C A167509 A variant of the definition would be the "least nonnegative integer ....", in which case a(4)=0 ("zéro" with "accent aigu" on the "e"), all other terms remaining the same.
%C A167509 It appears that letters "j", "k" and "w" don't occur in any number, while "m" and "l" first occur in "mille" (=1000), and "b" first occurs in "billion".
%C A167509 If an "é" with accent (as it occurs in "décillion") is considered as different from "e" without accent, the sequence should have 26-3+1 terms.
%H A167509 Wiktionnaire, <a href="http://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/Annexe:Nombres_de_1_%C3%A0_100_en_fran%C3%A7ais">Annexe:Nombres de 1 à 100 en français</a> (as of Nov 18, 2009).
%F A167509 a(n) = min { k | A167508(k) = n }
%e A167509 The terms a(2),...a(14) correspond to the French words un, six, deux, trois, quatre, dix-sept, quatorze, vingt-deux, vingt-quatre, cinquante-trois, soixante-quatorze, quatre-vingt-douze, quatre-vingt-dix-sept.
%e A167509 Here, "vingt-quatre" is the first term which contains a letter occurring twice, and therefore has a length greater than n; we conjecture that this is the case for all subsequent terms.
%o A167509 (PARI) A167509(n) = { for( k=1,#A167508, A167508[k]==n & return(k)); error("Found no result for n="n) }
