%N A167451 Smallest sequence which lists the position of digits "9" in the sequence.
%C A167451 The lexicographically earliest sequence such that a(1),a(2),a(3),... is the (increasing) list of the positions of digits "9" in the string obtained by concatenating all these terms, written in base 10.
%e A167451 We cannot have a(1)=1 (since then there's no "9" in the first place), but a(1)=2 is possible.
%e A167451 This implies that a(2) must start with a digit "9", so a(2)=9 is the smallest possible choice.
%e A167451 This allows us to go on with a(3)=10, a(4)=11, a(5)=12, but then must be follow 4 digits "9" (the 9th through 12th digit of the sequence), so a(6)=99 and a(7)=990 are the smallest possible choices.
%e A167451 Then the reasoning continues in analogy with A167450-A167457.
