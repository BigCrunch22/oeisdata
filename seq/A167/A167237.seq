%N A167237 Lower trim of the Wythoff fractal sequence, A003603.
%C A167237 A fractal sequence: if you delete the first occurrence of each positive
%C A167237 integer, the remaining sequence is the original. This procedure is called
%C A167237 upper trimming, in contrast to lower trimming, which consists of
%C A167237 subtracting 1 from each term of the original fractal sequence and then
%C A167237 deleting all 0's. In general, the lower trim of a fractal sequence is a
%C A167237 fractal sequence; in particular, the lower trim of A003603 is A167237.

%F A167237 Although A167237 is closely associated with the Wythoff array (A035513)
%F A167237 and Fibonacci numbers (A000045), it can be constructed independently.
%F A167237 First, construct the fractal sequence of the Wythoff array inductively
%F A167237 as described at A003603; then subtract 1 from all terms and delete
%F A167237 all 0's.
