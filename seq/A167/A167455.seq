%N A167455 Smallest sequence which lists the position of digits "5" in the sequence.
%C A167455 The lexicographically earliest sequence such that a(1),a(2),a(3),... is the (increasing) list of the positions of digits "5" in the string obtained by concatenating all these terms, written in base 10.
%e A167455 We cannot have a(1)=1 (since then there's no "5" in the first place), but a(1)=2 is possible.
%e A167455 Then a(2) must start with a digit "5", so a(2)=5 is the smallest possible choice.
%e A167455 This allows us to go on with a(3)=6, a(4)=6, but then must be follow 3 digits "5" (the 5th, 6th and 7th digit of the sequence), so a(5)=55 and a(6)=56 are the smallest possible choice.
%e A167455 The reasoning continues in analogy with A167452-A167454.
