%N A167501 Sequence of bits in A167500 (= list of nonzero bits in this sequence, when written in binary).
%C A167501 Sequence A167500 starts 1,2,4,7,... = 1,10,100,111,.... when written in binary (A167502). This sequence lists the bits one by one, MSB first: 1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,...; by definition A167500 lists the nonzero terms of this function, and reciprocally this sequence is the characteristic function of A167500.
