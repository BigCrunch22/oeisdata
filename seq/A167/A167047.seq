%N A167047 Angry numbers: each number n must be more than n places from n-1 and n+1. This sequence makes each number as small as possible as it occurs.
%C A167047 This sequence is a permutation of the positive integers. A number cannot remain unassigned indefinitely; eventually the placement gets far enough from its neighbors and it gets used.
%C A167047 Each term in this sequence is either the next unused even number or the next unused odd number; after the initial 5 terms there are always 2 or 3 odd numbers between each pair of even numbers.
%e A167047 After a(1) = 1, we cannot have a(2) = 2, because then 1 and 2 would be too close. a(2) = 3 is OK. Now a(3) can't be 2 because then 2 and 3 would be too close; 4 would also be too close to 3, but 5 is OK. Skipping ahead, a(6) is the first place where 2 is not too close to 3, so a(6) = 2.
