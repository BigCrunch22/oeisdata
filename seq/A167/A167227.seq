%N A167227 Number of 2-self-hedrites with n vertices.
%C A167227 A 2-self-hedrite is a self-dual plane multigraph such that each its face has 4 sides except for 2 faces with 2 sides. - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Dec 16 2021

%F A167227 It appears that a(n+1) = A167156(2*n) - A167156(n) [discovered using Sequence Machine]. An equivalent assertion is that if a plane multigraph and its dual both have only 4-gonal faces except for 2 2-gonal ones, then they are isomorphic. - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Dec 16 2021
