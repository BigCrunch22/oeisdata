%N A167221 a(n) is the smallest positive number B that yields a solution for k = A167219(n).
%C A167221 B is the base in which we can express k as Sum_{i=0..m} B^i * a_i. There is an isomorphism between (Z[B],+) and the positive rationals as the polynomials with integer coefficients considered as a group under addition are isomorphic to the positive rationals considered as a group under multiplication.
%e A167221 For k = 21 = 2^0 * 3^1 * 5^0 * 7^1, k = B^0 * 0 + B^1 * 1 + B^2 * 0 + B^3 * 1, so we have to solve the equation 21 = B + B^3 for an integer B. No such B exists.
%e A167221 For k = 10 = 2^1 * 3^0 * 5^1, k = B^0 * 1 + B^1 * 0 + B^2 * 1, so we have to solve the equation 10 = 1 + B^2 for an integer B. B = +-3.
%e A167221 For k = 12 = 2^2 * 3^1, k = B^0 * 2 + B^1 * 1, so we have to solve the equation 12 = 2 + B for an integer B. B = 10. Are there any numbers other than k=12 for which B = 10 yields a solution?
