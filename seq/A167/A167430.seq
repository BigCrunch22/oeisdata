%N A167430 Fractal sequence of the interspersion A163255.
%C A167430 Both the upper trim and the lower trim of A167430 are identical to A167430.
%C A167430 (The upper trim of a fractal sequence s is what remains after the first
%C A167430 occurrence of each term is deleted; the lower trim of s is what remains
%C A167430 after all 0's are deleted from the sequence s-1.)
%F A167430 The sequence is formed by concatenating rows:
%F A167430 Row 1: ... 1 2
%F A167430 Row 2: ... 1 3 2 4
%F A167430 Row 3: ... 1 3 5 2 4 6
%F A167430 Row n comes from row n-1 by putting 2n-1 just before 2 and 2*n
%F A167430 just after 2n-2.
%Y A167430 Cf. A002260, A163255.
