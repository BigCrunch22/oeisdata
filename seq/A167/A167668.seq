%S A167668 0,42,6008,22738
%N A167668 Nonnegative integers n such that n^j doesn't contain the digit j (1<=j<=7) and n is not a multiple of a smaller member of the sequence.
%C A167668 If multiples could appear in the sequence, then 10^x * 22738 would also be in the sequence.
%C A167668 I've tested the integers up to 100000000. I believe 22738 is the greatest integer with this property, but I don't have a proof.
%C A167668 Similarly, I think there's no integer with the same property up to 8, but again, I have no proof of this.
%e A167668 Example : 22738 is in the sequence, because
%e A167668 The digit 1 doesn't appear in 22738^1
%e A167668 The digit 2 doesn't appear in 22738^2 = 517016644
%e A167668 The digit 3 doesn't appear in 22738^3 = 11755924451272
%e A167668 The digit 4 doesn't appear in 22738^4 = 267306210173022736
%e A167668 The digit 5 doesn't appear in 22738^5 = 6078008606914190971168
%e A167668 The digit 6 doesn't appear in 22738^6 = 138201759704014874302417984
%e A167668 The digit 7 doesn't appear in 22738^7 = 3142431612149890211888380120192
