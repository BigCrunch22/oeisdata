%N A167152 Lexicographically earliest injective sequence such that a(n) = A007953(a(a(n))), where A007953 = sum of digits (in base 10).
%C A167152 "Lexicographically earliest" means that the sequence is constructed by choosing a(n) to be the smallest positive integer not leading to a contradiction; "injective" means that a number may occur only once, and is thereafter excluded from the possible choices for subsequent terms.
%C A167152 Open problems: (1) Prove that a(n) > n for all n > 9.
%C A167152 (2) Prove that the subsequence of terms not ending in "9" is strictly increasing.
%C A167152 (3) Prove the given formula for a(n).
%C A167152 (4) Find an explicit formula for indices n where a(n) = m*10^k - 1.

%F A167152 If n < 10 or n is in { a(1), ..., a(n-1) }, then a(n) = (n mod 9 + 1)*10^floor(n/9) - 1 (= n for n < 10).
%F A167152 Otherwise, a(n) = n+1 unless n+1 occurred earlier in the sequence (and therefore is of the form k*10^m - 1), in which case a(n) = n+2 (conjectured).
