%e A167163 a(2) = 3, because in generating A167161, the number 2 is catapulted 3 times (first by 1, then by 3, and finally by 6).
%Y A167163 Cf. A167161 The Catapult Sequence.
%Y A167163 Cf. A167162 The inverse permutation (conjectured) of A167161.
%Y A167163 Cf. A167164 number catapulted by n in generation of A167161.
%Y A167163 Cf. A167165 total distance which n is catapulted in generation of A167161.
