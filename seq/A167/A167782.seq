%N A167782 Numbers that are repdigits with length > 2 in some base.
%C A167782 Definition requires "length > 2" because all numbers n > 2 are trivially represented as "11" in base n-1.
%C A167782 0 included at the suggestion of Franklin T. Adams-Watters (and others) as 0 = 000 in any base.
%C A167782 From _Daniel Forgues_, Nov 13 2009: (Start)
%C A167782 0 = 00 = 000 = 0000 = 00000 = 000000 = 0000000 = 00000000 = ... in any positional number representation (includes fixed base radix b > 1, mixed base radix with each b_i > 1, i >= 0, such as factorial and primorial based radix...)
%C A167782 The sequence definition should be read as:
%C A167782 Nonnegative integers that are repdigits with length > 2 in at least one fixed base radix b > 1.
%C A167782 Considering all fixed and mixed base radix would include many more nonnegative integers (but not the integers 1 to 6) which are repdigits with length > 2. (End)
