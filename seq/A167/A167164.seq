%N A167164 The number which is "catapulted" by n in the generation of the Catapult Sequence (A167161).
%C A167164 Whether or not this sequence is defined for all n depends on whether or not A167161 is a true permutation of the nonnegative integers (see comments under A167161).

%e A167164 a(2) = 12, because in the generation of the A167161, 2 eventually catapults 12.
%Y A167164 Cf. A167161 The Catapult Sequence.
%Y A167164 Cf. A167162 The inverse permutation (conjectured) of A167161.
%Y A167164 Cf. A167163 number of times n is catapulted in generation of A167161.
%Y A167164 Cf. A167165 total distance which n is catapulted in generation of A167161.
