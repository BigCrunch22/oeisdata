%N A167165 Total distance which n is "catapulted" in the generation of the Catapult Sequence (A167161).
%C A167165 Whether or not this sequence is defined for all n depends on whether or not A167161 is a true permutation of the nonnegative integers (see comments under A167161).

%e A167165 a(2) = 10, because 2 is catapulted by 1, 3, and 6 for a total distance of 1+3+6 = 10.
%Y A167165 Cf. A167161 The Catapult Sequence.
%Y A167165 Cf. A167162 The inverse permutation (conjectured) of A167161.
%Y A167165 Cf. A167163 number of times n is catapulted in generation of A167161.
%Y A167165 Cf. A167164 number catapulted by n in generation of A167161.
