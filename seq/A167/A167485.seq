%N A167485 Smallest positive integer m such that n can be expressed as the sum of an initial subsequence of the divisors of m, or 0 if no such m exists.
%C A167485 It appears that 2 and 5 are the only zeros in this sequence. This would follow from a slightly stronger version of the Goldbach conjecture: every even integer > 22 can be expressed as the sum of two primes p and q, with 5 < p < q < 5p. Then odd numbers can be obtained for pq and even numbers for 5pq.

%e A167485 The divisors of 15 are 1,3,5,15, with cumulative sums 1,4,9,24. Since this is the smallest number where 9 occurs in the sums, a(9) = 15.
