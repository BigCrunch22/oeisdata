%T A154329 497,498
%N A154329 Indices n where self-describing sequence A154328 has jumps, A154328(n) > A154328(n-1)+1.
%C A154329 The next term is on the order of 10^17, since the next constraint is A154328(27) = 10^19 = sum of the first 10^19 digits of A154328. Even if from term 500 on there were 30 digits "9" in each term, their sum would stay below 10^19 for more than 3*10^16 terms. But at index 498+10^12, the value of 10^31 is reached and among the next 10^17 terms, about half of the digits will be zero.
%e A154329 a(1)=2 since the 1st jump of A154328 occurs at index 2, where the value rises to A154328(2)=10 > A154328(1)+1=2.
%e A154329 a(2)=5 since the 2nd jump of A154328 occurs at index 5, where the value rises to A154328(5)=20 > A154328(4)+1=13.
