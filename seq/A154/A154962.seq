%N A154962 The terms of this sequence are integer values of consecutive denominators (with signs) from the fractional expansion (using only fractions with numerators to be positive 1's) of the BBP polynomial ( 4/(8*k+1) - 2/(8*k+4) - 1/(8*k+5) - 1/(8*k+6) ) for all k (starting from 0 to infinity); for k>=1 the Erdos-Straus conjecture is applied to the first fraction - so it is always replaced by exactly three fractions.
%C A154962 This sequence is different from A154925, where the first fraction for k>=1 is expanded with Egyptians fractions, using R.Knott's converter calculator #1 (http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fractions/egyptian.html#calc1)
