%N A154925 The terms of this sequence are integer values of consecutive denominators (with signs) from the fractional expansion (using only fractions with numerators to be positive 1's) of the BBP polynomial ( 4/(8*k+1) - 2/(8*k+4) - 1/(8*k+5) - 1/(8*k+6) ) for all k (starting from 0 to infinity).
%C A154925 The Egyptian fraction expansion is applied to the first fraction (that is 4/(8*k+1) ) of the BBP polynomial ( 4/(8*k+1) - 2/(8*k+4) - 1/(8*k+5) - 1/(8*k+6) ) for k>=1 - R.Knott's converter calculator #1 (http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fractions/egyptian.html#calc1) is used for such conversion. Note that in the case of k=0, 4/(8*k+1) comes to 4 and could be trivially expressed as 1/1 + 1/1 + 1/1 + 1/1 . It remains to be seen how above described Pi presentation relates to the Engel's presentation of Pi, which also consists of the infinite sum of fractions, whose numerators are all 1's.
%e A154925 For n = 7 the a(7) = 3 because for the k=1 the 4/(8*k+1) comes to 4/9=1/3+1/9, thus the first (smallest) denominator is 3 so a(7)=3 For n = 8 the a(8) = 9 because for the k=1 the 4/(8*k+1) comes to 4/9=1/3+1/9 and the second (next to smallest) denominator is 9 so a(8)=9 .
