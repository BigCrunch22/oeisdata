%N A154257 Number of triples <p,s,t> such that p+F_s+F_t=n, where p is an odd prime, s and t are greater than one and the Fibonacci number F_s or F_t is odd.
%C A154257 On Dec 23 2008, _Zhi-Wei_ Sun made a conjecture that states that a(n)>0 for all n=5,6,... (i.e., any integer n>4 can be written as the sum of an odd prime, an odd Fibonacci number and a positive Fibonacci number). This has been verified for n up to 10^14 by _D. S. McNeil_; the conjecture looks more difficult than the Goldbach conjecture since Fibonacci numbers are much more sparse than prime numbers. Sun also conjectured that c=lim inf_n a(n)/log n is greater than 2 and smaller than 3.
%C A154257 _Zhi-Wei Sun_ has offered a monetary reward for settling this conjecture.
