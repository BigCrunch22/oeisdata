%N A154777 Numbers of the form x^2 + 2*y^2 with positive integers x and y.
%C A154777 Subsequence of A002479 (which allows for x=0 and/or y=0). See there for further references. See A155560 cf for intersection of sequences of type (x^2 + k*y^2).
%C A154777 Also, subsequence of A000408 (with 2*y^2 = y^2 + z^2).
%C A154777 If m and n are terms also n*m is (in particular any power of term is also a term). - _Zak Seidov_, Nov 30 2011
%C A154777 If m is a term, 2*m is also. - _Zak Seidov_, Nov 30 2011
%C A154777 Select terms that are multiples of 25: 75, 150, 225, 275, 300, 425, 450, 475, 550, 600, 675, 825, 850, 900, 950, 1025, 1075, 1100, ... Divide them by 25: 3, 6, 9, 11, 12, 17, 18, 19, 22, 24, 27, 33, 34, 36, 38, 41, 43, 44, 48, 51, 54, 57, 59, 66, 67, 68, 72, ... and we get the original sequence. - _Zak Seidov_, Dec 01 2011
%C A154777 This sequence is closed under multiplication because A002479 is. - _Jerzy R Borysowicz_, Jun 13 2020

%e A154777 a(1) = 3 = 1^2 + 2*1^2 is the least number that can be written as A + 2B where A, B are positive squares.
%e A154777 a(2) = 6 = 2^2 + 2*1^2 is the second smallest number that can be written in this way.
