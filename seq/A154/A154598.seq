%N A154598 a(n) is the smallest prime p such that p-1 and p+1 both have n prime factors (with multiplicity).
%C A154598 Factors are counted with multiplicity. Sequence begins at a(2) since no prime p exists such that the adjacent numbers p-1 and p+1 have just one factor. For p = 2, p-1 has zero factors; for p >= 3, p+1 has at least two factors.

%e A154598 For p = 19, p-1 = 18 = 2*3*3 and p+1 = 20 = 2*2*5 both have three factors and 19 is the smallest such prime. For p = 271, p-1 = 270 = 2*3*3*3*5 and p+1 = 272 = 2*2*2*2*17 both have five factors and 271 is the smallest prime surrounded by numbers with five factors.
%e A154598 For p = 89, p-1 = 88 = 2*2*2*11 and p+1 = 90 = 2*3*3*5 both have four factors and 89 is the smallest such prime. For p = 1889, p-1 = 1888 = 2*2*2*2*2*59 and p+1 = 1890 = 2*3*3*3*5*7 both have six factors and 1889 is the smallest prime surrounded by numbers with six factors.
