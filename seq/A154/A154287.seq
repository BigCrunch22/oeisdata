%N A154287 (L)-sieve transform of {1,4,9,16,...,n^2,...}=A000290.
%C A154287 See A152009 for the definition of the (L)-sieve transform.
%C A154287 It appears that the first difference of {a(n)} starts with 2, followed by two occurrences of each consecutive integer except for the powers of 2, which occur only once, i.e. (2,3,3,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,9,9,...}. This has been verified for several hundred terms.
