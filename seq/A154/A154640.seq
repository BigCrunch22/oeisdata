%N A154640 a(n) is the number of spheres that are added in the n-th generation of Apollonian packing of three-dimensional spheres, starting with five mutually tangent spheres and using "strategy (a)" to count them (see the reference).
%C A154640 In strategy (a) we do not count spheres that are generated (by reflection) from quintuples that were not generated in the previous generation.

%e A154640 For a(3), we apply reflection only to the 20 quintuples that were generated in the second generation, ignoring the 10 "extra" quintuples (which will appear as ABA = BAB in the third generation).
%Y A154640 For other sequences relating to the 3-dimensional case, see A154638-A154645.
