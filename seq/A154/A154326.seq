%N A154326 Square array T(n,k) = min{j>=0 | f(j+1) is prime}, where f(0)=prime(n), f(1)=k, f(j+1)=f(j)+f(j-1); or 0 if there is no such j>=0. Read by antidiagonals, n>=1, k>=0.
%C A154326 Consider the Fibonacci sequence f(j+1)=f(j)+f(j-1) starting with f(0)=prime(n) and some f(1)=k>=0. Count how many nonprimes follow after the initial prime f(0), before the next prime term. Obviously, if f(1) is a positive multiple of f(0), then all following terms are positive multiples of f(0) and therefore composite; in this case we set T(n,k)=0.
%C A154326 This is somehow complementary to the search of primes in arithmetic progression, where one looks for the length of chains of prime terms.
%e A154326 The square array is:
%e A154326 n ( p) k=0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
%e A154326 1 ( 2) : 1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,...
%e A154326 2 ( 3) : 1,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,...
%e A154326 3 ( 5) : 1,2,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,1,0,0,...
%e A154326 4 ( 7) : 1,3,0,0,1,0,1,0,2,3,1,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,2,0,2,...
%e A154326 5 (11) : 1,2,0,0,2,0,1,0,1,2,2,0,1,0,4,2,2,0,1,0,1,... etc.
%e A154326 The entry of the array is the least index >= 0 after which a prime is reached, in the Fibonacci sequence f(0)=p=prime(n), f(1)=k, f(j+1)=f(j)+f(j-1).
%e A154326 For n=4 (f(0)=prime(4)=7), k=0 yields f=(7,0,7,7,14,....): T(n,k)=1 nonprime (0), f(1+1)=7 is prime.
%e A154326 k=1 yields f=(7,1,8,9,17,....): T(n,k)=3 nonprimes (1,8,9), f(3+1)=17 is prime.
%e A154326 k=2 yields f=(7,2,9,11,....): T(n,k)=0 nonprimes, since f(0+1)=2 is already prime.
