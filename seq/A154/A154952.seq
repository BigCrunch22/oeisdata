%N A154952 Index of first occurrence of n in A154404.
%C A154952 A related problem is to determine the index of the last occurrence of n in A154404. Among the first 10^6 terms in A154404, the values 0, 1, 2 and 3 last occur at indices 4, 5, 6 and 8, respectively, but all values larger than 3 that occur at all (4 through 56 and 58 through 61) do so at least once beyond the 500000th term.
%C A154952 The value 4, after its initial occurrence in A154404 at n=12, does not reoccur until n=666393. (The 4 ways to reach 666393 as a sum of an odd prime, a positive Fibonacci number and a Catalan number are 605023+2584+58786, 606997+610+58786, 607573+34+58786 and 648677+17711+5.)
%e A154952 a(4) = 12 because 12 is the smallest number that can be expressed in exactly 4 ways as the sum of an odd prime, a positive Fibonacci number and a Catalan number. (The 4 ways are 3+8+1, 5+2+5, 5+5+2 and 7+3+2.)
