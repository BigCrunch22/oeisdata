%N A154639 a(n) is the number of reduced words of length n (i.e., all possible length-reducing cancellations have been applied) in the generators of the "Apollonian reflection group" in three dimensions. This is a Coxeter group with five generators, satisfying the identities (S_i)^2 = (S_i S_j)^3 = I.
%C A154639 ABA and BAB are equal, but are counted as distinct reduced words.

%e A154639 All 80 squarefree words of length 3 are counted, so a(3) = 80.
%Y A154639 For other sequences relating to the 3-dimensional case, see A154638-A154645.
