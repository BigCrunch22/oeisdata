%N A154704 a(n) = smallest number k such that k-1 and k+1 both have n prime divisors (counted with multiplicity).
%C A154704 Similar to A154598, where k is restricted to primes.
%e A154704 For k = 4, k-1 = 3 and k+1 = 5 (twin primes) both have one factor and 4 is the smallest such number.
%e A154704 For k = 55, k-1 = 54 = 2*3*3*3 and k+1 = 56 = 2*2*2*7 both have four factors and 55 is the smallest such number.
%e A154704 For k = 59777, k-1 = 59776 = 2*2*2*2*2*2*2*467 and k+1 = 59778 = 2*3*3*3*3*3*3*41 both have eight factors and 59777 is the smallest such number.
