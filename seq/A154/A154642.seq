%N A154642 a(n) is the ratio of the sum of the squares of the bends of the spheres that are added in the n-th generation of Apollonian packing of three-dimensional spheres, using "strategy (a)" to count them (see the reference), to the sum of the squares of the bends of the initial five mutually tangent spheres.
%C A154642 In strategy (a) we do not count spheres that can be obtained (by reflection) from the "extra" quintuples of spheres that appear in the previous generation.

%e A154642 Starting with five spheres with bends 0,0,1,1,1, the first derived generation has 5 spheres with bends 1,1,1,3,3, so a(2) = 9/3 = 3.
%Y A154642 For other sequences relating to the 3-dimensional case, see A154638-A154645.
