%N A238266 a(n) is the largest number that can be written in the form a(n) = 2^k1 * p1^k2 + 2^k3 * p2^k4 in n distinct ways, where p1 and p2 are odd prime numbers and k1, k2, k3, and k4 are nonnegative integers.
%C A238266 It is conjectured that, for any positive integer n, there exist only a finite number of positive integers that can be written in the form 2^k1 * p1^k2 + 2^k3 * p2^k4 in n distinct ways.
%C A238266 The Mathematica program used to generate the first 57 terms tested integers up to 3104, about four times the maximum value of the 57 terms.  There is no proof that this condition is sufficient.
%C A238266 The terms in the b-file were confirmed up to 500000; for each value of n in 1..710, there is no larger number, up to 500000, than the one listed in the b-file that can be written in the defined form in exactly n ways.
