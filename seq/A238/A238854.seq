%N A238854 Largest right-truncatable, reversible prime in base n.
%C A238854 See A238850, A238851, A238852, A238853 for the finite lists of such numbers in four bases selected as examples. A sequence conceptually similar to this one, but for right-truncatable (not reversible!) primes is A023107. The present, more restrictive, condition leads to smaller numbers which can be evaluated in reasonable time for much higher n values.

%e A238854 a(4) = 53 because it is a prime which in base 4 reads 311_b4, its reverse 113_b4 (decimal 23) is also a prime, the same holds for all its base-4 prefixes (31_b4 and 3_b4), and it is the largest natural having these properties.
