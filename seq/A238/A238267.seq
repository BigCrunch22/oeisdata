%N A238267 The number of integers that can be written in the form 2^k1 * p1^k2 + 2^k3 * p2^k4 in n distinct ways, where p1 and p2 are odd prime numbers and k1, k2, k3, and k4 are nonnegative integers.
%C A238267 It is conjectured that a(n) > 0 for all n > 0.
%C A238267 The Mathematica program used to generate the first 74 terms tested integers up to 5048, about four times the maximum number that was found to have fewer than 75 ways as defined.
%C A238267 The establishment of this sequence depends on A238266, which limits the search range of this sequence.
%C A238267 The b-file is calculated by evaluating integers from 1 to 500000, more than 12 times the maximum number that can be written in the defined form in no more than 710 ways, as of A238266.

%e A238267 A238263(2)=A238263(3)=1; these two numbers, 2 and 3, are the only numbers that can be written in the defined form in only one way, so a(1)=2.
%e A238267 ...
%e A238267 A238263(50)=A238263(51)=...=A238263(71)=18; 8 numbers, {50, 51, 55, 58, 59, 61, 67, 71}, were found to have 18 ways to be written in the defined form, so a(18)=8.
