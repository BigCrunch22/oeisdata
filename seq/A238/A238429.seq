%N A238429 Expansion of F(x) where F(x) = 1 + x / (1 - x^2 / F(x^2) ).
%C A238429 The sequence of nonzero terms is (apart from the term a(1)=1 here) the same as that for A218031, see the formula "F(x) - x = A(x^3)".
%F A238429 G.f.: F(x) = 1+x/ (1-x^2/ (1+x^2/ (1-x^4/ (1+x^4 /(1-x^8/ (1+x^8/ (1-x^16/ ... ))))))) (continued fraction).
%F A238429 F(x) - x = A(x^3) where A(x) is the g.f. of A218031. Note that for G(x) = F(x) - x we have G(x) = 1 + x^3/G(x^2) = 1 + x^3/(1 + x^6 / G(x^2) ) = ... = 1 + x^3/(1 + x^6 / (1 + x^12 / (1 + x^24 / (...) ) ) ) = A(x^3).
