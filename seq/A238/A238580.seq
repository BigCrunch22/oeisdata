%C A238580 Note that a prime p with p + 2 a product of at most two primes is called a Chen prime.

%e A238580 a(7) = 1 since 2*3 + 1 = 7 and prime(3)*prime(7) - 2 = 5*17 - 2 = 83 are both prime.
%e A238580 a(8) = 1 since 2*8 + 1 = 17 and prime(8)*prime(8) - 2 = 19^2 - 2 = 359 are both prime.
%e A238580 a(77) = 1 since 2*20 + 1 = 41 and prime(20)*prime(77) - 2 = 71*389 - 2 = 27617 are both prime.
