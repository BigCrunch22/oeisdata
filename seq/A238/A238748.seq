%N A238748 Numbers n such that each integer that appears in the prime signature of n appears an even number of times.
%C A238748 Values of n for which all numbers in row A238747(n) are even. Also, numbers n such that A000005(n^m) is a perfect square for all nonnegative integers m; numbers n such that A181819(n) is a perfect square; numbers n such that A182860(n) is odd.

%e A238748 The prime signature of 36 = 2^2 * 3^2 is {2,2}. One distinct integer (namely, 2) appears in the prime signature, and it appears an even number of times (2 times). Hence, 36 appears in the sequence.
%e A238748 The prime factorization of 1260 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^1 * 7^1. Exponent 2 occurs twice (an even number of times), as well as exponent 1, thus 1260 is included. It is also the first term k > 1 in this sequence for which A182850(k) = 4, not 3.
