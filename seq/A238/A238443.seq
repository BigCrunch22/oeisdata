%C A238443 Column 1 of A240062.
%C A238443 First differs from A103288 and A125225 at a(23).
%C A238443 First differs from A005153 at a(24).
%C A238443 The only odd number is 1.

%C A238443 From _Hartmut F. W. Hoft_, Jul 07 2014: (Start)
%C A238443 Conjecture #1: The numbers n for which there is exactly one part in the symmetric representation of sigma(n) and whose width is one unit square are exactly the powers of two, A000079. (True)
%C A238443 Conjecture #2: The numbers n for which there is exactly one part in the symmetric representation of sigma(n) and whose width is one unit square except at the midpoint are exactly the perfect numbers, A000396. (True)
%C A238443 (End)
%C A238443 For proofs of the two conjectures see the links.
%C A238443 [In view of the length of this entry, it seems worth keeping both this sequence and A174973 in the OEIS, rather than trying to merge them. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Jan 15 2015]
%C A238443 For a symmetric representation of the sum of the divisors of a(n) see A317305. - _Omar E. Pol_, Dec 02 2022

%e A238443 The symmetric representation of sigma(6) = 12 in the first quadrant looks like this:

%e A238443 .
%e A238443 6 is in the sequence because the symmetric representation of sigma(6) = 12 has only one part. The 6th row of A237593 is [4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4] and the 5th row of A237593 is [3, 2, 2, 3] therefore between both symmetric Dyck paths there is only one region (or part) of size 12.
%e A238443 70 is not in the sequence because the symmetric representation of sigma(70) = 144 has three parts. The 70th row of A237593 is [36, 12, 6, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, 36] and the 69th row of A237593 is [35, 12, 7, 4, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 7, 12, 35] therefore between both symmetric Dyck paths there are three regions (or parts) of size [54, 36, 54].
