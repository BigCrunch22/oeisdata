%N A238945 Number of partitions of n that have even-sized Ferrers matrix.
%C A238945 Also, the number of even numbers in row n of the array at A238943.  Suppose that p is a partition of n, and let m = max{greatest part of p, number of parts of p}.  Write the Ferrers graph of p with 1's as nodes, and pad the graph with 0's to form an m X m square matrix, which is introduced at A237981 as the Ferrers matrix of p, denoted by f(p).  The size of f(p) is m.
%F A238945 a(n) + A238944(n) = A000041(n).
