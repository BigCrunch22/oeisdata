%N A238478 Number of partitions of n whose median is a part.
%C A238478 Also the number of integer partitions of n with a unique middle part. This means that either the length is odd or the two middle parts are equal. For example, the partition (4,3,2,1) has middle parts {2,3} so is not counted under a(10), but (3,2,2,1) has middle parts {2,2} so is counted under a(8). - _Gus Wiseman_, May 13 2023
%F A238478 a(n) + A238479(n) = A000041(n).
%F A238478 For all n, a(n) >= A027193(n) (because when a partition of n has an odd number of parts, its median is simply the part at the middle). - _Antti Karttunen_, Feb 27 2014
%F A238478 a(n) = A078408(n-1) - A282893(n). - _Mathew Englander_, May 24 2023
%e A238478 a(6) counts these partitions:  6, 411, 33, 321, 3111, 222, 21111, 111111.

%Y A238478 For mean instead of median we have A237984, ranks A327473.
%Y A238478 The complement is counted by A238479, ranks A362617.
%Y A238478 These partitions have ranks A362618.
%Y A238478 A000041 counts integer partitions.
%Y A238478 A325347 counts partitions with integer median, complement A307683.
%Y A238478 A359893/A359901/A359902 count partitions by median.
%Y A238478 A359908 ranks partitions with integer median, complement A359912.
