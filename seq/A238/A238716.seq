%N A238716 Run lengths of decadal prime triples.
%C A238716 Length of runs of "consecutive" (step = 3) values in A008470, which lists "prime triple decades", i.e., numbers m>1 such that the interval (10m,10m+10) contains at least 3 primes. The decades must be of the form m=3k+1, since for m=3k, 10m+3 and 10m+9 cannot be prime and for m=3k+2, 10k+1 and 10k+7 cannot be prime. Thus, "consecutive" prime triples are meant here in the sense of consecutive k-values.
%e A238716 The first occurrence of 5 consecutive triples is: {11, 13, 17 (or 19)} ; {41, 43, 47} ; {71, 73, 79} ; {101, 103, 107 (or 109)} ; {131, 137, 139}. This corresponds to decades 1,4,7,10,13; i.e., the first 5 terms of sequence A008470. Therefore, a(1)=5.
%e A238716 The next "decadal prime triples" start at A238713(6)=191 and A238713(7)=223, they form the next run of length a(2)=2, since the decades A008470(6)=19 and A008470(7)=22 differ by the minimum which is 3, but the next one is further away.
%e A238716 The next term A238713(8)=311 starts an "isolated" decadal prime triple, i.e., the next "run" of length a(3)=1.
%e A238716 The next run of length 4 starts with decade m=541, and the next occurrence of 5 consecutive triples starts with decade m=910052463685 (found by J. K. Andersen).
