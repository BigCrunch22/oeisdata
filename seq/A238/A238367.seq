%N A238367 Even numbers n such that n is not divisible by 2^d where d is the number of distinct odd prime factors of n.
%C A238367 Inspired by comment by _Don Reble_ in A072995.
%C A238367 2*A061346 = A238367 with the exceptions of 420, 660, 780, 924, 1020, 1092, 1140, 1260, ... .
%e A238367 30 is in the sequence because the odd primes that divide 30 are 3 and 5, but 2^2 does not divide 30.
