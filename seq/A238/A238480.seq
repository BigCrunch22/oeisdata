%N A238480 Number of partitions p of n that include (min(p) + max(p))/2 as a part.
%C A238480 A238480(n) + A238481(n) = A000041(n).
%e A238480 a(6) counts these partitions:
%e A238480   6 (as (6+6)/2 = 6 is included),
%e A238480   33 (as (3+3)/2 = 3 is included),
%e A238480   321 (as (3+1)/2 = 2 is included),
%e A238480   222 (as (2+2)/2 = 2 is included),
%e A238480   111111 (as (1+1)/2 = 1 is included).
%e A238480 Thus a(6) = 5.
%t A238480 Table[Count[IntegerPartitions[n], p_ /; MemberQ[p, (Min[p] + Max[p])/2]], {n, 40}]
