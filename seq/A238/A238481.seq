%N A238481 Number of partitions p of n that do not include (min(p) + max(p))/2 as a part.
%F A238481 A238480(n) + A238481(n) = A000041(n).
%e A238481 a(6) counts these partitions:
%e A238481   51 (as part (5+1)/2 = 3 is not included),
%e A238481   42 (as (4+2)/2 = 3 is not included),
%e A238481   411 (as (4+1)/2 = 2.5 cannot be included),
%e A238481   3111 (as (3+1)/2 = 2 is not included),
%e A238481   2211 (as (2+1)/2 = 1.5 cannot be included),
%e A238481   21111 (ditto).
%e A238481 Thus a(6) = 6.
%t A238481 Table[Count[IntegerPartitions[n], p_ /; !MemberQ[p, (Min[p] + Max[p])/2]], {n, 40}]
