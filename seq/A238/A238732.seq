%N A238732 Number of primes p < n with floor((n-p)/3) a square.
%C A238732 Conjecture: (i) For any integers m > 2 and n > 2, there is a prime p < n such that floor((n-p)/m) is a square.
%C A238732 (ii) For any integer k > 2, if m and n are sufficiently large, then there is a prime p < n such that floor((n-p)/m) is a k-th power. In particular, for any integer n > 2, there is a prime p < n such that floor((n-p)/5) is a cube.
%C A238732 We have verified part (i) for m = 3, ..., 10 and n = 3, ..., 10^6.

%e A238732 a(3) = 1 since 2 is prime with floor((3-2)/3) = 0^2.
%e A238732 a(11) = 1 since 7 is prime with floor((11-7)/3) = 1^2.
%e A238732 a(13) = 1 since 13 is prime with floor((13-11)/3) = 0^2.
%e A238732 a(28) = 1 since 23 is prime with floor((28-23)/3) = 1^2.
%e A238732 a(37) = 1 since 23 is prime with floor((37-23)/3) = 2^2.
%e A238732 a(173) = 1 since 97 is prime with floor((173-97)/3) = 5^2.
%e A238732 It seems that a(n) = 1 only for n = 3, 11, 13, 28, 37, 173.
