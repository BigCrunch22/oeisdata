%N A238850 Right-truncatable reversible primes in base 10.
%C A238850 In a general base b, a number qualifies as a member iff: (i) it is a prime, (ii) when its digits in base b are reversed, it is still a prime, and (iii) when, in base b, it has more than one digit and the least significant one is dropped, the remaining prefix has the same properties. This implies that any base-b prefix of such a number, no matter how many right-side digits are truncated, is still a right-truncatable reversible prime. Sequences of this type appear to be all finite (see A238854, A238855, and A238856, used as examples).
%C A238850 This particular sequence is for base b = 10.

%Y A238850 In base 16: A238851, 100: A238852, 256: A238853.
%Y A238850 In base n: A238854 (largest), A238855 (totals), A238856 (maximum digits), A238857 (m-digit counts).
