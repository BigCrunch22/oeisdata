%N A238948 Start T with a(1)=1 and a(2)=2. We try to set a(n) to be the sum s of the last two decimal digits of T, except that if s is already in the sequence, we replace s with the smallest unused integer that ends with the same digit as s.
%C A238948 This is not a permutation of the natural numbers; for instance, 100 (or any number ending in "100") does not appear in this sequence since the last two digits of S will never sum to 0, 00, or 100. - _Jim Nastos_, Mar 13 2014
