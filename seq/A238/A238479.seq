%N A238479 Number of partitions of n whose median is not a part.
%C A238479 Also, the number of partitions p of n such that (1/2)*max(p) is a part of p.

%F A238479 a(n) = A000041(n) - A238478(n).
%F A238479 For all n, A027187(n) >= a(n). [Because when a partition of n has an odd number of parts, then it is not counted by this sequence (cf. A238478) and also some of the partitions with an even number of parts might be excluded here. Cf. Examples.] - _Antti Karttunen_, Feb 27 2014
%F A238479 From _Jeremy Lovejoy_, Sep 29 2022: (Start)
%F A238479 G.f.: Sum_{n>=1} q^(3*n)/Product_{k=1..2*n} (1-q^k).
%F A238479 a(n) ~ Pi/(2^(17/4)*3^(3/4)*n^(5/4))*exp(Pi*sqrt(2*n/3)). Proved by Blecher and Knopfmacher. (End)
%e A238479 a(6) counts these partitions:  51, 42, 2211 which all have an even number of parts, and their medians 3, 3 and 1.5 are not present. Note that the partitions 33 and 3111, although having an even number of parts, are not included in the count of a(6), but instead in that of A238478(6), as their medians, 3 for the former and 1 for the latter, are present in those partitions.
