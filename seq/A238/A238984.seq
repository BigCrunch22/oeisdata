%N A238984 a(n+1) is the product of the last three digits of the sequence up to a(n), start with a(0)=2.
%C A238984 Additional rule: if there are fewer than k=3 digits in the sequence so far, then it is "extended to the left" with the first digit (i.e., that digit is repeated as often as necessary).
%C A238984 For any starting value, the sequence obtained through these rules ends either in repeating 0's, or in repeating 1's, or in the cycle (16,48,192,18). So 2 is the least starting value for which this nontrivial cycle is entered, after 5 iterations, at a(5)=192.
%H A238984 E. Angelini, <a href="http://list.seqfan.eu/oldermail/seqfan/2014-August/013413.html">Multiplication by themselves of the last k digits</a>.
%F A238984 a(n+4)=a(n) for n > 4.
%e A238984 a(1) = 2*2*2 = 8 (here the initial digit is used 3 times), a(2) = 2*2*8 = 32 (here the initial digit is used twice to get k=3 factors), a(3) = 8*3*2 = 48, ...
