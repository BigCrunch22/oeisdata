%N A238412 The multiplicative sum Zagreb index of the rooted tree with Matula number n (n >= 2).
%C A238412 The multiplicative sum Zagreb index of a graph is defined as the product of d(u) + d(v) over all edges uv of G, where d(w) denotes the degree of the vertex w.
%C A238412 The Matula-Goebel number of a rooted tree can be defined in the following recursive manner: to the one-vertex tree there corresponds the number 1; to a tree T with root degree 1 there corresponds the t-th prime number, where t is the Matula-Goebel number of the tree obtained from T by deleting the edge emanating from the root; to a tree T with root degree m>=2 there corresponds the product of the Matula-Goebel numbers of the m branches of T.

%F A238412 There are recurrence relations that give the multiplicative sum Zagreb index of an "elevated" rooted tree (attach a new vertex to the root which becomes the root of the new tree) and of the merge of two rooted trees (identify the two roots). They make use of the sequence of the degrees of the level 1 vertices (denoted by DL in the Maple program).
%e A238412 a(5)=36; indeed the rooted tree with Matula number 5 is the path PQRS (rooted at P). The edges PQ and RS have endpoints of degrees 1 and 2 and the edge QR has endpoints of degrees 2 and 2; consequently, the contributions of these 3 edges to the multiplicative sum Zagreb index are 3, 3, 4; 3*3*4 = 36. a(987654321) = 92501790267801600000; the corresponding tree is the 29-vertex tree given in Fig. 2 of the Deutsch reference.
