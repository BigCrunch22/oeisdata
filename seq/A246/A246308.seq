%N A246308 Number of ON cells at generation n of 2-D cellular automaton in which a cell is ON iff either 1, 2 or 3 of its eight neighbors were ON at previous generation, starting with a single ON cell.
%C A246308 This is the Rule 252 outer totalistic 8-neighbor 2-D CA.
%C A246308 The first few generations are easy to understand, but then there are complications (hence the keyword "look", which refers to the illustrations).
