%N A246080 Paradigm shift sequence for (0,2) production scheme with replacement.
%C A246080 This sequence is the solution to the following problem: "Suppose you have the choice of using one of three production options: apply a simple incremental action, bundle existing output as an integrated product (which requires p=0 steps), or implement the current bundled action (which requires q=2 steps). The first use of a novel bundle erases (or makes obsolete) all prior actions. How large an output can be generated in n time steps?"
%C A246080 1. A production scheme with replacement R(p,q) eliminates existing output following a bundling action, while an additive scheme A(p,q) retains the output. The schemes correspond according to A(p,q)=R(p-q,q), with the replacement scheme serving as the default presentation.
%C A246080 2. This problem is structurally similar to the Copy and Paste Keyboard problem: Existing sequences (A178715 and A193286) should be regarded as Paradigm-Shift Sequences with production schemes R(1,1) and R(2,1) with replacement, respectively.
%C A246080 3. The ideal number of implementations per bundle, as measured by the geometric growth rate (p+zq root of z), is z = 3.
%C A246080 4. All solutions will be of the form a(n) = (qm+r) * m^b * (m+1)^d.
