%N A246054 Numerators of the first rational corners of the mean-median map limit value m(x) for x >= 1/2.
%C A246054 The function m(x) is the limit value of the mean-median map. Start with 0<x<1 and find a new number x_4 so that the median of {0,x,1} equals the mean of {0,x,1,x_4}. Then find a new number x_5 so that the median of {0,x,1,x_4} equals the mean of {0,x,1,x_4,x_5}, etc. It is conjectured by Shultz and Shiflett that for all real x this process ends after finitely many steps. Cellarosi and Munday find a range of x for which this conjecture is true (improving results of Chamberland and Martelli), and an explicit piecewise affine formula for m(x). It is enough to study the case of 1/2 <= x <= 2/3. The first rational corners of the map m(x) to the right of 1/2 are found by Cellarosi and Munday and these are the rationals whose numerators are listed above.
