%N A246969 Erroneous version of A246970.
%C A246969 This is the "connected" version of the problem studied by Read in A001500. Since the terms a(6) and a(7) for A001500 given in his letter (and presumably also in his dissertation) are known to be wrong, it is extremely likely that the values of a(6) and a(7) shown here are also wrong.
