%N A246145 Index sequence for limit-block extending A000002 (Kolakoski sequence) with first term as initial block.
%C A246145 Suppose S = (s(0), s(1), s(2), ...) is an infinite sequence such that every finite block of consecutive terms occurs infinitely many times in S.  (It is assumed that A000002 is such a sequence.)  Let B = B(m,k) = (s(m), s(m+1),...s(m+k)) be such a block, where m >= 0 and k >= 0.  Let m(1) be the least i > m such that (s(i), s(i+1),...,s(i+k)) = B(m,k), and put B(m(1),k+1) = (s(m(1)), s(m(1)+1),...s(m(1)+k+1)).  Let m(2) be the least i > m(1) such that (s(i), s(i+1),...,s(i+k)) = B(m(1),k+1), and put B(m(2),k+2) = (s(m(2)), s(m(2)+1),...s(m(2)+k+2)).  Continuing in this manner gives a sequence of blocks B'(n) = B(m(n),k+n), so that for n >= 0, B'(n+1) comes from B'(n) by suffixing a single term; thus the limit of B'(n) is defined; we call it the "limiting block extension of S with initial block B(m,k)", denoted by S^  in case the initial block is s(0).
%C A246145 The sequence (m(i)), where m(0) = 0, is the "index sequence for limit-block extending S with initial block B(m,k)", as in A246128.  If the sequence S is given with offset 1, then the role played by s(0) in the above definitions is played by s(1) instead, as in the case of A246144 and A246145.
%C A246145 Limiting block extensions are analogous to limit-reverse sequences, S*, defined at A245920.  The essential difference is that S^ is formed by extending each new block one term to the right, whereas S* is formed by extending each new block one term to the left (and then reversing).
