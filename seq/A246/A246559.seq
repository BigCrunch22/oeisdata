%N A246559 List of one-sided polyominoes in binary coding, ordered by number of bits, then value of the binary code. Can be read as irregular table with row lengths A000988.
%C A246559 The binary coding (as suggested in a post to the SeqFan list by F. T. Adams-Watters) is obtained by summing the powers of 2 corresponding to the numbers covered by the polyomino, when the points of the quarter-plane are numbered by antidiagonals, and the animal is pushed to both borders as to obtain the smallest possible value. See example for further details.
%C A246559 The smallest value for an n-omino is the sum 2^0+...+2^(n-1) = 2^n-1 = A000225(n), and the largest value, obtained for the straight n-omino (in x direction), is 2^0+2^1+2^3+...+2^A000217(n-1) = A181388(n-1).

%e A246559 Number the points of the first quadrant as follows:
%e A246559 ...
%e A246559 9 ...
%e A246559 5 8 ...
%e A246559 2 4 7 ...
%e A246559 0 1 3 6 10 ...
%e A246559 The "empty" 0-omino is represented by the empty sum equal to 0 = a(1).
%e A246559 The monomino is represented by a square on 0, and the binary code 2^0 = 1 = a(2).
%e A246559 The dominos ".." and ":" would be represented by 2^0+2^1 = 3 and 2^0+2^2 = 5. Since they are equivalent up to rotation, only 3 = a(3) is listed.
%e A246559 The A000988(3) = 2 one-sided trominoes are represented by 2^0+2^1+2^3 = 11 (...) and 2^0+2^1+2^2 = 7 (:.). Again these values are listed in increasing size as a(4) and a(5).
