%N A246521 List of free polyominoes in binary coding, ordered by number of bits, then value of the binary code. Can be read as irregular table with row lengths A000105 (in which case the offset is 0).
%C A246521 The binary coding (as suggested in a post to the SeqFan list by F. T. Adams-Watters) is obtained by summing the powers of 2 corresponding to the numbers covered by the polyomino, when the points of the quarter-plane are numbered by antidiagonals, and the animal is placed (and flipped/rotated) as to obtain the smallest possible value, which in particular implies pushing it to both borders. See example for further details.
%C A246521 The smallest value for an n-omino is the sum 2^0 + ... + 2^(n-1) = 2^n - 1 = A000225(n), and the largest value, obtained for the straight n-omino, is 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^3 + ... + 2^A000217(n-1) = A181388(n-1).
%C A246521 See A246533 for the variant that lists fixed polyominoes.

%e A246521 An animal occupying squares numbered k1, ..., kN will be represented by a term a(n) = 2^k1 + ... + 2^kN, the position and orientation being chosen as to minimize this value:
%e A246521 The "empty" 0-omino is represented by the empty sum equal to 0 = a(1).
%e A246521 The monomino is represented by a square on 0, and the binary code 2^0 = 1 = a(2).
%e A246521 The free domino is rotated to the ".." configuration represented by 2^0 + 2^1 (since this is smaller than the ":" configuration with value 2^0 + 2^2).
%e A246521 The A000105(3) = 2 free triominoes are represented by 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^3 = [...] and 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 = [:.]. The latter value is smaller, therefore the L-shaped triomino is listed before the straight one.

%e A246521 Writing all N-ominoes on row N, the table begins:
%e A246521   N | a(m .. m+k), m = 1 + Sum_{j<N} A000105(j), k = A000105(N) - 1
