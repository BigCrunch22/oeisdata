%N A246548 Start of the least 5-tuple of consecutive squarefree numbers each of which has exactly n distinct prime factors.
%C A246548 By "consecutive squarefree numbers" we mean consecutive terms of A005117, not consecutive integers that also happen to be squarefree.
%e A246548 462807341, 462807343, 462807347, 462807349, and 462807353 are the smallest 5 primes that are also consecutive squarefree numbers, so a(1) = 462807341.
%e A246548 115, 118, 119, 122, and 123 are the smallest 5 semiprimes that are also consecutive squarefree numbers, so a(2) = 115.
%e A246548 6302, 6303, 6305, 6306, and 6307 is the smallest 5-tuple of consecutive squarefree numbers each of which has exactly 3 prime factors, so a(3) = 6302.
%Y A246548 Cf. A005117, A242621 (triple version), A246470 (quadruplet version), A246471.
