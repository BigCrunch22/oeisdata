%N A337701 Place two n-gons with radii 1 and 2 concentrically, forming an annular area between them. Connect all the vertices with line segments that lie entirely within that area. Then a(n) is the number of vertices in that figure.
%C A337701 Because of symmetry, a(n) is divisible by n.
%C A337701 See A337700 for illustrations.
