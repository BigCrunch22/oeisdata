%e A337095 a(1) = 5 is the sum of k>1 consecutive primes in exactly one way: 5 = 2+3;
%e A337095 a(2) = 17 is the sum of k>1 consecutive primes in exactly one way: 17 = 2+3+5+7;
%e A337095 a(3) = 23 is the sum of k>1 consecutive primes in exactly one way: 23 = 2+3+5+7+11;
%e A337095 a(4) = 31 is the sum of k>1 consecutive primes in exactly one way: 31 = 7+11+13;
%e A337095 a(5) = 53 is the sum of k>1 consecutive primes in exactly one way: 53 = 5+7+11+13+17; etc.
%e A337095 The prime number 41 is not in the sequence because 41 is the sum of k>1 consecutive primes in more than one way: 41 = 2+3+5+7+11+13 and 41 = 11+13+17).
