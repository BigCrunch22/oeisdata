%N A337272 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = number of initially connected tournaments on n elements with k primary ascents.
%C A337272 This continues the enumeration of certain tournaments from A337271.
%C A337272 A tournament on {1,...,n} is a digraph with arcs between i and j for each i<j; either i->j or i<-j. The arc is an "ascent" if i->j.
%C A337272 It is a "primary ascent" if it's an ascent for which i and j belong to the same "initially connected component".
%C A337272 The initially connected components of a tournament on {1,...,n} are defined as follows: One component consists of everything reachable from 1. Remove that component; the next component, if any vertices remain, consists of everything reachable from the smallest remaining vertex. And so on.
%C A337272 The rows of this triangle are the coefficients of the polynomials g[n] (or g(n)) defined in the Mma code.
%F A337272 See Mma code.
