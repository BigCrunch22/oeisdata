%N A337244 Perimeters of integer-sided triangles such that the harmonic mean of all the side lengths and the harmonic mean of each pair of side lengths is an integer.
%H A337244 Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_triangle">Integer Triangle</a>
%e A337244 6 is in the sequence since the integer-sided triangle [2,2,2] (with perimeter 6) has harmonic mean 3*2*2*2/(2*2+2*2+2*2) = 2 (an integer), and the harmonic mean of each pair of side lengths has harmonic mean 2*2*2/(2+2) = 2 (an integer).
%e A337244 14 is not in the sequence. Although each pair of side lengths in the integer triangle [2,6,6] (with perimeter 14) has an integer harmonic mean (i.e., 2*2*6/(2+6) = 3, 2*2*6/(2+6) = 3 and 2*6*6/(6+6) = 72/12 = 6), the harmonic mean of all the side lengths is 3*2*6*6/(2*6+2*6+6*6) = 216/60 = 18/5 (not an integer).
