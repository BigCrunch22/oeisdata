%N A337546 A binary sequence defined as follows: a(1)=0; thereafter choose a(n) so as to minimize the number of final consecutive repeated words, and if there is a choice, minimize the length of the repeated word.
%C A337546 Start with a(1)=0, then select a(n)=0 or a(n)=1 so as to minimize the largest integer T such that a(0),...,a(n) has a word repeated T times at the end, and if 0 and 1 produce the same T, so as to minimize the length of the longest word repeated T times at the end.
%C A337546 Cousin of the so-called Linus sequence (A006345), which avoids the longest repeated suffix. Conjectures: 1. This is cubefree (the Linus sequence is not cubefree); 2. density of 0's exists and equals 1/2; 3. recurrent and mirror invariant.
%C A337546 This has some similarities with Gijswijt's sequence A090822. - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Dec 21 2020

%e A337546 Consider the first case where the sequence differs from the Linus sequence, that is at n=20. Up to n=19 we have: 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0. Then inserting 0 produces a triple at the end, while inserting 1 produces two occurrences of the word 001 at the end and no cubes. Since the number of repetitions counts more than length of the repeated suffix, a(20)=1.
