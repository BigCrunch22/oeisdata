%N A337518 Number of non-isomorphic graphs on n unlabeled nodes modulo 3.
%C A337518 For the mod-2 case, the sequence is eventually constant, because there are an even number of graphs on n vertices for n>4. (In fact, the number of factors of 2 in A000088(n) is asymptotically n/2; see Cater and Robinson in the Links section.)

%F A337518 a(n) = A000088(n) mod 3.
%e A337518 For n = 4, there are 11 graphs on 4 nodes up to isomorphism, so a(4) = 2 = 11 mod 3.
