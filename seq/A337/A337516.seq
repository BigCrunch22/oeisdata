%N A337516 Number of distinct resistances that can be produced using n unit resistors in series, parallel, bridge or fork configurations.
%C A337516 Each network with 2, 3 or 4 resistors is made up of series or parallel connected resistors in such a way that the resulting resistances can be computed as Ser(x1,x2) = x1 + x2 (type S) or Par(x1,x2) = 1/(1/x1+1/x2) (type P). The parameters are either 1 Ohm or themselves of type S or P. A048211 counts the different resistances which can be produced as S or P type from n unit resistors. With 5 resistors x1 .. x5 there is the bridge configuration (type B),
%C A337516         A         which cannot be computed by functions Ser() and Par().

%e A337516 a(1) through a(6) are identical with A174283 since a fork needs at least 7 resistors. a(7) is also equal to A174283(7) because the fork with 7 unit resistors has resistance 8/7, but this is already an element of SetA174283(7).
%e A337516 a(8) = 421 has six extra resistances {16/17, 40/29, 35/34, 37/29, 35/31, 37/32} which are the result of resistance 2 or 1/2 as any of the resistances x1 .. x7 except for x6.
