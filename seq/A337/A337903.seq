%N A337903 a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1; for n>1, if a(n-1) is composite then a(n) = a(n-1)/A107286(n-1), where A107286(n) = the smallest prime factor of n, otherwise a(n) = a(n-1) + n.
%C A337903 The sequence can only increase for two consecutive terms at most as if a(n) is even then a(n+1) will be a(n)/2, while if a(n) is odd and a(n+1) is prime then a(n+2) will be even and thus a(n+3) = a(n+2)/2.
%C A337903 For the first 100 million terms the lowest number not to have appeared is 888. It is likely all numbers eventually appear although this is unknown.

%e A337903 a(3) = 6 as a(2) = 3 which is prime thus a(3) = 3 + 3 = 6.
%e A337903 a(4) = 3 as a(3) = 6 which has the smallest divisor 2 thus a(4) = 6/2 = 3.
%e A337903 a(11) = 5 as a(10) = 15 which has the smallest divisor 3 thus a(11) = 15/3 = 5.
