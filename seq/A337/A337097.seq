%N A337097 Infinite sum of the odd numbers, compacted (see the Comments line for an explanation).
%C A337097 When the successive terms of the present sequence are expressed as the sum of k>1 consecutive odd numbers and added, the end result will be 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17...... (conjectured to extend ad infinitum).
%C A337097 This is the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms with this property.
%C A337097 The equivalent sequence with sums of consecutive even numbers is simply A336897 where every term is doubled.
%e A337097 The 1st term is 4 and 4 = 1+3.
%e A337097 The 2nd term is 12 and 12 = 5+7.
%e A337097 The 3rd term is 20 and 20 = 9+11.
%e A337097 The 4th term is 28 and 28 = 13+15.
%e A337097 The 5th term is 57 and 57 = 17+19+21; etc.
%e A337097 (The 5th term is NOT 36 as 36 can be expressed as the sum of k>1 consecutive odd numbers in more than one way: 36 = 17+19 and 36 = 1+3+5+7+9+11).
