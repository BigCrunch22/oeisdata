%N A337640 a(n) = one-half of the number of cells in the central rectangle of the graph described in row 2n+1 of A333288.
%C A337640 This is based on _Lars Blomberg_'s data in A333288.
%C A337640 A333288 is a triangular array read by rows. a(n) is the central term in row 2n+1 of that triangle, divided by 2.
%C A337640 See A331452 for further illustrations.
%C A337640 It would be nice to have a formula for this sequence. It is possible that focusing on the points (n, a(n)) where 2n+1 is a prime might lead to a simpler formula.
%H A337640 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A331452/a331452_6.png">Colored illustration for a(0)</a>: there are 4 regions, so a(0) = 2.
%H A337640 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A331452/a331452_8.png">Colored illustration for a(1)</a>: the central square has 22 regions, so a(1) = 11.
%H A337640 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A331452/a331452_10.png">Colored illustration for a(2)</a>: the central square has 70 regions, so a(2) = 35.
%H A337640 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A331452/a331452_32.png">Colored illustration for a(3)</a>: the central square has 160 regions, so a(3) = 80.
%H A337640 Scott R. Shannon, <a href="/A331452/a331452_34.png">Colored illustration for a(4)</a>: the central square has 310 regions, so a(4) = 155.
