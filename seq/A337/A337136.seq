%C A337136 Conjecture: This is a permutation of the natural numbers. Up to 1 million terms the only fixed points are 1,2,3,6,9,10, and it is likely that there are no others.

%e A337136 a(5) = 4 as a(3) + a(4) = 3 + 5 = 8, and 4 is the smallest number that shares a common factor with 8 that has not yet appeared.
%e A337136 a(11) = 19 as a(9) + a(10) = 9 + 10 = 19, and as 19 is prime, a(11) must be the smallest multiple of 19 that has not yet appeared, being 19 in this case.
