%N A337136 a(0) = 0, a(1) = 1; for n > 1, a(n) = smallest positive number which has not appeared which has a common factor with a(n-2)+a(n-1).
%C A337136 This is a permutation of the natural numbers. Up to 1 million terms the fixed points are 0,1,2,3,6,9,10, and it is likely these are the only terms.

%e A337136 a(5) = 4 as a(3)+a(4) = 3+5 = 8, and 4 is the smallest number that shares a common factor with 8 that has not yet appeared.
%e A337136 a(11) = 19 as a(9)+a(10) = 9+10 = 19, and as 19 is prime, a(11) must be the smallest multiple of 19 that has not yet appeared, being 19 in this case.
