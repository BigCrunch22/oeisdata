%N A337163 Numbers divisible by their individual digits, but not by the product of their digits.
%C A337163 The sequence is infinite. For example, all numbers of the form ((10^n-1)/9)*(10^2)+24 are terms for n > 0. The numbers of this form will never be divisible by 8 but they will always be divisible by 1, 2 and 4. Also there are infinitely many terms any three of whose consecutive digits are distinct, for example, concatenations of 124. Are there infinitely many terms which don't consist of periodically repeating substrings?  - _Metin Sariyar_, Jan 28 2021
%C A337163 Every repdigit non-repunit with at least 2 digits is a term. - _Bernard Schott_, Jan 28 2021

%e A337163 48 is divisible by 4 and 8, but 48 is not divisible by 4*8 = 32, so 48 is a term.
%e A337163 128 is divisible by 1, 2 and 8, and 128 is divisible by 1*2*8 = 16 with 128 = 16*8, so 128 is not a term.
