%S A337924 1,3,5,59,151
%N A337924 Odd numbers, x, such that for all primes (p,q) such that x = p + 2q, x + 2p and x + 2q are composite.
%C A337924 The sequence is conjectured to be finite and full in A046927.  The conjecture holds through 10^9.
%e A337924 For 59, (p,q) can be (13,23), (37,11), and (53,3).  59 + 2 * 13, 59 + 2 * 23, ... 59 + 2 * 3 are all composite, so 59 is in the sequence.
%Y A337924 Cf. A046927.
