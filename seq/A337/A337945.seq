%N A337945 Numbers m with a solution (s,t,k) such that s^2 + t^2 = k*m, s + t = m, 1 <= s <= t and 1 <= k <= m - 1.
%e A337945 8 is in the sequence since it has the solutions (s,t,k) = (4,4,4) and (2,6,5) such that s^2 + t^2 = k*m, s + t = m, 1 <= s <= t and 1 <= k <= m - 1.
%e A337945 9 is in the sequence since it has the solution (s,t,k) = (3,6,5) such that s^2 + t^2 = k*m, s + t = m, 1 <= s <= t and 1 <= k <= m - 1.
