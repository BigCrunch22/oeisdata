%N A337933 Numbers that are the sum of two abundant numbers in exactly one way.
%C A337933 An easy to calculate upper bound for terms is 12*(A047802(2)+1) = 64696932312. This and all larger numbers can be expressed as the sum of an abundant multiple of 6 and a multiple of A047802(2) in at least two ways. - _Peter Munn_, Feb 09 2021
%e A337933 24 is in the sequence since it is the sum of two abundant numbers in exactly one way as 24 = 12 + 12.
%e A337933 30 is in the sequence since it is the sum of two abundant numbers in exactly one way as 30 = 12 + 18.
