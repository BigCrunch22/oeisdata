%N A337917 Values of the Ramanujan tau quadruples mod 691 such that four (or more) consecutive Ramanujan tau numbers are congruent mod 691.
%C A337917 Corresponding indices of the Ramanujan tau quadruples mod 691 are listed in A337916.
%C A337917 tau(n) mod 691 appears to be almost evenly distributed between 0 and 690 - 2 through 690 each occur approximately 1/691 of the time; 0 occurs slightly more than that and 1 occurs slightly less.  However, consecutive values that are congruent mod 691 are predominately congruent to 0.
