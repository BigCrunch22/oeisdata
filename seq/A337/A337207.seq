%N A337207 a(n) is the minimal number of legal positions in Go played on connected graphs with n nodes.
%C A337207 Consider a Go game played on general graphs instead of grids. The position that each group has at least one liberty is called a legal position. 2^(n+1)-3 and 3^n-2^n are respectively the trivial lower bound and upper bound of this sequence. The Mathematics of Go interest group computed this sequence up to n=481.
