%N A337063 a(n) = 1 for n < 2; a(n) = freq(a(n-1),n) * freq(a(n-2),n) for n >= 2, where freq(i,j) is the number of times i appears in [a(0),a(1),...,a(j-1)].
%C A337063 Does this sequence contain every number?
%C A337063 Does each number appear only a finite number of times?
%C A337063 Starting with a(0)=0 and a(1)=1 gives the same sequence offset by one place.
