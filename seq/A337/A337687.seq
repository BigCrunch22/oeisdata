%N A337687 a(1) = 2; for n > 1, a(n) = smallest number not occurring earlier which shares a prime factor with a(n-1) and also has a prime factor which is not a factor of a(n-1).
%C A337687 Like A336957 no prime or prime power can be a term as if it shared a prime factor with the previous term it would then not contain a prime factor not in the previous term. It is likely all other composite numbers appear.
