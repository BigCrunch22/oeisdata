%N A337342 Numbers k such that A048673(k) divides 1+A003973(k).
%C A337342 Numbers k such that A048673(k) = A337335(k). Equivalently, numbers k such that (A003961(k)+1)/2 divides 1+A003973(k).
%C A337342 No squares larger than one in this sequence => No quasiperfect numbers. See also A337339. For any x corresponding to a quasiperfect number qp = A003961(x), the quotient (1+A003973(x)) / A048673(x) should be 4. Thus that A003961(x) should also be a member of A325311.
%C A337342 At least for the terms x = a(2) .. a(6) here, the quotient (1+A003973(x)) / A048673(x) = 3. The terms for which the quotient is 3 are precisely those which by prime shifting become the terms of A007593 (that are all odd), thus the terms y = A064989(A007593(n)), for n >= 1, form a subsequence of this sequence.
%C A337342 a(7) > 2^28.
