%N A337534 Nontrivial squares together with nonsquares whose square part's square root is in the sequence.
%C A337534 The appearance of a number is determined by its prime signature.
%C A337534 No terms are squarefree, as the square root of the square part of a squarefree number is 1.
%C A337534 If the square part of k is a 4th power, other than 1, k appears.
%C A337534 Every positive integer k is the product of a unique subset S_k of the terms of A050376, which are arranged in array form in A329050 (primes in column 0, squares of primes in column 1, 4th powers of primes in column 2 and so on). k is in this sequence if and only if there is m >= 1 such that column m of A329050 contains a member of S_k, but column m - 1 does not.

%F A337534 Numbers k such that A209229(A267116(k) + 1) = 0.
%F A337534 A008833(a(n)) > 1.
%e A337534 4 is square and nontrivial (not 1), so 4 is in the sequence.
%e A337534 12 = 3 * 2^2 is nonsquare, but has square part 4, whose square root (2) is not in the sequence. So 12 is not in the sequence.
%e A337534 32 = 2 * 4^2 is nonsquare, and has square part 16, whose square root (4) is in the sequence. So 32 is in the sequence.
