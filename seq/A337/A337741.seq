%N A337741 Numbers all of whose divisors are Niven numbers (A005349).
%C A337741 Since the only prime Niven numbers are the single-digit primes 2, 3, 5 and 7, all the terms are 7-smooth numbers (A002473).
%C A337741 If k is a term, all the divisors of k are also terms. Since all the terms are 7-smooth, every term is of the form p * k, where p is in {2, 3, 5, 7} and k is a smaller term. Thus it is easy to verify that there are only 31 terms in this sequence, and 1944 being the last term.
%e A337741 6 is a term since all the divisors of 6, i.e., 1, 2, 3 and 6, are Niven numbers.
