%N A337980 When terms first appear in the sequence they are "untouched". Start with a(1)=1. Thereafter, to find a(n), let k = a(n-1). If there is an earlier occurrence a(n-m) = k which is untouched, then a(n) = m and a(n-m) is now "touched". Otherwise, a(n) = 0.
%C A337980 Similar to the Van Eck sequence A181391, except (1) A181391 starts with a 0 instead of a 1, and (2) in A181391 each nonzero term a(n) = m-1 instead of m as in the definition above.

%F A337980 b(n)=0 => a(n+1)=0; b(n)>0 => a(n+1)=b(n)+1; where b=A181391. - _Jan Ritsema van Eck_, Jan 09 2021
%e A337980 a(1) = 1. There is no untouched 1 before a(1), so a(2) = 0. There is no untouched 0 before a(2), so a(3) = 0. a(2) = 0, so a(4) = 2 and a(2) is marked "touched" (we can't use it again, but it is still in the sequence). No untouched 2 yet, so a(5) = 0. a(2) = 0, but it has been touched, while a(3) = 0, so a(6) = 2.
