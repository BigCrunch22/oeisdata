%N A337596 Largest m such that k^n (mod m) is always either 0, +1, or -1.
%C A337596 For a given n, for all k, k^n mod a(n) will always be either 0, 1 or a(n)-1. This will not be true for numbers larger than a(n).
%C A337596 It appears that a(m) = 4 for m in A045979. - _Michel Marcus_, Sep 04 2020
%e A337596 For n = 5 all fifth powers of natural numbers: 1,32,243,1024, etc. are either a multiple of 11, or 1 greater or 1 less than a multiple of 11. There is no greater number than 11 for which all fifth powers are at most 1 different from a multiple. So a(5) = 11.
