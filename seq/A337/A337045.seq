%N A337045 Indecomposable sigma-powerful numbers: powerful numbers k such that sigma(k) is also powerful, but restricted to terms that are not the product of 2 terms > 1 of A337044.
%C A337045 This is an implementation of the suggestion that Walter A. Kehowski made on his website (see link) with regard to so-called indecomposable sigma-powerful numbers. However, the results deviate from the table linked there. The table is considered to be deficient.

%e A337045 From _David A. Corneth_, Aug 29 2020: (Start)
%e A337045 No two proper divisors of 400 are sigma-powerful and have the product of those divisors 400 so 400 is in the sequence.
%e A337045 27783 = 81 * 343 is sigma-powerful but 81 and 343 are sigma-powerful as well so 27783 can be decomposed into two sigma-powerful factors. So 27783 is not in the sequence. (End)
