%N A337103 Numbers k with a divisor pair (d,k/d) whose harmonic mean is an integer.
%C A337103 All positive squares are in the sequence since they have a divisor pair such that (d,k/d) = (d,d). The harmonic mean is then an integer since we have 2*d*d/(d+d) = 2*d*d/(2*d) = d.
%e A337103 18 is in the sequence since it has the divisor pair (3,6) with harmonic mean 2*3*6/(3+6) = 36/9 = 4 (an integer).
%e A337103 25 is in the sequence since it has the divisor pair (5,5) with harmonic mean 2*5*5/(5+5) = 50/10 = 5 (an integer).
