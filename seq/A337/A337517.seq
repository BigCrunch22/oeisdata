%N A337517 a(n) is the number of distinct resistances that can be produced from a circuit with exactly n unit resistors.
%C A337517 One can view a circuit with n unit resistors as a multigraph G with n edges and a pair P of distinguished nodes. Every edge of the graph must be contained in a path connecting the two distinguished nodes.
%C A337517 In case n > 0, a(n) counts all resistances R(G, P), which are rational numbers by Kirchhoff's laws. In case n = 0, the graph G consists of only two pair P nodes, and there is only one resistance: oo = infinity; so a(0) = 1. In the OEIS, there are already sequences that count the possible resistances of circuits of certain types (for the definitions see A337516).

%C A337517 The table shows the number of different resistances, which grows with the complexity of the circuits. Values in square brackets mark the beginning of the newly explored range. Values a(n) up to n = 7 are fully classified, and have one of the given types, i.e., they can be computed by the functions Ser(), Par(), Bri(), and Frk() defined in A337516. For a(n), n >= 8, the theory in A180414 has to be applied.
%C A337517 Note: The 'set counted by A180414(n)' is the union of all 'sets counted by A337517(k) for k = 0 .. n'.
%C A337517 Admissible networks (G, P) are those defined in the Karnofsky paper (A180414).
