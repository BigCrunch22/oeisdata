%N A337238 Number k such that k and k+1 are both digitally balanced numbers in base 2 (A031443).
%C A337238 All the terms are of the form 4*k + 1, where k is a digitally balanced number in base 2. Therefore, there are no 3 consecutive numbers that are digitally balanced in base 2.
%C A337238 The number of terms below 2^k is A079309(floor(k/2)-1) for k > 3.
