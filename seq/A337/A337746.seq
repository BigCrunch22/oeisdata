%N A337746 Maximum number of bishops within an n X n chessboard, where each bishop has a path to an edge.
%C A337746 Given an n X n chessboard, this sequence is the maximum number of bishops that can be placed on the board, such that each bishop has a free path to the edge of the board without another bishop moving.
%C A337746 Bishops on even and odd squares don't interfere and can be maximized separately. When n is even, the two types are equal via symmetry and thus the maximum number of bishops will be 2 * (maximum number of one type of bishop).
