%N A337648 Odd primes p such that the first term in A336957 that is divisible by p is 2*p.
%C A337648 Conjecture 1: this sequence contains all primes > 367.
%C A337648 Conjecture 2: The set of odd primes is partitioned into A337648, A337649, and {7}.
%C A337648 (These conjectures have been checked for the first 161734 terms of A336957.)
%C A337648 When an odd prime p first divides a term of A336957 that term is equal to q*p where q < p is also a prime. It appears q is almost always 2 (the corresponding values of p form the present sequence), that there are 34 instances when q = 3 (see A337649), and q>3 happens just once, at A336957(5) = 35 when q=5 and p=7.
