%N A337938 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n, k) gives the primitive period of the sequence {k (Modd n)}_{k >= 0}, for n >= 1.
%C A337938 The length of row n is 1 for n = 1, 2 for n = 2, and 2*n for n >= 3.
%C A337938 The modified modular equivalence relation Modd n is defined, for integer k and positive integer n, by  k (Modd n) = k (mod n) if floor(k/n) is even, and -k (mod n) if floor(k/n) is odd. The smallest nonnegative complete residue system modulo n, namely RS(n) = {0, 1, ..., n-1}, is used. See the W. Lang link, Definition 4, eq. (69), p. 25 - 26.
%C A337938 In order to have row length 2*n for all n >= 1 one could use for n = 1 and 2 the imprimitive periods 0, 0 and 0, 1, 0, 1, respectively.
%C A337938 The name Modd n derives from the fact that the multiplicative (but not additive ) group Modd n has the smallest positive reduced residue system with only odd numbers, named RRSodd(n), as elements (for n = 0 RRS(n) = {0}, but here it is taken as {1}). This group is isomorphic to the Galois group G(rho(n)) = Gal(Q(rho(n))/Q), with rho(n) = 2*cos(pi/n). See the W. Lang link.

%F A337938 T(n,k) = k (Modd n), for n >= 1, and k = 0 for n = 1, k = 0, 1 for n = 2, and k = 0, 1, ..., 2*n - 1, for n >= 3. For k (Modd n) see the comment above.

%e A337938 T(1, 0) = 0 because {k (Modd 1)}_{k >= 0} is the 0 sequence A000007:  0 (Modd 1) =  0 (mod 1) = 0, 1 (Modd 1) = -1 (mod 1) = 0,  2 (Modd 1) = 2 (mod 1) = 0, ... .
%e A337938 T(7, 6) = 6 because floor(6/7) = 0, which is even, hence 6 (Modd 7) = 6 (mod 7) = 6.
%e A337938 T(7, 8) = 6 because  floor(8/7) = 1, which is odd, hence  8 (Modd 7) = -8 (mod 7) = 6.
