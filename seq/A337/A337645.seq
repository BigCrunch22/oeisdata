%N A337645 a(1)=2; thereafter, a(n) = smallest number with at least two different prime factors that is missing from A336957 after A336957(n) has been found.
%C A337645 The initial 2 is an exception. For n>2, A336957(n) is required to have at least two different prime factors.
%C A337645 It is conjectured that every number with at least two different prime factors will eventually appear in A336957.

%e A337645 A336957 begins 1, 2, 6, 15, 35, 14, with A336957(6)=14. At that point 10 is the smallest legal candidate that has not yet appeared, so a(6) = 10.
