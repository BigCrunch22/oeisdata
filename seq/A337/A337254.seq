%N A337254 Squares visited by a rook moving on a spirally numbered board always to the lowest available unvisited square with a move length of the current square (in decimal) + 1.
%C A337254 The rook may move over squares it has already visited, only the final square after a full move must not have been visited before.
%C A337254 As for A316667, the rook gets trapped as well. This happens after step 185 on square 118.
%C A337254 Rook movement on the square spiral is also considered in A336447 and A336413.
%C A337254 This is a variation of generalized knights, as in A323749, where here each move is a (x,0)-leaper but as opposed to A323749 the x changes depending on the current square rather than having a fixed size for each move.

%e A337254 The rook starts on square a(1) = 1. Thus its available moves are of length len(1) + 1 = 2, possibly reaching squares 11, 15, 19 and 23. Since 11 is the smallest value, a(2) = 11. From there on, the next move must have length len(11) + 1 = 3, etc.
