%N A337090 Number of rooted trees of n vertices in which all leaves are at odd depths (distances down from the root).
%C A337090 For n=0, there are no rooted trees at all, per A000081.
%C A337090 For n>=1, by omitting the root vertex, a(n) is the number of nonempty rooted forests of n-1 vertices with all leaves at even depths down from the forest roots.
%C A337090 A337089 counts trees with all leaves at even depths.  The forests interpretation here is those even trees assembled to make even forests so that this sequence is shift-up of the Euler transform of A337089.  But the usual Euler transform includes an empty forest which is not wanted here, and so -1 in the generating function forms.  The sum formula is the usual Euler transform, except its cross-products re-using term a(1) expect the empty forest there, so +1 because it's not.  A337089 is, in its turn, shift-up of the Euler transform of the present sequence so that it's convenient to calculate them together term by term.
