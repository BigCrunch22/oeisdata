%N A337271 Irregular triangle read by rows: T(n,k) = number of tournaments on n elements with k primary ascents.
%C A337271 More precisely, a tournament on {1,...,n} is a digraph with arcs between i and j for each i<j; either i->j or i<-j. The arc is an "ascent" if i->j.
%C A337271 It is a "primary ascent" if it's an ascent for which i and j belong to the same "initially connected component".
%C A337271 The initially connected components of a tournament on {1,...,n} are defined as follows: One component consists of everything reachable from 1. Remove that component; the next component, if any vertices remain, consists of everything reachable from the smallest remaining vertex. And so on.
%C A337271 For example, suppose n=4 and 1<-2, 1->3, 1<-4, 2->3, 2->4, 3<-4.
%C A337271 There are two initially connected components: {1,3} and {2,4}.
%C A337271 There are three ascents: 1->3, 2->3, 2->4. But only 1->3 and 2->4 are primary; 2->3 doesn't count, because 2 and 3 are in different components.
%C A337271 Hence this example is one of the 18 tournaments on 4 elements with 2 primary ascents.
