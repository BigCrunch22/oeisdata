%N A337802 Minimum value of the cyclic self-convolution of the first n terms of the characteristic function of primes.
%C A337802 In the first 1000 terms, a(n) = 1 only for n = 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 31, 43, 47, 61, 73, 107, 109, 113, 181, 199, and 467.
%C A337802 Is there an index k such that a(n) = 0 for n > k ?
%e A337802 The primes among the first 5 positive integers (1,2,3,4,5) are 2, 3, and 5, then the corresponding characteristic function of primes is (0,1,1,0,1) (see A010051) and the corresponding five possible cyclic self-convolutions are the dot products between (0,1,1,0,1) and the rotations of its mirrored version as shown below:
%e A337802   (0,1,1,0,1).(1,0,1,1,0) = 0*1 + 1*0 + 1*1 + 0*1 + 1*0 = 1,
%e A337802   (0,1,1,0,1).(0,1,0,1,1) = 0*0 + 1*1 + 1*0 + 0*1 + 1*1 = 2,
%e A337802   (0,1,1,0,1).(1,0,1,0,1) = 0*1 + 1*0 + 1*1 + 0*0 + 1*1 = 2,
%e A337802   (0,1,1,0,1).(1,1,0,1,0) = 0*1 + 1*1 + 1*0 + 0*1 + 1*0 = 1,
%e A337802   (0,1,1,0,1).(0,1,1,0,1) = 0*0 + 1*1 + 1*1 + 0*0 + 1*1 = 3.
%e A337802 Then a(5)=1 because 1 is the minimum among the five values.
