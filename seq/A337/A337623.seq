%N A337623 a(n) is the least positive multiple of 2*n-1 containing only the digits 0 and 1 in base n.
%C A337623 Based on test for divisibility, where in base n the number n*a + b is divisible by x if and only if a + b*m is also divisible by x, and a multiple of x is one less than m*n.
%C A337623 Example:
%C A337623 10a + b |13
%C A337623 10a + b + 13*b*t |13 (Add multiple of 13)
%C A337623 10a + b(1 + 13t) |13 (Rearrange)
%C A337623 10a + b(1 + 13*3) |13 (Let t be 3)
%C A337623 a + b*4 | 13 (Divide by base (10). 13 is coprime to 10, so divisibility to 13 is contained) |13
%C A337623 Specifically (in base n): a*n + b is divisible by 2n-1 if and only if a + b*2 is also divisible by 2n - 1.
%C A337623 By doing the "10a + b => a + 2b" process (that preserves divisibility by 2n-1) iteratively, you get reversed binary representation.
%C A337623 It's still the lowest case even after reversing digits, since any higher multiple in base 2 will always add digits.
%F A337623 1. Write 2n-1 in binary.
%F A337623 2. Reverse order of digits.
%F A337623 3. Read as number in base n.
%F A337623 Pseudo code: read_base_n(reverse(write_base_2(2n-1))).
%F A337623 a(n) = (2*n-1)*A337624(n).
%e A337623 Base 10:
%e A337623 2n - 1 = 19.
%e A337623 19 in binary: 10011
%e A337623 Reversed: 11001
%e A337623 11001 is thus the lowest number in base 10 divisible by 19 that contains only the digits 0 and 1.
