%N A337585 a(n) is the number of integer multisets (partitions) for which the number of partitions of n with matching multiplicity multiset is odd.
%C A337585 The number of multiplicity multisets met by a positive even number of partitions of n is A088887(n) - a(n).
%C A337585 The parity of a(n) is A040051(n).
%F A337585 a(n) = Sum_{k odd} A337583(n, k).
%e A337585 The partitions of 7 exhibit 10 = A088887(7) different multisets of multiplicities. Except for (3, 1) (met by partitions (4, 1, 1, 1) and (2, 2, 2, 1)), an odd number of partitions of 7 lead to each of them, so a(7) = 9.
