%N A337305 a(n) is the greatest number m not yet in the sequence such that the ternary expansions of n and of m have the same runs of consecutive equal digits (up to order but with multiplicity).
%C A337305 This sequence is the base 3 analog of A337304.
%C A337305 This sequence is a self-inverse permutation of the nonnegative integers.

%e A337305 For n = 144:
%e A337305 - the ternary representation of 144 is "12100",
%e A337305 - the corresponding runs of consecutive equal digits are: "1", "2", "1", "00",
%e A337305 - there are five numbers k with the same multiset of runs:
%e A337305     k    ter(k)
%e A337305     ---  -------
%e A337305      86  "10012"
%e A337305      88  "10021"
%e A337305     136  "12001"
%e A337305     144  "12100"
%e A337305     190  "21001"
%e A337305 - so a(86) = 190,
