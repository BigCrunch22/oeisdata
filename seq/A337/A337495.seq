%N A337495 Maximum number of preimages that a permutation of length n can have under the consecutive-123-avoiding stack-sorting map.
%H A337495 Colin Defant and Kai Zheng, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12297">Stack-sorting with consecutive-pattern-avoiding stacks</a>, arXiv:2008.12297 [math.CO], 2020.
%e A337495 The consecutive-123-avoiding stack-sorting map acts on permutations of length 3 by reversing every permutation except 321, which gets sent to 213. The permutation 213 has 2 preimages under this map (namely, 312 and 321), and every other permutation of length 3 has at most one preimage. Hence, a(3)=2.
