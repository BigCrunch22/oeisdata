%N A337123 a(n) is the number of primes p in the n-digit "signed nonadjacent form" such that p has 3 or fewer nonzero digits.
%C A337123 Sign nonadjacent form notation is defined by the publications listed in the reference.
%C A337123 We use abbreviation SNF for "signed nonadjacent form" notation.
%C A337123 This is an expansion of A337124 to include 2 and primes in the form of 2^k+1 and 2^k-1.

%e A337123 There is only one number in single-digit SNF notation, which is 1 and 1 is not a prime.  So a(1)=0;
%e A337123 There is only one number in the two-digit SNF notation, which is 10 = 2 base 10 and it is a prime with one nonzero digit.  So a(2)=1;
%e A337123 There are three numbers in three digits SNF notation: 10T = 3 base 10, 100 = 4 base 10, and 101 = 5 base 10.  There are two prime numbers among 3, 4, and 5 and both of them have two nonzero digits. So a(3)=2;
%e A337123 ...
%e A337123 For seven-digit SNF numbers, 10T0T0T = 43 base 10 has 4 nonzero digits (excluded); 10T000T = 47 base 10 has 3 nonzero digits (included). Thereafter 10T0101 = 53: 4 digits, excluded; 1000T0T = 59: 3 digits, included; 1000T01 = 61: 3 digits, included; 100010T = 67: 3 digits, included; 100100T = 71: 3 digits, included; 1001001 = 73, 3 digits, included; 101000T = 79: 3 digits, included; 101010T = 83, 4 digits, excluded.  In total, 7 numbers fit the definition.  So a(7)=7.
