%N A230260 Number of decompositions of 2n into unordered sums of two primes with an even sum of Hamming weights.
%C A230260 Number of ways to write 2*n = p + q with A000120(p) + A000120(q) = 2*k for p, q primes and some k.
%C A230260 A045917(n) = a(n) + (number of decompositions of 2n into unordered sums of two primes where Hamming weight of concatenation of this primes is equal to 2*m+1).
%C A230260 A045917(n) - a(n) = b(n): 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, ... .
%C A230260 b(n) = 0 for n: 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 13, 16, 19, 34, 43, 46, 49, 64, 82, 94.
%C A230260 Strengthening of Goldbach's conjecture: b(n) > 0 for all n > 94.
%C A230260 If 2*a(n) = A045917(n) then n: 1, 5, 7, 9, 14, 17, 25, 30, 33, 50, 57, 76, 77, 92, ... .
%C A230260 a(n) = 0 for n = 2*4^m, m>0 since 2*2*4^m in binary is 1 followed by an even number of zeros, and so 4^m-x and x (because they are binary complement of each other) together always have 2m+1 one bits, as long as x is odd. - _Ralf Stephan_, Oct 16 2013
