%N A230410 After a(0)=0, a(n) = A230415(A219666(n),A219666(n-1)).
%C A230410 After zero, a(n) = number of positions where digits in the factorial base representations of successive nodes A219666(n-1) and A219666(n) in the infinite trunk of the factorial beanstalk differ from each other.

%F A230410 a(0)=0, and for n>=1, a(n) = A230415(A219666(n),A219666(n-1)).
%F A230410 For all n, a(A226061(n+1)) = A232094(n).
%e A230410 a(8) = 1, because A219666(8)=23, whose factorial base representation (A007623(23)) is '321', and A219666(7)=17, whose factorial base representation (A007623(17)) is '221', and they differ just in one digit position.
%e A230410 a(9) = 3, because A219666(9)=25, '...01001' in factorial base, which differs from '...0321' in three digit positions.
%e A230410 Note that A226061(4)=8 (A226061(n) tells the position of (n!)-1 in A219666), and 1+2+3 = 6 happens to be both a triangular number (A000217) and a factorial number (A000142).
%e A230410 The next time 1 occurs in this sequence because of this coincidence is at x=A226061(16) (whose value is currently not known), as at that point A219666(x) = 16!-1 = 20922789887999, whose factorial base representation is (15,14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1), and A000217(15) = 120 = A000142(5), which means that A219666(x-1) = A219651(20922789887999) = 20922789887879, whose factorial base representation is (15,14,13,12,11,10,9,8,7,6,4,4,3,2,1), which differs only in one position from the previous.
%e A230410 Of course 1's occur in this sequence for other reasons as well.
