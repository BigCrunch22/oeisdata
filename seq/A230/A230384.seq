%N A230384 Table read by rows: Least set of n odious numbers (A000069) such that any two or more add to an evil number (A001969); ordered by total sum of elements, then by largest element(s).
%C A230384 Row sums are given in A230387. See A230385 for a "dual" version.
%C A230384 Is this sequence finite, or is there for any n at least one admissible set of n odious numbers, i.e., such that any sum of two or more elements add up to an evil number?

%e A230384 For n=1 to 4, we have the sets
%e A230384 n=1: {1} with sum = 1,
%e A230384 n=2: {1, 2} with sum = 3
%e A230384 n=3: {2, 7, 8} with sum = 17,
%e A230384 n=4: {4, 19, 49, 67} with sum = 139.
%e A230384 E.g., for n=3, the numbers 2, 7 and 8 have an odd bit sum, but 2+7, 2+8, 7+8 and 2+7+8 all have an odd bit sum.
%e A230384 For n=4, we also have the admissible set {14, 31, 44, 61} which has a smaller maximal element, but a larger total sum.
%e A230384 n=5: {42, 84, 138, 174, 357} with sum = 795.
%e A230384 n=6: {168, 348, 372, 702, 906, 1407} with sum = 3903.
