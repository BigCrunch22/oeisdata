%N A230812 Smallest squarefree side lengths of primitive integer Soddyian triangles.
%C A230812 A Soddyian triangle is a triangle whose outer Soddy circle has degenerated into a straight line. Its side lengths are related by the equation 1/sqrt(s-c) = 1/sqrt(s-b)+1/sqrt(s-a) where the sides a <= b <= c and s is the semiperimeter. It is Heronian. The smallest side length of a primitive Soddyian triangle is given as a = n^2((m+n)^2+m^2) for integers m >= n > 0 with GCD(m, n) = 1. If this side length is squarefree, then n = 1 and (m+1)^2+m^2 has to be squarefree. a(n) is the ordered sequence of squarefree integers t of the form t = (m+1)^2+m^2. Note that t uniquely determines the primitive Soddyian triple whenever the smallest side length is squarefree.

%F A230812 Squarefree integers of the form (m+1)^2+m^2 for any integer m > 0.
%e A230812 a(3)=41 because the triangle with sides (41, 416, 425) is a primitive Soddyian triangles, 41 is squarefree and is the 3rd occurrence of such a squarefree integer.
