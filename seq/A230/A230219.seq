%N A230219 Number of ways to write 2*n + 1 = p + q + r with p <= q such that p, q, r are primes in A230217 and p + q + 9 is also prime.
%C A230219 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 6.
%C A230219 This implies Goldbach's weak conjecture for odd numbers and also Goldbach's conjecture for even numbers.
%C A230219 The conjecture also implies that there are infinitely many primes in A230217.

%e A230219 a(18) = 1 since 2*18 + 1 = 7 + 13 + 17, and 7, 13, 17 are terms of A230217, and 7 + 13 + 9 = 29 is a prime.
