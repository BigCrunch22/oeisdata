%N A230587 Number n such that the sum of its proper evil divisors (A001969) equals n.
%C A230587 Sequence could be called the "evil-perfect numbers".
%C A230587 By the Euclid-Euler theorem, an even number n is perfect (A000396) if and only if n=2^(k-1)*(2^k-1), where 2^k-1 is prime. From this it follows that all even perfect numbers more than 6 have only odious divisors (A000069). In contrast to them, this sequence lists those abundant numbers n (A005101), all proper evil divisors of which sum to n.
%C A230587 It is asked, are there non-perfect numbers n, all proper odious divisors of which sum to n? The first two such numbers were found by Giovanni Resta, see A212302.

%e A230587 18 is in the sequence since its proper divisors are {1, 2, 3, 6, 9}, and their subset that is in A001969 is {3, 6, 9} whose sum is 18.
