%N A230718 Smallest n-th power equal to a sum of some consecutive, immediately preceding, positive n-th powers, or 0 if none.
%C A230718 a(n) is the smallest solution to k^n + (k+1)^n + ... + (k+m)^n = (k+m+1)^n with k > 0 and m > 0, or 0 if none.
%C A230718 Dickson says Escott proved that for 2 <= n <= 5, the only solutions are 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2 and 3^3 + 4^3 + 5^3 = 6^3. Thus a(4) = a(5) = 0.
%C A230718 Is a(n) != 0 for any n > 3?
%C A230718 The Erdos-Moser equation is the case k = 1. They conjecture that the only solution is m = n = 1. Any counterexample would be a case of a(n) > 0 with n > 3. And such a case with k = 1 would be a counterexample to the Erdos-Moser conjecture.
