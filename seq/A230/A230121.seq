%N A230121 Number of ways to write n = x + y + z (0 < x <= y <= z) such that x*(x+1)/2 + y*(y+1)/2 + z*(z+1)/2 is a triangular number.
%C A230121 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 except for n = 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 12. Moreover, for each n = 20, 21, ... there are three distinct positive integers x, y and z with x + y + z = n such that x*(x+1)/2 + y*(y+1)/2 + z*(z+1)/2 is a triangular number.
%C A230121 (ii) A positive integer n cannot be written as x + y + z (x, y, z > 0) with x^2 + y^2 + z^2 a square if and only if n has the form 2^r*3^s or the form 2^r*7, where r and s are nonnegative integers.
%C A230121 (iii) Any integer n > 14 can be written as a + b + c + d, where a, b, c, d are positive integers with a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 a square. If n > 20 is not among 22, 28, 30, 38, 44, 60, then we may require additionally that a, b, c, d are pairwise distinct.
%C A230121 (iv) For each integer n > 50 not equal to 71, there are positive integers a, b, c, d with a + b + c + d = n such that both a^2 + b^2 and c^2 + d^2 are squares.
%C A230121 Part (ii) and the first assertion in part (iii) were confirmed by Chao Huang and Zhi-Wei Sun in 2021. - _Zhi-Wei Sun_, May 09 2021
