%N A230596 Number of ways to write n = x + y + z with 0 < x <= y <= z such that x*y*z is a triangular number, and that x is a triangular number of the form (p^2 - 1)/8 with p an odd prime.
%C A230596 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 except for n = 1, 2, 4, 7.
%C A230596 (ii) For any integer n > 7, there are positive integers x, y, z with x + y + z = n such that x*y*z is a triangular number and x is among 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
%C A230596 Note that a(3k) and a(3k+2) are positive for every k = 1, 2, 3, .... In fact, 3k = 1 + k + (2k-1) with 1*k*(2k-1) = 2k*(2k-1)/2 a triangular number, and  3k+2 = 1 + k + (2k+1) with 1*k*(2k+1) = 2k(2k+1)/2 a triangular number.

%e A230596 a(10) = 1 since 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, and 3 = (5^2-1)/8 with 5 an odd prime, and 3*3*4 = 8*9/2 is a triangular number.
%e A230596 a(31) = 1 since 31 = 3 + 11 + 17, and 3 = (5^2-1)/8 with 5 an odd prime, and 3*11*17 = 33*34/2 is a triangular number.
