%N A230561 Smallest number that is the sum of two positive n-th powers in >= n ways.
%C A230561 Guy, 2004: "Euler knew that 635318657 = 133^4 + 134^4 = 59^4 + 158^4, and Leech showed this to be the smallest example. No one knows of three such equal sums." Thus no one knows whether a(4) exists, which requires four such equal sums.
%C A230561 a(4) > 10^21 (if it exists). There is no number <= 10^21 that is the sum of two positive 4th powers in >= three ways. - _Donovan Johnson_, Jan 07 2014
