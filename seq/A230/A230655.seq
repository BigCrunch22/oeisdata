%N A230655 Squared radii of circles around a point of the hexagonal lattice that contain a record number of lattice points.
%C A230655 It appears that this is also the sequence of numbers with a record number of divisors all of whose prime factors are of the form 3k + 1. - _Amiram Eldar_, Sep 12 2019 [This is correct, see A343771. - _Jianing Song_, May 19 2021]
%C A230655 Indices of records of A004016. Apart from the first term, also indices of records of A002324. - _Jianing Song_, May 20 2021

%e A230655 a(2)=7 because a circle with radius sqrt(7) around the lattice point at (0,0) is the first circle that passes through more lattice points than a circle with radius 1, which passes through 6 points. The 12 hit points are (+-1/2,+-3*sqrt(3)/2), (+-2,+-sqrt(3)), (+-5/2, +-sqrt(3)/2).
