%N A230044 Nonnegative numbers k such that k plus a perfect square is a triangular number.
%C A230044 Negative k are in A175035.
%C A230044 Numbers such that the Diophantine equation y^2 + y - 2x^2 = 2n, y > 0 has a solution. Empirically, solutions (x,y) don't exceed (5n,5n) for n < 10^5. Record quotients y/n are at n = 2, 3, 12, 45, 1225, 6806, ...
%C A230044 Conjecture: these are the sorted distinct terms of A064784.
%C A230044 n is in this sequence iff 8n+1 is in A035251, that is, every prime p == 3 or 5 (mod 8) dividing 8n+1 appears to an even power. - _Max Alekseyev_, Oct 14 2013
