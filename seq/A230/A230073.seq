%N A230073 Coefficients of the minimal polynomials of the algebraic numbers sqLhat(2*l) from A230072, l >= 1, related to the square of all length in a regular (2*l)-gon inscribed in a circle of radius 1 length unit.
%C A230073 The length of row No. l of this table is delta(2*l) + 1 = A055034(2*l) + 1.
%C A230073 sqLhat(2*l), l >= 1, from A230072, an algebraic number (in fact integer) of degree delta(2*l) over the rationals, gives the square of the sum of the lengths ratios of all lines/R (also called chords/R) divided by (2*l)^2 in a regular (2*l)-gon inscribed in a circle of radius R. This number lives in the algebraic number field Q(rho(2*l)), with rho(2*l) = 2*cos(Pi/(2*l)) (see A187360 and the W. Lang link below for this number field).
%C A230073 The minimal polynomial for sqLhat(2*l) = sum(A230072(l,m)* rho(2*l)^m, m=0..delta(2*l)), called here psqLhat(l, x), is computed from the conjugates rho(2*l)^{(j)}, j=0 ,..., delta(2*l)-1, with rho(2*l)^{(0)} = rho(2*l), by calculating the conjugates sqLhat(2*l)^{(j)}, j = 0, ..., delta(2*l)-1, which are polynomials in rho(2*l) =: z, with the usual rules for conjugation. All results have to be taken modulo the minimal polynomial C(2*l, z) of rho(2*l) (see A187360 table 2 and section 3 for C(n,x)), in order to obtain finally elements written in the power basis of the field Q(rho(2*l)). The conjugates rho(2*l)^{(j)} are just the delta(2*l) roots of C(2*l, z). Therefore, psqLhat(l, x) = product(x - substitute(rho(2*l) = z, sqLhat(2*l)^{(j)}), j = 0.. delta(2*l)-1) (mod C(2*l, z)).
%C A230073 Thanks go to Seppo Mustonen who asked me to look into this matter. I thank him for sending the below given link to his work about the square of the sum of all lengths in an n-gon, called there L(n)^2. Here n is even (n=2*l) and sqLhat(2*l) =(L(n)^2)/n^2. The odd n case is obtained from A228780 as L(2*l+1)^2 = (2*l+1)^2*S2(2*l+1) (observing that all distinct line length come precisely n times in the regular n-gon if n is odd). His polynomials given in his eq. (6) (here for the n even case) are in general not monic, and not irreducible. Instead one should consider the minimal (monic, irreducible and integer) polynomials  PsqL(l, x) := (2*l)^(2*delta(2*l))* psqLhat(l, x/(2*l)^2), l >= 1 (for n = 2*l).
%C A230073 Mustonen's polynomials from his  eq. (6) for the even n case coincide with PsqL(l, x) precisely for l = 2^k, k>=1, and for l = 1 (k=0) one has to take the negative. In all other cases the degrees do not fit (Mustonen's polynomials become reducible over the integers). His conjecture for the coefficients can then be rewritten as a conjecture for the present polynomials  psqLhat(2^k, x),  k >= 0 (see the formula section).
%C A230073 S. Mustonen also conjectured about the other zeros of his polynomials.

%F A230073 Mustonen's conjecture (adapted, see a comment above) is: a(2^k,m) = ((-1)^m)*binomial(2*2^k,2*m), k >= 1, and for k=0 a(1,0) = -1 and  a(1,1) = 1 is trivial.
