%N A230769 Numbers k such that (k+1)*2^k - 1 is prime.
%C A230769 1, 2 and 5 are the only terms of this sequence which are also in A029544. - _Gerasimov Sergey_, Feb 23 2014
%C A230769 The next term with this property is > 10000. - _Michael B. Porter_, Feb 23 2014
%C A230769 The probability of a given number N being a twin prime grows like 1/(log(N))^2, so for a given n, the probability that it has this property is 1/n^2, and the sum converges.  Are there any n for which n*2^n-1 and n*2^n+1 are both prime? - _Michael B. Porter_, Feb 25 2014
%C A230769 We can write (k+1)*2^k - 1 = {(k+1)/2}*4^{(k+1)/2} - 1, and when k is odd, this takes the form of a generalized Woodall prime (base 4). These are listed in A086661. In other words, {2*A086661 - 1} gives all the odd terms of this sequence. - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Oct 16 2019
%C A230769 The largest odd term currently known is 3986381 = 2*A086661(21) - 1. - _Jeppe Stig Nielsen_, Oct 16 2019
