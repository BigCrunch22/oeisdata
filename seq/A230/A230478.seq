%N A230478 Smallest number divisible by all numbers from 1 to 2*n-1, but not divisible by n, or 0 if impossible.
%C A230478 a(n) = 0 if and only if n has more than one distinct prime in its prime factorization (i.e., if and only if n is a member of A024619).
%e A230478 a(4) = 210 because 210 is divisible by 1,2,3,5,6,7 but not 4. a(6) is 0 because there's no number divisible by 1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11 but not 6 (any number divisible by both 2 and 3 is divisible by 6).
