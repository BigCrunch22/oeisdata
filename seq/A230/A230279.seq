%N A230279 Number of nonnegative integer solutions to the equation x^2 - 16*y^2 = n.
%C A230279 For (x, y) to be a solution to the more general equation x^2 - d^2*y^2 = n, it can be shown that n-f^2 must be divisible by 2*f*d, where f is a divisor of n not exceeding sqrt(n). Then y = (n-f^2)/(2*f*d) and x = d*y+f.

%e A230279 a(33)=2 because x^2 - 16*y^2 = 33 has two solutions: (x,y) = (17,4) and (7,1).
