%N A230252 Number of ways to write n = x + y (x, y > 0) with 2*x + 1, x^2 + x + 1 and y^2 + y + 1 all prime.
%C A230252 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 1.
%C A230252 (ii) Any integer n > 3 can be written as p + q with p, 2*p - 3 and q^2 + q + 1 all prime. Also, each integer n > 3 not equal to 30 can be expressed as p + q with p, q^2 + q - 1 and q^2 + q + 1 all prime.
%C A230252 (iii) Any integer n > 1 can be written as x + y (x, y > 0) with x^2 + 1 (or 4*x^2+1) and y^2 + y + 1 (or 4*y^2 + 1) both prime.
%C A230252 (iv) Each integer n > 3 can be expressed as p + q (q > 0) with p, 2*p - 3 and 4*q^2 + 1 all prime.
%C A230252 (v) Any even number greater than 4 can be written as p + q with p, q and p^2 + 4 (or p^2 - 2) all prime. Also, each even number greater than 2 and not equal to 122 can be expressed as p + q with p, q and (p-1)^2 + 1 all prime.
%C A230252 We have verified the first part for n up to 10^8.

%e A230252 a(5) = 2 since 5 = 2 + 3 = 3 + 2, and 2*2+1 = 5, 2*3+1 = 7, 2^2+2+1 = 7, 3^2+3+1 = 13 are all prime.
%e A230252 a(31) = 1 since 31 = 14 + 17, and 2*14+1 = 29, 14^2+14+1 = 211 and 17^2+17+1 = 307 are all prime.
