%N A230666 Primes p such that a Heronian triangle with a fixed side length of 3 contains p as another side length.
%C A230666 The triangle inequality requires that any integer triangle with a fixed side length of 3 can have remaining side lengths of (x, x+1) or (x, x+2). The constraint that primitive Heronian triangles have only one even side will just permit (x, x+1). So a(n) = x or x+1 whenever the Heronian triangle has x or x+1 as a prime and n is the ordered occurrence of this prime. The ordered sequence of x is given by A072221 where x(n) = 6x(n-1)-x(n-2)+2, x(0)=1, x(1)=4 starting at x(1).
%F A230666 Primes of the form x(m) or x(m)+1 where x(m) is given by x(m) = 6x(m-1)-x(m-2)+2, x(0)=1, x(1)=4 starting at x(1).
%e A230666 a(2)=149 because the triangle with sides (3, 148, 149) is Heronian, 149 is prime and is the 2nd occurrence of such a prime with triangle sides (3, 4, 5) giving 5 as the 1st occurrence.
