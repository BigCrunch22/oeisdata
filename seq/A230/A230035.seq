%N A230035 Numbers which can be represented as a sum of 3 relatively prime positive integers such that each pair of them is not coprime.
%C A230035 The complement of A230034.
%C A230035 Each number beginning from 2731 is in a(n).
%C A230035 Generally for every positive integer k there is only finite quantity of numbers which can't be represented as a sum of k+1 relatively prime positive integers such that any k of them are not coprime.
%C A230035 For instance, for k = 3 570570 is the largest number which cannot be represented.
%e A230035 31 is in a(n) because 31 = 6 + 10 + 15  and gcd(6, 10, 15) = 1 however gcd(6, 10) = 2, gcd(6, 15) = 3,  gcd(10, 15) = 5.
