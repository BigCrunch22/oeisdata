%N A230781 Squared radii of circles centered at a grid point in a triangular lattice hitting exactly 6 points. Squares or triple of squares that are not expressible as x^2+xy+y^2 with y > x > 0.
%C A230781 Numbers without prime factor of form 6k+1 and without prime factor of form 3k+2 to an odd multiplicity.
%C A230781 The sequence is closed under multiplication. Primitive elements are 3 and square of primes of form 3k+2 (A003627). Sequence A003136 (Loeschian numbers) is the union of {0}, this sequence and A024606 (numbers of form x^2+xy+y^2 with y > x > 0). These 4 sequences are all closed under multiplication.
