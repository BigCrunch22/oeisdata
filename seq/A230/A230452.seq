%N A230452 Starting values for which the "comma sum" sequence (cf. A230288) does not end in 989.
%C A230452 According to the general rules, the starting value 0 ends in 1, therefore the value 0 has been included here. However, we list it with index 0 since the original sequence A230288 had been *defined* to start 0,5,11... (and ends in 989), so some might consider that 0 should not be here.
%C A230452 This sequence obviously includes all integers beyond 989.
