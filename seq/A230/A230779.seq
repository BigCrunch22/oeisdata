%N A230779 Numbers which are uniquely decomposable into a sum of two squares, the unique decomposition being with two distinct nonzero squares.
%C A230779 Numbers with exactly one prime factor of form 4*k+1, that must have multiplicity one, and no prime factor of the form 4*k+3 with odd multiplicity. There is thus no square in the sequence.
%C A230779 These are the primitive elements of A004431, the integers which are the sum of two nonzero distinct squares.
%C A230779 Numbers such that A004018(a(n)) = 8.
%C A230779 The square of these numbers is also uniquely decomposable into a sum of two squares, thus this sequence is a subsequence of A084645.
%C A230779 Also a subsequence of A191217: the two sequences are equal up to a(76) = 320, then A191217(77) = 325, the value which is missing from this sequence, as a(77) = 328 = A191217(78). (3125 is also missing from this sequence, although present in A191217, and it is the 31st such number). - Corrected by _Antti Karttunen_, May 14 2022.
%C A230779 Numbers n such that n^3 is the sum of two nonzero squares in exactly two ways. - _Altug Alkan_, Jul 01 2016
%C A230779 Sequence A125022 (numbers with a unique partition as the sum of 2 squares x^2 + y^2), but without any terms of A028982 (squares and twice squares) that might occur there. - _Antti Karttunen_, May 14 2022

%F A230779 Terms are obtained by the products A125853(k)*A002144(p) for k, p > 0, ordered by increasing values.
%F A230779 {k | A004018(k) = 8}.
%e A230779 a(1) = 5 = 4+1, a(2) = 10 = 9+1, a(3) =  13 = 9+4. However 2 = 1+1, 4 = 4+0, 8 = 4+4 are excluded because the unique decomposition of these numbers in two squares is not with two distinct nonzero squares; 25, 50, 100 are also excluded because there are two decompositions of these numbers in two squares (including one with equal or zero squares).
