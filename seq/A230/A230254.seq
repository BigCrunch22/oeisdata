%N A230254 Number of ways to write n = p + q with p and (p+1)*q/2 + 1 both prime.
%C A230254 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 3.
%C A230254 We have verified this for n up to 10^8.
%C A230254 We also have some similar conjectures, for example, any integer n > 3 not equal to 17 or 66 can be written as p + q with p and (p+1)*q/2 - 1 both prime.

%e A230254 a(15) = 1 since 15 = 5 + 10 with 5 and (5+1)*10/2+1 = 31 both prime.
%e A230254 a(30) = 1 since 30 = 2 + 28 with 2 and (2+1)*28/2+1 = 43 both prime.
