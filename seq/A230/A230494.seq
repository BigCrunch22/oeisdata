%N A230494 Number of ways to write n = x^2 + y (x, y >= 0) with 2*y^2 - 1 prime.
%C A230494 Conjecture: (i) a(n) > 0 for all n > 1. Moreover, if n > 1 is not among 2, 69, 76, then there are positive integers x and y such that x^2 + y is equal to n and 2*y^2 - 1 is prime.
%C A230494 (ii) Any integer n > 1 can be written as x*(x+1)/2 + y with 2*y^2 - 1 prime, where x and y are nonnegative integers. Moreover, if n is not equal to 2 or 15, then we may require additionally that x and y are both positive.
%C A230494 We have verified the conjecture for n up to 2*10^7.
%C A230494 Both conjectures verified for n up to 10^9. - _Mauro Fiorentini_, Aug 08 2023

%e A230494 a(9) = 1 since 9 = 1^2 + 8 with 2*8^2 - 1 = 127 prime.
%e A230494 a(69) = 1 since 69 = 0^2 + 69 with 2*69^2 - 1 = 9521 prime.
%e A230494 a(76) = 1 since 76 = 0^2 + 76 with 2*76^2 - 1 = 11551 prime.
