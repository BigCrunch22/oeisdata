%N A303462 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct terms such that the digits succession stays the same if every second digit among all sequence terms is erased.
%C A303462 The sequence starts with a(1) = 1 and is always extended with the smallest integer not used so far that doesn't lead to a contradiction. It is conjectured that this sequence is a permutation of the integers > 0.

%e A303462 The sequence starts with:

%e A303462 If 1 out of 2 digit is erased, we get:
%e A303462 1,.,2.,2.0,.,2.0,.0,.,3.,2.,1.0,.,1.0,.,4.,3.0,.,2.,1.,1.0
%e A303462 This succession of digits is the same as the starting sequence.
