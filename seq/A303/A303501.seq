%N A303501 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms such that the digits of a(n) together with the first digit of a(n+1) can be arranged to form a base-10 palindrome.
%C A303501 The sequence starts with a(1) = 1 and is always extended with the smallest integer not present that doesn't lead to a contradiction.
%C A303501 Comment from _N. J. A. Sloane_, Apr 27 2018: (Start)
%C A303501 It is not difficult to prove that a(n+1) always exists. As in the proof that A228407 contains every number, classify numbers m into 2^10 classes according to the parity of the numbers of 0's, 1's, ..., 9's they contain.  Let W(m) denote the binary weight of the class that m belongs to.
%C A303501 A necessary and sufficient condition for there to exist a digit x such that the digits of a(n) and x can be rearranged to form a palindrome is that W(a(n)) = 0 or 1. If W(a(n)) = 0 then x can be any nonzero digit, while if W(a(n)) = 1 then x can be chosen to be the digit that appears an odd number of times in a(n), as long as that digit is not zero.
%C A303501 We now choose a(n+1) to begin with x, and choose the remaining digits of a(n+1) so that the digits of a(n+1) again have the required property. (End)
