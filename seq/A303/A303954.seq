%N A303954 A fractal-like sequence: erasing all pairs of contiguous terms that don't sum up to a square leaves the sequence unchanged.
%C A303954 The sequence is fractal-like as it embeds an infinite number of copies of itself.
%C A303954 The sequence was built according to these rules (see, in the Example section, the parenthesization technique):
%C A303954   1) no overlapping pairs of parentheses;
%C A303954   2) always start the content inside a pair of parentheses with the smallest integer N not yet present inside another pair of parentheses;
%C A303954   3) always end the content inside a pair of parentheses with the smallest integer E not yet present inside another pair of parentheses such that the sum N + E is not a square number;
%C A303954   4) after a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 2, always try to extend the sequence with a duplicate of the oldest term > 5 of the sequence not yet duplicated; if this leads to a contradiction, open a new pair of parentheses.

%e A303954 Parentheses are added around each pair of terms that don't sum up to a square:
%e A303954 (1,2), (7,3), 1, (8,4), (5,6), (10,9), (16,11), (14,12), (13,15), (21,17), (19,18), (31,20), (29,22), (27,23), 2, 7, (42,24),
%e A303954 Erasing all the parenthesized contents yields
%e A303954 (...), (...), 1, (...), (...), (....), (.....), (.....), (.....), (.....), (.....), (.....), (.....), (.....), 2, 7, (.....),
%e A303954 We see that the remaining terms slowly rebuild the starting sequence.
