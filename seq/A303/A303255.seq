%N A303255 "Wondrous representation" [left to right] of positive integer n, n >= 2.
%C A303255 Start with k = 1; left to right "digits": 2 means k <= 2k, 1 means k <= (k-1)/3. (1 has the empty "wondrous representation," since it is "wondrous" by definition ... although, for a nonempty representation, we could [in a kludgy way] represent 1 using the trivial cycle: 221.)
%C A303255 "Wondrous numbers" (Hofstadter, 1979, pp. 400-401) are positive integers with a Collatz trajectory that eventually reaches 1.
%C A303255 According to the Collatz conjecture, every positive integer is "wondrous" (none is "unwondrous"). Thus, every positive integer n >= 2 is conjectured to have a "wondrous representation," which is then unique.
%C A303255 Reading the "digits" right to left gives the Collatz trajectory of n, n >= 2. Start with n; right to left "digits": 2 means k <= k/2, 1 means k <= 3k+1.
%C A303255 For a representation to be well-formed, we can only append a "digit" 1 if the number reached to the left is congruent to 4 (mod 6), yielding an odd number after appending 1. We can append "digit" 2 without any restriction. Thus a(n) is odd iff it ends with 1.
