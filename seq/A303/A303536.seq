%N A303536 Number of terms in greedy partition of n into binary palindromes.
%C A303536 The definition and early trajectory are strikingly reminiscent of A259656. The first difference between the two sequences is at n = 38, where A259656 has 4 and this sequence has 2.
%C A303536 Start with n, and repeatedly subtract the largest possible binary palindrome that leaves a nonnegative residue. This sequence gives the number of such steps needed to reach 0.
%C A303536 This sequence is unbounded, since the gaps between binary palindromes are arbitrarily large, but it grows very slowly.
%C A303536 If we search for the smallest partition into binary palindromes, not necessarily greedy, we get another sequence dominated by this one. The first difference is at n = 44. It is believed that this smaller sequence is bounded, but I have not been able to find a claim of the maximum. See Cilleruelo and Luca 2016.
%C A303536 The position where n = 0.. occurs for the first time: 0, 1, 2, 11, 44, 557, 131630, ... - _Antti Karttunen_ and _Altug Alkan_, May 13 2018

%F A303536 a(0) = 0; for n > 0, a(n) = 1 + a(A303534(n)). [We are iterating the map n -> A303534(n) until zero is reached.] - _Antti Karttunen_, May 13 2018, after an earlier comment.
%e A303536 For n = 44:
%e A303536 The largest palindrome not exceeding 44 is 33 (100001). 44 - 33 = 11.
%e A303536 The largest palindrome not exceeding 11 is 9 (1001). 11 - 9 = 2.
%e A303536 The largest palindrome not exceeding 2 is 1. 2 - 1 = 1.
%e A303536 The largest palindrome not exceeding 1 is 1. 1 - 1 = 0.
%e A303536 The iteration took 4 steps to reach 0, so a(44) = 4.
%e A303536 For n = 131630; A303534(131630) = 557 and A303534(557) = 44. Since a(44) = 4 (as above), a(557) = 5 and a(131630) = 6. - _Altug Alkan_, Apr 26 2018
