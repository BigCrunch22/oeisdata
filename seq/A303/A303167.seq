%N A303167 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct terms such that the successive quantities of digits between two successive 8's are given by the succession of the sequence's digits itself.
%C A303167 The sequence starts with a(1) = 0 and is always extended with the smallest integer not yet present that doesn't lead to a contradiction. This sequence is a permutation of the numbers >= 0.

%e A303167 There are:
%e A303167 0 digit  between the 8 of "8" and the 8 of "80";
%e A303167 1 digit  between the 8 of "80" and the 8 of "81";
%e A303167 2 digits between the 8 of "81" and the 8 of "82";
%e A303167 3 digits between the 8 of "82" and the 8 of "83";
%e A303167 4 digits between the 8 of "83" and the 8 of "18";
%e A303167 5 digits between the 8 of "18" and the 8 of "28";
%e A303167 6 digits between the 8 of "28" and the 8 of "84";
%e A303167 7 digits between the 8 of "84" and the 8 of "85";
%e A303167 8 digits between the 8 of "85" and the 8 of "38";
%e A303167 8 digits between the 8 of "38" and the first 8 of "88";
%e A303167 0 digit  between the 8's of "88";
%e A303167 8 digits between the last 8 of "88" and the 8 of "86";
%e A303167 1 digit  between the 8 of "86" and the 8 of "87";
%e A303167 etc.
%e A303167 We see that the first column here is the succession of the digits of the sequence, as well as the size of each chunk of digits between two successive 8's.
%Y A303167 Cf. A303151 for the same idea with 1's as chunk's separators, A303157 with 2's, A303158 with 3's, A302943 with 4's, A303163 with 5's, A303164 with 6's, A303166 with 7's and A303171 with 9's.
