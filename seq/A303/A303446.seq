%N A303446 Lexicographically first sequence of distinct terms such that a(n) can be recreated concatenating [the last digit(s) of a(n-1)] to [the first digit(s) of a(n+1)].
%C A303446 The sequence is started with a(1) = 1 and always extended with the smallest term not present that doesn't lead to a contradiction.
