%N A303009 Numbers n such that both A002450(n)=(2^(2n)-1)/3 and A007583(n)=2*A002450(n)+1 are Fermat pseudoprimes to base 2 (A001567).
%C A303009 It can be shown that if n is odd, it is a prime or a Fermat 4-pseudoprime (A020136) not divisible by 3. Similarly, 2n+1 is a prime or a Fermat 2-pseudoprime (A001567) not divisible by 3. In fact, the sequence is the union of the following six:
%C A303009 (i) primes n such that 2n+1 is prime (cf. A005384) and A007583(n) is composite, with smallest such term n=a(1)=23;
%C A303009 (ii) primes n==2 (mod 3) such that 2n+1 is a 2-psp (no such terms are known);
%C A303009 (iii) 4-pseudoprimes n==5 (mod 6) such that 2n+1 is prime and A007583(n) is composite, with smallest such term n=a(15)=341;
%C A303009 (iv) 4-pseudoprimes n==5 (mod 6) such that 2n+1 is 2-pseudoprime, with smallest such term n=268435455;
%C A303009 (v) n=2k, where 4k is in A015921 and k==1 (mod 3), such that 2n+1 is prime and A007583(n) is composite, with the smallest such term n=67166;
%C A303009 (vi) n=2k, where 4k is in A015921 and k==1 (mod 3), such that 2n+1 is a 2-psp, with the smallest such term n=9042986.
