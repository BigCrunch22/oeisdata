%N A303767 May code of n: a(0) = 0, and for n > 0, if n = 2^k, a(n) = n + a(n-1), otherwise, when n = 2^k + r (with 0 < r < 2^k), then a(n) = 2^k + a(r-1); see comments for equivalent alternative descriptions.
%C A303767 This is also "minimal subset/superset bitmask" transform of the nonnegative integers, A001477. In that transform, applicable to any N -> N injection f, we start from a(0) = 0, after which for n > 0, if there are one or more k_i that are not already present in the sequence among terms a(0) .. a(n-1), and for which bitor(k_i,a(n-1)) = a(n-1), then a(n) = that k_i for which f(k_i) is minimized; otherwise, a(n) = that h_i for which f(h_i) is minimized among the infinite set of numbers h_i for which bitand(h_i,a(n-1)) = a(n-1) and that are not yet present in the sequence. In this case f(n) = A001477(n) = n.
%C A303767 The original, equivalent definition is:
%C A303767 a(0) = 0 and for n > 0, if there are one or more k_i that are not already present in the sequence among terms a(0) .. a(n-1), and for which bitor(k_i,a(n-1)) = a(n-1), then a(n) = that k_i which gives minimum value of A019565(k_i) amongst them; otherwise, when no such k_i exists, a(n) = the least number not already present that can be obtained by toggling a single 0-bit of a(n-1) to 1. This is done by trying to toggle successive vacant bits from the least significant end of the binary representation of a(n-1), until such a sum a(n-1) + 2^h (= a(n-1) bitxor 2^h) is found that is not already present in the sequence.
%C A303767 Shares with permutations like A003188, A006068, A300838, A302846, A303765 and A304083 the property that when moving from any a(n) to a(n+1) either a subset of 0-bits are toggled on (changed to 1's), or a subset of 1-bits are toggled off (changed to 0's), but no both kind of changes may occur at the same step.
%C A303767 Also, like A003188, A006068 and many other base-2 representation related permutations, this permutation preserves the binary size of n (A000523(n)), and furthermore, a(n) seems to stay at most points (except at powers of 2) remarkably close to n.
%C A303767 From _Antti Karttunen_, May 23 2018: (Start)
%C A303767 Outline of the proof that the definition involving A019565 is equivalent to the recurrent formula:
%C A303767 Even though A019565 is nonmonotonic, for example A019565(4) = 5 = p_3 < A019565(3) = 6 = p_1 * p_2, and in general, although there are always primes p_k < p_{i1} * p_{i2} * ... * p_{ih}, with i1, i2, ..., ih < k, it doesn't matter here, because not just the position of the most significant 1-bit is monotonic in this sequence (see the binary representation at A304747), but also in each subrange (2^k)+2 .. (2^(k+1))-1 the position of the second most significant 1-bit moves only leftward, i.e., is monotonic, which follows from the recursive formula.
%C A303767 To see this, consider the first time in this sequence when in a batch of terms (of equal binary width) we have bits in position k (the most significant position) and (k-1) on (that is, both are 1's), the latter corresponding to prime p_k: while in principle a bit-based rule could choose to subtract 2^(k-1), in preference to any 1-bits to the right of it (that correspond to primes p_{i1} .. p_{ih}), it cannot do so at this stage, because it is the second most significant 1-bit, and then it would not move only leftward, contradicting what was said above. Neither this can occur later when more 1-bits have appeared to their left: the recursive formula guarantees it.
%C A303767 Also conversely, even though p_4 = 7 > 6 = p_1 * p_2, and in general, we always have such prime p_k > p_{i1} * p_{i2} * ... * p_{ih}, with i1, i2, ..., ih < k, and while here A019565-based rule (see comments in A303760) would prefer dividing p_k out instead of any subset of p_{i1} .. p_{ih}, it happens that in that rule, the index of the largest prime (A061395) grows monotonically, so at the stage where p_k is the largest prime of the batch of length 2^(k-1), p_k just cannot be divided out, and also here the structure of the later batches is strictly determined by recursion.
