%N A303850 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct terms such that what emerges from the mask (right-aligned) is odd (see the Comments section for the mask explanation).
%C A303850 For any pair of consecutive terms, one of the terms uses fewer digits than the other. This term is called the mask. Put the mask on the other term, starting from the right. What is not covered by the mask forms an odd number on the left.
%C A303850 The sequence starts with a(1) = 1 and is always extended with the smallest integer not yet present that doesn't lead to a contradiction.
%C A303850 This sequence is a permutation of the positive integers, as all integers will appear at some point, either as mask or masked.
%C A303850 Comparing the two b-files (the first 10000 terms), this seems to be a duplicate of A303848. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jun 23 2018
