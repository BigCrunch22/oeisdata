%N A303158 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct terms such that the successive quantities of digits between two successive 3s are given by the succession of the sequence's digits itself.
%C A303158 The sequence starts with a(1) = 0 and is always extended with the smallest integer not yet present that doesn't lead to a contradiction.
%C A303158 This sequence is a permutation of the numbers >= 0.
