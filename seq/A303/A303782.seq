%N A303782 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct terms such that what emerges from the mask is prime (see the Comment section for the mask explanation).
%C A303782 For any pair of contiguous terms, one of the terms uses fewer digits than the other. This term is called the mask. Put the mask on the other term, starting from the left. What is not covered by the mask forms a prime number.
%C A303782 The sequence starts with a(1) = 1 and is always extended with the smallest integer not yet present that doesn't lead to a contradiction.
%C A303782 This sequence is a permutation of the integers > 0, as all integers will appear at some point, either as mask or masked.
