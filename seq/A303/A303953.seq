%N A303953 A fractal-like sequence: erasing all pairs of contiguous terms that sum up to a square leaves the sequence unchanged.
%C A303953 The sequence is fractal-like as it embeds an infinite number of copies of itself.
%C A303953 The sequence was built according to these rules (see, in the Example section, the parenthesization technique):
%C A303953   1) no overlapping pairs of parentheses;
%C A303953   2) always start the content inside a pair of parentheses with the smallest integer R > 3 not yet present inside another pair of parentheses;
%C A303953   3) always end the content inside a pair of parentheses with the smallest integer E > 3 not yet present inside another pair of parentheses such that the sum R + E is a square number;
%C A303953   4) after a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 3, a(4) = 4 and a(5) = 5, always try to extend the sequence with a duplicate of the oldest term > 5 of the sequence not yet duplicated; if this leads to a contradiction, open a new pair of parentheses.

%e A303953 Parentheses are added around each pair of terms that sum up to a square:
%e A303953 1, 2, 3, (4,5), (6,10), 4, (7,9), 5, 6, (8,17), 10, 4, 7, (11,14), 9, 5, 6, 8, (12,13), 17, 10,
%e A303953 Erasing all the parenthesized contents yields
%e A303953 1, 2, 3, (...), (....), 4, (...), 5, 6, (....), 10, 4, 7, (.....), 9, 5, 6, 8, (.....), 17, 10,
%e A303953 We see that the remaining terms slowly rebuild the starting sequence.
%Y A303953 Cf. A000290 (Square numbers).
%Y A303953 For other "erasing criteria", cf. A303845 (prime by concatenation), A274329 (pair summing up to a prime), A303936 (pair not summing up to a prime), A303948 (pair sharing a digit), A302389 (pair having no digit in common), A303950 (pair summing up to a Fibonacci), A303951 (pair not summing up to a Fibonacci).
