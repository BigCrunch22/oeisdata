%N A303880 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct terms such that a(n) shares at least one even digit with a(n+1).
%C A303880 The sequence starts with a(1) = 2 and is always extended with the smallest integer not present that doesn't lead to a contradiction.
%C A303880 The sequence is not a permutation of the integers > 0 as no term of A014261 (Numbers that contain odd digits only) will ever show.
