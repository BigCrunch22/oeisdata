%N A303746 Totients t for which {x: phi(x)=t} share the same largest prime factor.
%C A303746 Terms of this sequence are totients selected by prime replicators of totients not terms of this sequence.
%C A303746 A303747 a restriction of this sequence gives a relation T = (P * TS) - TS where T is a term, P is the corresponding prime replicator and TS is the starting or seed totient. The relation fails for a(202) = 1210. 1210 does not equal (11 * a(19)) - a(19), i.e., (11 * 110) - 110.
%C A303746 For known terms, the greatest common divisor of the solutions of a(n) is either a power of the largest prime factor of solutions of a(n), or is evenly divisible by same.

%e A303746 10 is a term because the largest prime factor of 11 and 22, the solutions of phi(10) is 11.
%e A303746 2 is not a term because there is no common largest prime factor of 3, 4 and 6, the solutions of phi(2).
