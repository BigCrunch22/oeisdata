%N A303433 "Wondrous representation" [right to left] of positive integer n, n >= 2.
%C A303433 Start with k = 1; right to left "digits": 2 means k <= 2k, 1 means k <= (k-1)/3. (1 has the empty "wondrous representation," since it is "wondrous" by definition ... although, for a nonempty representation, we could [in a kludgy way] represent 1 using the trivial cycle: 122.)
%C A303433 "Wondrous numbers" (Hofstadter, 1979, pp. 400-401) are positive integers with a Collatz trajectory that eventually reaches 1.
%C A303433 According to the Collatz conjecture, every positive integer is "wondrous" (none is "unwondrous"). Thus, every positive integer n >= 2 is conjectured to have a "wondrous representation," which is then unique.
%C A303433 Reading the "digits" left to right gives the Collatz trajectory of n, n >= 2. Start with n; left to right "digits": 2 means k <= k/2, 1 means k <= 3k+1.
%C A303433 For a representation to be well-formed, we can only prepend a "digit" 1 if the number reached to the right is congruent to 4 (mod 6), yielding an odd number after prepending 1. We can prepend "digit" 2 without any restriction. Thus a(n) is odd iff it starts with 1.
