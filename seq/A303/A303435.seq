%N A303435 Numbers n such that uphi(n) (the unitary totient function A047994) is a power of the number of unitary divisors of n (A034444).
%C A303435 The unitary version of A289276.
%C A303435 Since A034444(n)=2^omega(n) is a power of 2, all the terms are products of 2 and the Fermat primes (A019434), each with multiplicity < 2, except for 3 that may be of multiplicity of 2 (since 3^2 = 2^3 + 1). If there is no 6th Fermat prime, then this sequence is finite with 33 terms.
%e A303435 2863311530 = 2 * 5 * 17 * 257 * 65537 is in the sequence since it has 2^5 unitary divisors, and its uphi value is 2^30 = (2^5)^6.
