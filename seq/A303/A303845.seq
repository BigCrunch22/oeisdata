%N A303845 A fractal-like sequence: erasing all pairs of consecutive terms that produce a prime by concatenation leaves the sequence unchanged.
%C A303845 The sequence is fractal-like as it embeds an infinite number of copies of itself.
%C A303845 The sequence was built according to these rules (see, in the Example section, the parenthesization technique):
%C A303845   1) no overlapping pairs of parentheses;
%C A303845   2) always start the content inside a pair of parentheses with the smallest integer P > 1 not yet present inside another pair of parentheses;
%C A303845   3) always end the content inside a pair of parentheses with the smallest integer R > 1 not yet present inside another pair of parentheses such that the concatenation PR is prime;
%C A303845   4) after a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 3, always try to extend the sequence with a duplicate > 1 of the oldest term of the sequence not yet duplicated; if this leads to a contradiction, open a new pair of parentheses.

%e A303845 Parentheses are added around each pair of terms whose concatenation produces a prime:
%e A303845 1,(2,3),2,(4,7),(5,9),3,2,4,(6,13),(8,11),7,5,(10,19),(12,17),(14,23),(15,31),9,...
%e A303845 Erasing all the parenthesized contents yields
%e A303845 1,(...),2,(...),(...),3,2,4,(....),(....),7,5,(.....),(.....),(.....),(.....),9,...
%e A303845 We see that the remaining terms rebuild the starting sequence.
%Y A303845 Cf. A000040 (the prime numbers), A303950 (remove parentheses with Fibonacci sum).
