%N A155700 Minimum power to which 2 must be raised so that the first n digits of the result are the digits of A155699(n).
%e A155700 The powers of 2 having at least 2 digits are 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, ...; discarding all but their first 2 digits yields the sequence 16, 32, 64, 12, 25, ..., in which all 90 of the possible 2-digit numbers (10 through 99) eventually appear; the last to appear is 97 (at 2^279 = 9.713...*10^83), so a(2) = 279.
