%N A155078 The representation of n=1,2,3,... in binary is a divisor of the same representation in another base. The sequence is the first such base.
%C A155078 The pattern of solutions for each binary representation is notable. For 1001= decimal 9, the bases as solutions are 5,8,11,14,... whereas the pattern for 111=decimal 7 is 4,9,11,16,18,....
%C A155078 The binary representation of n corresponds to the unique polynomial p_n(x) with coefficients in {0,1} such that p(2) = n. a(n) is the least x >= 3 such that p_n(x) == 0 mod n. Thus 3 <= a(n) <= n + 2. - _Robert Israel_, Dec 15 2014
%C A155078 From _RÃ©my Sigrist_, Mar 15 2017: (Start)
%C A155078 If n is even then a(n) <= max(4, n).
%C A155078 If n is odd then a(n) <= n + 2.
%C A155078 If n is odd then n and a(n) are coprime.
%C A155078 If a(n)=4 then n belongs to A062846.

%F A155078 It is simply a matter of converting a binary number to another base to see if the resulting number is a multiple of n. The lowest other base is listed.
%e A155078 The n-th term is solved by converting the decimal n to binary then asking to what other base is this representation a multiple of n. For the 5th term, the binary representation is 101; if this is converted to base 3, 101 = 9+0+1 = 10, a multiple of 5. The base 3 is the first base producing a multiple of n: the 5th term is therefore 3.
