%N A155850 a(n) = smallest k > 1 such that k-1 and k+1 together have n prime divisors.
%C A155850 Prime divisors are counted with multiplicity.
%C A155850 Similar to A155800, where k is restricted to primes.
%C A155850 Terms of the form 2^m-1 or 2^m+1 seem to occur frequently.
%e A155850 Adjacent to 2 are the numbers 1 and 3 which together have one prime divisor, hence a(1) = 2. Adjacent to 3 are 2 and 4; together they have three prime divisors, hence a(3) = 3. Adjacent to 4 are the primes 3 and 5, each having one prime divisor; hence a(2) = 4.
%e A155850 For k = 129, k-1 = 128 = 2*2*2*2*2*2*2 and k+1 = 130 = 2*5*13 together have ten prime divisors. For all numbers k < 129 the adjacent numbers k-1 and k+1 together have fewer or more than ten (for 127 there are eleven) prime divisors, hence a(10) = 129.
