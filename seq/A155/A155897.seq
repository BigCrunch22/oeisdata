%N A155897 Square matrix T(m,n)=1 if (2m+1)^n-2 is prime, 0 otherwise; read by antidiagonals.
%C A155897 In some sense a "minimal" possible generalization of the pattern of Mersenne primes (cf. A000043) is to consider powers of odd numbers (> 1) minus 2. Since even powers obviously correspond to an odd power of the base squared, it is sufficient to consider only odd powers, cf. A155899.
