%N A155817 Sequence having the property that a(n) is the sum of the first a(n) digits of the sequence.
%C A155817 From an idea of _Eric Angelini_. The condition of strict monotonicity is dropped with respect to A154328.

%e A155817 We start with a(1)=1. The next term a(2) cannot be 2,...,9 because the sum of these digits would be larger: the least possibility not leading to a contradiction is a(2)=10. Then we can go on with a(3)=2 because the sum of the first two digits, 1=a(1) and 1 from 10=a(2), is equal to 2. Then a(4)=4 because sum of the first 4 digits, 1+1+0+2, is equal to 4.
