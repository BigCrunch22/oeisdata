%N A155873 This sequence of prime numbers reproduces itself (without its "tail") when the last digit of each term is erased.
%C A155873 Sequence computed by Mensanator. The "tail" of the sequence is made from its last four terms. This is the longest possible such sequence.
%e A155873 Erasing the last digit of every term of 2 3 5 7 23 37 59 73 leaves 2 3 5 7, which is 2 3 5 7 23 37 59 73 without its "tail" (the last four integers).
%Y A155873 Cf. A024770 (right-truncatable primes: every prefix is prime).
