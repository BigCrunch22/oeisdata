%N A155087 Primes p such that Omega(c(p)) is composite, where Omega(n) is the number of prime divisors of n counted with multiplicity (A001222) and c(n) is the n-th composite number (A002808).
%e A155087 37 is such a prime as the 37th composite number is 54 and Omega(54) = Omega(2^1*3^3) = 4, which is composite. Likewise 71, as c(71) = 96, and Omega(96) = Omega(2^5*3^1) = 6 which is composite. 113 is not such a prime, as Omega(c(113)) = Omega(148) = Omega(2^2*37^1) =3 which is prime.
