%N A155885 "Look and Say" applied to the whole sequence so far.
%C A155885 a(1)=22 says "there are two 2's so far in the sequence (including my own digits)": this is true; a(2) says "there are three 2's and three 3's so far in the sequence (including my own digits)": this is true if we add the two 2's of a(1) to the unique 2 of a(2) and if we count the three 3's of a(2); etc. The sequence is finite (because there is no clear convention in noting more than 9 digits "d" under the traditional Look and Say rule; M. F. Hasler suggests for instance, that the next term could be [omitting the spaces]: 7 0 12 1 11 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 11 7 10 8 10 9).
