%N A155030 Primes p=A000040(n) with prime index n such that the concatenation n//p is a composite number.
%C A155030 Demanding that the index is not a prime would lead to A155025 instead.
%e A155030 For the index n=3, a prime, p = prime(3)=5, the concatenation 35 is composite, so p=5 is added to the sequence.
%e A155030 For the index n=5, a prime, p = prime(5)=11, the concatenation 511 is composite, so p=11 is added to the sequence.
%e A155030 For the index n=6, not a prime, nothing is added to the sequence.
%e A155030 For the index n=7, a prime, p = prime(7)=17, the concatenation 717 is composite, so p=17 is added to the sequence.
