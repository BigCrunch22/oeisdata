%N A155800 a(n) = smallest prime p such that p-1 and p+1 together have n prime divisors, or a(n) = 0 if no such prime exists.
%C A155800 Prime divisors are counted with multiplicity.

%e A155800 For p=2, the adjacent numbers 1 and 3 together have one prime divisor, hence a(1) = 2. For p=3, the adjacent numbers 2 and 4 together have three prime divisors, hence a(3) = 3. For primes greater than 3, the adjacent numbers are composite and therefore together have at least four prime divisors, so no prime exists whose neighbors together have two prime divisors. Hence a(2) = 0.
%e A155800 For p = 19, p-1 = 18 = 2*3*3 and p+1 = 20 = 2*2*5 together have six prime divisors. All smaller primes are surrounded by numbers which together have fewer or more than six (for 17 there are seven) prime divisors, hence a(6) = 19.
