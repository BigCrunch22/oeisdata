%N A155898 Square matrix T(m,n)=1 if (2m+1)^(2n)-2 is prime, 0 otherwise; read by antidiagonals.
%C A155898 In some sense the "minimal" possible generalization of the pattern of Mersenne primes (cf. A000043) is to consider powers of odd numbers minus 2. Here only even powers are considered (which obviously correspond to an odd power of the base squared).
