%N A195898 Smallest possible largest number in a set of n integers such that the sum of any two numbers is a positive cube.
%C A195898 Here, the smallest number is negative (since we need the smallest such largest number) and the remaining numbers are positive (since the condition is about positive cubes).

%e A195898 { -35780, 4693243, 11888132, 70993724 } is the smallest set of 4 numbers such that all 6 combinations of sum of any two numbers is a perfect cube. For example, -35780 + 70993724 = 414^3 and 4693243 + 11888132 = 255^3.
%e A195898 { -13, 13, 14 } is the smallest set of 3 numbers where all 3 combinations of sum of any two numbers is a perfect cube.
%e A195898 { -1, 1 } is the trivial set of two numbers because -1 + 1 = 0^3.
