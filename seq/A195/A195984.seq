%N A195984 The size of the smallest boundary square in simple perfect squared rectangles of order n.
%C A195984 Ian Gambini showed in his thesis that the minimum value for a(n) is 5. Brian Trial found 3 simple perfect squared rectangles (SPSRs) of order 28 with boundary squares of size 5 in September 2011. An unsolved problem is to find the lowest order SPSR with a '5 on the side'.
%C A195984 Added a(22) = 6 (Stuart Anderson), Brian Trial has found a(28) = 5. This gives an upper bound of 28, in addition to the lower bound of 23, to the problem of finding the lowest order SPSR with a square of size 5 on the boundary. - _Stuart E Anderson_, Sep 29 2011
%C A195984 Found a(23) = 8, the lower bound is now order 24. - _Stuart E Anderson_, Nov 30 2012
%C A195984 Found a(24) = 7, the lower bound is now order 25. - _Stuart E Anderson_, Dec 07 2012
