%e A195844 The decimal expansion of e = 2.7182818284590452353602... starts with 2 (see A001113) hence the first leader in the race of digits is 2, so a(1) = 2. After 8 stages the new leader is 8 because the number 8 appears three times and the earlier leader appears twice, so a(2) = 8. After 23 stages the new leader is 2 because the number 2 appears five times and the earlier leader appears four times, so a(3) = 2.
