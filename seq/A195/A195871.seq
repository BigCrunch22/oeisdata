%N A195871 a(n) is the smallest prime(m) such that the interval (prime(m)*n, prime(m+1)*n) contains exactly one prime.
%C A195871 Conjecture: In the supposition that there are infinitely many twin primes, for n>=5 all terms are in A001359 (lesser of twin primes).
%C A195871 Note that a unique prime which is contained in an interval of the form (prime(m)*n, prime(m+1)*n) is called n-isolated (see author's link, where a heuristic proof is given that the number of n-isolated primes<=x approaches e^{-2(n-1)}x/log(x) as x goes to infinity (cf. Conjecture 25, Remark 26 and formula (47)). One can easily prove that a(n) is not bounded.
%C A195871 This conjecture seems hard, since it's not obvious how to find an upper bound for a(n) (see Conjecture 42 in the Shevelev link). - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Jan 02 2013

%e A195871 Let n=5, and consider intervals of the form (5*prime(m), 5*prime(m+1)).
%e A195871 For 2, 3, 5, ..., the intervals (10,15), (15,25), (25,35), (35,55), (55,65), (65,85), (85,95)... contain 2, 3, 2, 5, 2, 4, 1,... primes. Hence the smallest such prime is 17.
