%e A195846 Since sqrt(2) = 1.414213562373095048801688724209698... the decimal expansion of square root of 2 starts with 1 (see A000796) hence the first leader in the race of digits is 1, so a(1) = 1. After 34 stages the new leader is 8 because the number 8 appears five times and the earlier leader appears four times, so a(2) = 8.
