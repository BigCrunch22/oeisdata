%N A195207 Number of even divisors of !n.
%C A195207 !n is a subfactorial number (A000166).
%C A195207 Property of this sequence : for n different of 3, the number of even divisors of !n seems even.
%e A195207 a(7) = 6 because the divisors of  !7 = 1854 are  {1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 103, 206, 309, 618, 927, 1854}with 6  even divisors  2, 6, 18, 206, 618, 1854 => 6 is in the sequence.
%t A195207 f[n_] := Block[{d = Divisors[Subfactorial[n]]}, Count[EvenQ[d], True]]; Table[f[n], {n, 0, 60}]
