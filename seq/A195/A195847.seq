%N A195847 Leaders in the race of digits of Euler's constant (or Euler-Mascheroni constant) gamma.
%C A195847 This is A280811 with repeats removed. - _Bobby Jacobs_, Jan 12 2017
%e A195847 The decimal expansion of gamma = 0.5772156649015... starts with 0 hence the first leader in the race of digits is 0, so a(1) = 0.
%e A195847 After four stages the new leader is 7 because the number 7 appears twice and the earlier leader appears once, so a(2) = 7.
%e A195847 After 14 stages the new leader is 5 because the number 5 appears three times and the earlier leader appears twice, so a(3) = 5.
%Y A195847 Cf. A001620, A195835, A195844, A195845, A195846, A280811.
