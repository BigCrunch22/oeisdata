%N A195050 Square array T(n,k) read by antidiagonals in which column k lists the number of divisors of n that are divisible by k.
%C A195050 It appears that the sequence formed by starting with an initial set of k-1 zeros followed by the members of A000005, with k-1 zeros between every one of them, can be defined as "the number of divisors of n that are divisible by k", (k >= 1). For example: if k = 1 we have A000005 by definition; if k = 2 we have A183063. Note that if k >= 3 the sequences are not included in the OEIS because the usual OEIS policy is not to include sequences with interspersed zeros. A183063 is an exception.
%C A195050 It appears that the illustration of initial terms of column k can be represented by a general diagram in which the period of the smallest curve is 2*k, hence the distance between consecutive two nodes is equal to k. (For k = 1 see the link.)
