%N A195354 Records of primes p in the representation of odd n>5 by n=2*p+q, p, q prime, q maximal. A195353 gives the values of n at which an increase of p is required.
%C A195354 Values of records in A195352. Related to Lemoine's conjecture. Due to the large number of possible representations (A046927) it is both possible to represent n=2*p+q with q<<p (A194829) and with p<<q (this sequence).
%C A195354 Checked up to n=10^13.
%D A195354 See A002091.
