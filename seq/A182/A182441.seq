%N A182441 Table, read by antidiagonals, in which the n-th row comprises A214206(n) in position 0 followed by a second order recursive series G in which each product G(i)*G(i+1) lies in the same row of A001477 (interpreted as a square array - see below).
%C A182441 This is a table related to the square array of the nonnegative integers (A001477). Each row k contains A003056(14*k) in column 0 and a corresponding 2nd order recursive sequence G(k) beginning at position a(k,1).  That is each term G(i) is a(k,i+1).  If A002262(14*n) is "r", the product of adjacent terms G(i)*G(i+1) if greater than (r^2 + 3*r - 2)/2, is always in row "r" of the square array A001477. If the product is less than (r^2 + 3*r -2)/2, then the product could still be said to lie in the same row r since the product is equal to the sum of a triangular number + r, which is a property of all numbers in row r of the square array A002262.
%C A182441 A property of this table is that a(k+1,i)-a(k,i) directly depends on the value of a(k+1,0)-a(k,0) in the same manner regardless of the value of k. For instance, wherever a(k+1,0)-a(k,0) = 0, a(k+1,i+1)-a(k,i+1) = A212329.  Also, a(k+1,n+2)-a(k,n+2) is divisible by A143608(n).
%F A182441 a(k,0) equals the largest m such that m*(m+1)/2 <= 14*k (A003056(14*k)).
%F A182441 a(k,1) equals k; a(k,2) = 14.
%F A182441 For i > 2, a(k,i) = 6*a(k,i-1) -a (k,i-2) + G_k where G_k is a constant equal to 28 + 2*k + 2 + 4*A003056(14*k).
%e A182441 For i>0 a(0,i) * a(0,i+1) = 0*14,14*114,114*700,700*4116,etc. which are all triangular numbers and lie in row 0 of square array A001477, while a(1,i)*a(1.i+1) = 1*14, 14*131, 131*820, 820*4837 etc. which are all 4 more than a triangular number and lie in row 4 of square array A001477.
