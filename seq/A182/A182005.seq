%N A182005 Let s(n) = s_3(n) be digit sum of n in base 3. Consider iterations: a_1(n) = s(2^n), a_2(n) = s(2^n+a_1(n)),a_3(n)=s(2^n+a_2(n)),...The sequence lists those n for which these iterations are (eventually) periodic with period > 1.
%C A182005 For every number n which is not in the sequences, there exists N=N(n) such that, for k>N, a_k(n)=constant(k).
%F A182005 Enlarged on 1 numbers which are not in A169655.
