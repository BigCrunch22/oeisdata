%N A182660 a(2^(k+1)) = k; 0 everywhere else.
%C A182660 A surjection N->N designed to spite a guesser who is trying to guess whether it's a surjection, using the following naive guessing method: Guess that (n0,...,nk) is a subsequence of a surjection iff it contains every natural less than log_2(k+1).
%C A182660 This sequence causes the would-be guesser to change his mind infinitely often.
%C A182660 a(0)=0. Assume a(0),...,a(n) have been defined.
%C A182660 If the above guesser guesses that (a(0),...,a(n)) IS the beginning of a surjective sequence, then let a(n+1)=0. Otherwise let a(n+1) be the least number not in (a(0),...,a(n)).
