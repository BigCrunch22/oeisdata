%N A182885 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of weighted lattice paths in L_n having k (1,0)-steps of weight 2. These are paths that start at (0,0) , end on the horizontal axis and whose steps are of the following four kinds: an (1,0)-step with weight 1; an (1,0)-step with weight 2; a (1,1)-step with weight 2; a (1,-1)-step with weight 1. The weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its steps.
%C A182885 Sum of entries in row n is A051286(n).
%C A182885 T(n,0)=A098479(n).
%C A182885 Sum(k*T(n,k), k=0..n)=A182886(n).

%e A182885 T(3,1)=2. Indeed, denoting by h (H) the (1,0)-step of weight 1 (2), and u=(1,1), d=(1,-1), the five paths of weight 3 are ud, du, hH, Hh, and hhh; two of them have exactly one H step.
