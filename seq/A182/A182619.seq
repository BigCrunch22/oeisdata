%N A182619 Number of vertices that are connected to two edges in a spiral without holes constructed with n hexagons.
%C A182619 The structure shows a hexagonal growth as in A182618.
%C A182619 a(n) is the number of vertices of the convex parts of the perimeter of the structure.
%C A182619 This sequence can be constructed geometrically in the following manner: Construct a gapless array of n equal circles with the rule of always choosing an arrangement with the maximum number of completely enclosed inner circles. Then, a(n) equals the number of circles required to create a kissing perimeter around the original array. Examples: a(1) = 6 because it takes 6 circles to create a kissing perimeter around 1 circle. a(7) = 12 because it takes 12 circles to create a kissing perimeter around 7 circles, which are arranged with 1 circle in center surrounded by 6 kissing circles. One could describe this as the "kissing numbers of kissing circles" sequence. - _Peter Woodward_, Apr 25 2015
%C A182619 a(n) is also the size of the smallest hexagonal polyomino that admits a hole of size n (Cf. A257594). - _Luca Petrone_, Feb 28 2017
%e A182619 For n=1 there is 1 hexagon, so a(1)= 6 because there are 6 vertices that are connected to two edges.
%e A182619 For n=2 there are 2 connected hexagons, so a(2)= 8 because there are 8 vertices that are connected to two edges.
%e A182619 For n=3 there are 3 connected hexagons, so a(3)= 9 because there are 9 vertices that are connected to two edges.
%e A182619 If written as a triangle, begins:
