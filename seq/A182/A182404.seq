%N A182404 Numbers whose digit sum as well as sum of the squares of the digits is a prime.
%C A182404 Note that the cube analog "Numbers whose digit sum as well as sum of the cubes of the digits is a prime" only occurs when A007953(n) = Digital sum (i.e., sum of digits) of n) = 2, as otherwise A055012(n) = Sum of cubes of digits of n = 2, i.e., n = 2, 11, 20, 101, 110, 1001, 1010, ... since for natural numbers A^3 + B^3 is divisible by A+B. Hence "Numbers whose digit sum as well as sum of the cubes of the digits is a prime" begins 2, 11, 101, ... . - _Jonathan Vos Post_, May 10 2012
%e A182404 25 is here because 2 + 5 = 7 and 2*2 + 5*5 = 29 both are prime.
