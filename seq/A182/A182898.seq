%N A182898 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of weighted lattice paths in L_n having k returns to the horizontal axis (both from above and below). The members of L_n are paths of weight n that start at (0,0) , end on the horizontal axis and whose steps are of the following four kinds: an (1,0)-step with weight 1, an (1,0)-step with weight 2, a (1,1)-step with weight 2, and a (1,-1)-step with weight 1. The weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its steps.
%C A182898 Sum of entries in row n is A051286(n).
%C A182898 T(n,0)=A000045(n+1) (the Fibonacci numbers).
%C A182898 Sum(k*T(n,k), k=0..n)=A182899(n).

%F A182898 G.f.:  G(t,z) =1/[1-z-z^2-2tz^3*c], where c satisfies c = 1+zc+z^2*c+z^3*c^2.
%F A182898 The trivariate g.f. H=H(t,s,z), where t (s) marks (1,-1)-returns ((1,1)-returns) to the horizontal axis, and z marks weight is given by H=1+zH+z^2*H+(t+s)z^3*cH, where c satisfies c = 1+zc+z^2*c+z^3*c^2.
%e A182898 T(3,1)=2. Indeed, denoting by h (H) the (1,0)-step of weight 1 (2), and u=(1,1), d=(1,-1), the five paths of weight 3 are ud, du, hH, Hh, and hhh; two of them, namely ud and du, have 1 return to the horizontal axis.
