%N A182177 Beginning with 0, smallest positive integer not yet in the sequence such that two adjacent digits of the sequence (also ignoring commas between terms) sum to a prime.
%C A182177 A219250 is the analog of this sequence, replacing "sum" by "absolute difference".  A219249 is the same analog for A182178. A219248 is the analog of A182175 and A219251 corresponds to A219110 = terms which do not occur in this sequence, i.e., the complement of its range. - _M. F. Hasler_, Apr 12 2013
%e A182177 41 appears after 7 because 7+4 is prime and 4+1 is prime, and no other number less than 41 (not already in the sequence) satisfies this property. Example: 11 does not directly follow 7 since 7+1 is not prime.
