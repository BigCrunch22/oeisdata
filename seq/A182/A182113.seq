%N A182113 Lexicographically earliest permutation of the positive integers such that a(n+a(n)+1) has the same parity as a(n).
%C A182113 a(n+a(n)+1) is the term reached by "jumping over" a(n) terms to the right of a(n).

%e A182113 a(1)=1 means that jumping over its neighbor we will land on a(3) which must have the same parity as a(1).
%e A182113 a(2)=2 means that jumping over a(3), a(4), we will land on a(5) which must be even, as is a(2). Therefore a(5) cannot equal 5 (which would be the least available number not yet used), the least possible choice is a(5)=6 (after having filled in a(3) with the least unused odd number, and a(4) with the least unused number without restriction).
