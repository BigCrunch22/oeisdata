%N A182364 a(1) = 0; a(n) = smallest integer not yet in this sequence S such that two neighboring digits of S sum to a semiprime  (4, 6, 9, 10, 14, or 15).
%C A182364 This is to A001358 (semiprimes) as Eric Angelini's "Smallest integer not yet in S such that two neighboring digits of S sum up to a prime", is to A000040 (primes). Corrected and extended by Hans Havermann.
%e A182364 a(2) = 4 because 4 is the smallest integer k such that a(0) + k is a semiprime (2*2 = 4).
