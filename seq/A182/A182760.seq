%N A182760 Beatty sequence for (3 + 5^(-1/2))/2.
%C A182760 Suppose that u and v are positive real numbers for which the sets S(u)={ju} and S(v)={kv}, for j>=1 and k>=1, are disjoint.  Let a(n) be the position of nu when the numbers in S(u) and S(v) are jointly ranked.  Then, as is easy to prove, a is the Beatty sequence of the number r=1+u/v, and the complement of a is the Beatty sequence of s=1+v/u.  For A182760, take u = golden ratio = (1+sqrt(5))/2 and v=sqrt(5), so that r=(3+5^(-1/2))/2 and s=(7-5^(-1/2)/2.

%e A182760 Let u=(1+sqrt(5))/2 and v=sqrt(5).  When the numbers ju and kv are jointly ranked, we write U for numbers of the form ju and V for the others.  Then the ordering of the ranked numbers is given by U V U V U U V U V U V U U ..  The positions of U are given by A182760.
