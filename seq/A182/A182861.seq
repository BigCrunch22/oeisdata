%N A182861 Number of distinct prime signatures represented among the unitary divisors of A025487(n).
%C A182861 a(n) = number of members m of A025487 such that d(m^k) divides d(A025487(n)^k) for all values of k. (Here d(n) represents the number of divisors of n, or A000005(n).)

%F A182861 a(n) = A000005(A181820(n)).
%F A182861 If the canonical factorization of n into prime powers is Product p^e(p), then the formula for d(n^k) is Product_p (ek + 1). (See also A146289, A146290.)
%e A182861 60 has 8 unitary divisors (1, 3, 4, 5, 12, 15, 20 and 60). Primes 3 and 5 have the same prime signature, as do 12 (2^2*3) and 20 (2^2*5); each of the other four numbers listed is the only unitary divisor of 60 with its particular prime signature.  Since a total of 6 distinct prime signatures appear among the unitary divisors of 60, and since 60 = A025487(13), a(13) = 6.
