%N A182656 Floor-sum sequence of r, with r=sqrt(3), and a(1)=1, a(2)=2.
%C A182656 Let S be the set generated by these rules:  (1) if m and n are in S and m<n, then floor(mr+nr) is in S; (2) two or more specific numbers are in S.  The floor-sum sequence determined by (1) and (2) results by arranging the elements of S in strictly increasing order.
%C A182656 Let B be the Beatty sequence of r. Then a floor-sum sequence of r is a subsequence of B if and only if a(1) and a(2) are terms of B.
%e A182656 a(3)=floor(r+2r)=5.
