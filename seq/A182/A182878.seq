%N A182878 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of lattice paths L_n of weight n having length k (0 <= k <= n). These are paths that start at (0,0) and end on the horizontal axis and whose steps are of the following four kinds: a (1,0)-step with weight 1, a (1,0)-step with weight 2, a (1,1)-step with weight 2, and a (1,-1)-step with weight 1.
%C A182878 The weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its steps.
%C A182878 Sum of entries in row n is A051286(n).
%C A182878 Sum_{k=0..n} k*T(n,k) = A182879(n).

%e A182878 Denoting by h (H) the (1,0)-step of weight 1 (2), and u=(1,1), d=(1,-1), the five paths of weight 3 are hhh, hH, Hh, ud, and du, having lengths 3, 2, 2, 2, and 2, respectively.
