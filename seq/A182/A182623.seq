%N A182623 Numbers n with property that there is a number m such that if we concatenate the binary representations of the divisors of m in increasing order we get the binary representation of n.
%C A182623 Numbers of A182622 in increasing order (without repetitions).
%e A182623 858 written in base 2 is 1101011010. The string "1101011010" may be broken up into four parts (1, 10, 101, 1010) that are also the binary representations of a sequence of numbers in increasing order: 1, 2, 5, 10. These numbers are the divisors of 10. Then 858 is in the sequence.
