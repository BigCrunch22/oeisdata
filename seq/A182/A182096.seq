%N A182096 Number of simple graphs with n unlabeled vertices with the degree of each vertex a prime number.
%C A182096 A simple graph, also called a strict graph, is an unweighted, undirected graph containing no graph loops or multiple edges. Given an undirected graph, a degree sequence is a monotonic nonincreasing sequence of the vertex degrees (valencies) of its graph vertices.

%e A182096 a(3) = 1 because there is a unique graph with 3 vertices each having prime degree, the triangle, with degree sequence (2,2,2).
%e A182096 a(4) = 3 because there are 3 graphs with 4 vertices each having prime degree: the 4-cycle (2,2,2,2); the complete graph K_4 with degree sequence (3,3,3,3); and two triangle graphs sharing a common edge, with degree sequence (3,3,2,2).
%e A182096 a(5) = 4 because there are 4 graphs with 5 vertices each having prime degree: the 5-cycle with degree sequence (2,2,2,2,2); a square graph sharing an edge with a triangle graph (G_13 in the linked-to illustration) with degree sequence (3,3,2,2,2); G_14 in the linked-to illustration with degree sequence (3,3,2,2,2); G_18 in the linked-to illustration with degree sequence (3,3,3,3,2).
