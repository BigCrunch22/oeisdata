%N A182903 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of weighted lattice paths in L_n having k peaks.The members of L_n are paths of weight n that start at (0,0), end on the horizontal axis and whose steps are of the following four kinds: an (1,0)-step with weight 1, an (1,0)-step with weight 2, a (1,1)-step with weight 2, and a (1,-1)-step with weight 1. The weight of a path is the sum of the weights of its steps. A peak is a (1,1)-step followed by a (1,-1)-step.
%C A182903 Number of entries in row n is 1+floor(n/3).
%C A182903 Sum of entries in row n is A051286(n).
%C A182903 T(n,0)= A182904(n).
%C A182903 Sum(k*T(n,k), k>=0)=A182884(n-2).

%F A182903 Let F=F(t,s,x,y,z) be the 5-variate g.f. of the considered weighted lattice paths, where z marks weight, t (s) marks number of peaks (valleys), x (y) indicates that the path starts with a (1,1)-step ((1,-1)-step). Then F(t,s,x,y,z)=1+z(1+z)F(t,s,1,1,z)+xz^3[t+H(t,s,z)-1]F(t,s,s,1,z)+yz^3[s+H(s,t,z)-1]F(t,s,1,t,z), where H=H(t,s,z) is given by H=1+zH+z^2*H+z^3*(t-1+H)[s(H-1-zH-z^2*H)+1+zH+z^2*H] (see A182900).
%e A182903 T(7,2)=3. Indeed, denoting by h (H) the (1,0)-step of weight 1 (2), and U=(1,1), D=(1,-1), we have hUDUD, UDhUD, UDUDh.
