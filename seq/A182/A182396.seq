%N A182396 a(n) is the least number not occurring earlier such that neighboring digits sum to 1 or 10.
%C A182396 "Number" means "nonnegative integer", or "positive integer", starting at a(1)=1.
%C A182396 Starting with 0 or 1, the sequence contains only the digits {0,1,9}. Starting the sequence with another digit > 1 seems to lead to a sequence alternating this initial digit and (10 minus that digit): E.g., 2,8,28,282,82,828,... or 5,55,555,5555,55555,....
%C A182396 Consider the function "sad" (for "sum of adjacent digits") which maps any set S and initial term x to the sequence a = sad(S,x) defined by a(0)=x, a(n+1) = the least positive integer not occurring earlier such that the sum of any two adjacent digits is in S. Then, if max(S) < 10, the sequence will be finite, ending with the first term which ends with the digit max(S) (or with x for S={}). If S={s} with 9<s<19, then the sequence cannot start with 0; if it starts with s-10 < d < 10, then the sequence consists of alternating digits d,s-d,d*10+s-d,... (see the above examples with s=10, d=5 and d=2). In this sense, the present sequence A182396=sad({1,10},0) is the "least nontrivial" sequence of this class.
