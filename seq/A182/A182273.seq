%N A182273 Starting with 1, smallest integer not having a zero and not yet in the sequence such that two neighboring digits of the sequence multiply to a composite.
%C A182273 The number after 1 has to be 4, because the product 1*4 must be composite.
%C A182273 Then 2 is OK, because 4*2 = 8 is composite.
%C A182273 Then 3, because 2*3 = 6 is composite, and so on.
%C A182273 Note that 14 is the term after 9 because 10 is now the smallest candidate, but 10 has a 0 digit, 11 consists of two unit digits, and 12 and 13 have digit products 2 and 3, which are prime. - _T. D. Noe_, Apr 25 2012
