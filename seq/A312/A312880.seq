%N A312880 Coordination sequence Gal.6.497.4 where Gal.u.t.v denotes the coordination sequence for a vertex of type v in tiling number t in the Galebach list of u-uniform tilings.
%C A312880 Note that there may be other vertices in the Galebach list of u-uniform tilings with u <= 6 that have this same coordination sequence. See the Galebach link for the complete list of A-numbers for all these tilings.
%C A312880 Gfun suggests a generating function which has about same number of degrees of freedom as the data, so is unreliable. Needs a b-file! - _N. J. A. Sloane_, Sep 23 2018
