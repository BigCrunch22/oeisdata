%N A290633 Lexicographically earliest sequence of positive integers such that, for any m and n > 0, gcd(a(n), a(n+1)) > 1 and a(n) != a(n+2), and if m < n then a(m) != a(n) or a(m+1) != a(n+1).
%C A290633 a(n) > 1 for any n > 0.
%C A290633 If we drop the constraint "a(n) != a(n+2)", then we obtain the positive even numbers interspersed with 2's: 2, 2, 4, 2, 6, ...
%C A290633 Conjecturally, (a(n), a(n+1)) runs over all pairs of noncoprime positive integers; in this sense, this sequence is opposite to sequences like Stern's diatomic series (A002487).
%C A290633 This sequence has connections with A067992: here we avoid duplicate ordered pairs of consecutive terms, there unordered pairs, here we deal with noncoprime consecutive terms, there we (conjecturally) have coprime consecutive terms; also, the scatterplots of these sequences have similarities.
%C A290633 For any prime p, the sequence contains a multiple of p: by contradiction:
%C A290633 - let p be the least prime whose multiples are missing from the sequence (note that p > 2),
%C A290633 - there is only a finite number of pairs of noncoprime (p-1)-smooth numbers < p^2,
%C A290633 - so eventually we must have a term, say a(m), > p^2,
%C A290633 - if q is the least prime factor of a(m-1), then p*q would have been a better choice for a(m), hence the contradiction.
%C A290633 Also, if p is an odd prime, then the first multiple of p appearing in the sequence is a semiprime p*q with q < p.
%C A290633 If p < q are prime, then the first multiple of p appears before the first multiple of q.
%C A290633 For any prime p, the first occurrence of p in the sequence is immediately followed by a second occurrence of p.
%C A290633 For any prime p > 3:
%C A290633 - there is a semiprime p*q with q < p in the sequence,
%C A290633 - if q = 2, then this first p*q is followed by a 4,
%C A290633 - if q > 2, then this first p*q is followed by a 2,
%C A290633 - so there are infinitely many 2's or 4's in the sequence,
%C A290633 - if there are infinitely many 2's in the sequence, then the n-th occurrence of 2 is followed by 2*(n+e) with |e| <= 1, and every even
%C A290633   number appears in the sequence,
%C A290633 - the same conclusion applies if there are infinitely many 4's,
%C A290633 - hence every even number appear in the sequence.
%C A290633 For any n > 1, the first occurrence of n in the sequence must be either preceded or followed by the least prime factor of n (A020639).
