%N A290560 Generalized Lucas-Carmichael numbers for D=9697.
%C A290560 On the set Lc(Z/NZ,D) = {(x,y) in (Z/NZ)^2 : x^2 - Dy^2 = 1 (mod N)}, define an operation as follows: (x,y)x(z,w) = (xz+Dyw, xw+zy) (mod N). The set Lc(Z/NZ, D) endowed with this operation is a group. Moreover, the set of Lucas numbers endowed with this operation is a subgroup of Lc(Z/NZ, D).
%C A290560 The following results appear in Babinkostova, et al.: If q is a prime, then #Lc(Z/(q^e)Z, D) = (q-(D|q))q^(e-1).
%C A290560 The group Lc(Z/(q^e)Z, D) is cyclic for e > 0. This result was proven in Hinkel, 2007 for the case when e = 1. We showed that the statement is true for e > 1 (Babinkostova, et al.).
%C A290560 The following notions are introduced in Babinkostova, et al.: A composite integer N is a generalized Lucas pseudoprime (or Lucas pseudoprime in Babinkostova, et al.) to base P in Lc(Z/NZ, D) and integer D if (N-(D|N))P = O, where O is the identity of the group.
%C A290560 We define a composite integer N to be a generalized Lucas-Carmichael number if for all P in Lc(Z/NZ, D) it is true that (N-(D|N))P = O.
%C A290560 The following Korselt-like criterion holds for a generalized Lucas-Carmichael number: A composite number N is a generalized Lucas-Carmichael number if and only if N is squarefree and for every prime factor q of N, (q-(D|q)) divides (N-(D|N)).
%C A290560 This sequence is a list of generalized Lucas-Carmichael numbers for D=9697.
%C A290560 For prime values of D less than 10000 and odd nonprime values of N less than 1000000, this is the longest sequence of generalized Lucas-Carmichael numbers.
%C A290560 The resulting sequence of generalized Lucas-Carmichael numbers is based on work done by L. Babinkostova, B. Bentz, M. I. Hassan, and H. Kim.

%e A290560 We will illustrate an example using the Korselt criterion for generalized Lucas pseudoprimes. Let us observe the second term, 35. Note that 35 = 5*7, so that it is squarefree. Now note that (5-(9697|5)) = 6 and (7-(9697|7)) = 6, both of which divide (35-(9697|35)) = 36. Therefore, by the Korselt criterion for generalized Lucas pseudoprimes, we have that 35 is a generalized Lucas Carmichael number for D = 9697.
