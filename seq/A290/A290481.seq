%N A290481 The number of 3-Carmichael numbers that are divisible by the n-th odd prime.
%C A290481 Beeger proved in 1950 that if p < q < r are primes such that p*q*r is a 3-Carmichael number, then q < 2p^2 and r < p^3. Therefore the number of 3-Carmichael numbers that are divisible by a fixed prime is finite.
%C A290481 The terms were calculated using Pinch's tables of Carmichael numbers (see link below).

%e A290481 There is only one 3-Carmichael number that is divisible by 3 (561); there are three that are divisible by 5 (1105, 2465 and 10585) and six that are divisible by 7 (1729, 2821, 6601, 8911, 15841 and 52633). Thus a(1)=1, a(2)=3 and a(3)=6.
