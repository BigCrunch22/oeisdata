%N A290966 The number of convex layers in an n X n grid of points.
%C A290966 The convex layers of a point set are obtained by finding the convex hull, removing its vertices, and continuing recursively with the remaining points.
%C A290966 As can be seen in the subsequence 122, 129, 129, 135, the nonzero differences of consecutive sequence values do not grow monotonically.

%F A290966 For every n, a(2n) = a(2n-1).
%F A290966 As Har-Peled and Lidicky (2013) proved, this sequence grows proportionally to n^{4/3}.
%e A290966 For n=3, the a(3)=3 convex layers of a 3 X 3 grid are (1) the four corner points, (2) the four side midpoints, and (3) the center point.
