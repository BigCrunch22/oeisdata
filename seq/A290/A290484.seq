%N A290484 Odd prime numbers that are factors of only one 3-Carmichael number.
%C A290484 Beeger proved in 1950 that if p < q < r are primes such that p*q*r is a 3-Carmichael number, then q < 2p^2 and r < p^3. Therefore there is a finite number of 3-Carmichael numbers which divisible by a given prime.
%C A290484 The terms were calculated using Pinch's tables of Carmichael numbers (see link below).
