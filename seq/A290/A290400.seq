%N A290400 Primes p such that Diophantine equation x + y + z = p with x*y*z = k^3 (0 < x <= y <= z) has a unique solution.
%H A290400 Tianxin Cai and Deyi Chen, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1090/S0025-5718-2013-02685-3">A new variant of the Hilbert-Waring problem</a>, Math. Comp. 82 (2013), 2333-2341.
%e A290400 7 is in the sequence since, of the triples whose sum is 7, i.e., (1, 1, 5), (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 3), and (2, 2, 3), only one (i.e., (1, 2, 4)), yields a cube as its product: 1 * 2 * 4 = 8 = 2^3.
%e A290400 31 is not here, since the corresponding equation has two solutions: (1, 5, 25) and (1, 12, 18).
%Y A290400 Cf. A000040, A000578, A233386.
