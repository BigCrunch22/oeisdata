%N A290169 a(n) = least k such that both the sum of the smallest n divisors of k and the sum of its greatest n divisors are prime numbers.
%C A290169 The corresponding pairs of primes are (3, 3), (7, 7), (11, 61), (31, 31), (29, 307), (127, 127), (47, 673), (61, 379), (73, 919), ...
%C A290169 The sequence contains a subsequence of numbers having the property that the sum of the first n divisors is equal to the sum of the last n divisors; for instance, for a(n) = 2, 4, 16 and 64 with n = 2, 3, 5 and 7. Is it possible to conjecture that this subsequence contains all the superperfect numbers (A019279)? The answer is no: for instance, A019279(5) = 4096 = 2^12 => the sum of the 13 terms 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... + 4096 = 8191 is a Mersenne prime, but a(13) = 800 instead 4096 > 800, and we obtain the corresponding pair of primes (293, 1933) instead (8191, 8191).
%C A290169 The squares of the terms of the sequence are 4, 16, 64, 144, 576, 1296, 1600, 2304, ...

%e A290169 a(4)=30 because both the sum of the first 4 divisors of 30 (1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 11) and the sum of its last 4 divisors (30 + 15 + 10 + 6 = 61) are prime numbers.
