%N A290342 Number of ways to write n as x^2 + 2*y^2 + z*(z+1)/2, where x is a nonnegative integer, and y and z are positive integers.
%C A290342 Conjecture: a(n) > 0 for all n > 2. In other words, each n = 0,1,2,... can be written as x^2 + 2y*(y+2) + z*(z+3)/2 with x,y,z nonnegative integers.
%C A290342 As pointed out by Sun in his 2007 paper in Acta Arith., a result of Jones and Pall implies that every n = 0,1,2,... can be written as x^2 + 2*(2y)^2 + z*(z+1)/2 with x,y,z nonnegative integers.
%C A290342 Let a,c,e be positive integers, and let b,d,f be nonnegative integers with a-b, c-d, e-f all even. Suppose that a|b, c|d and e|f. The author studied in arXiv:1502.03056 when each nonnegative integer can be written as x*(a*x+b)/2 + y*(c*y+d)/2 + z*(e*z+f)/2 with x,y,z nonnegative integers, and conjectured that the answer is positive if (a,b,c,d,e,f) is among the following ten tuples (4,0,2,0,1,3), (4,0,2,0,1,5), (4,0,2,6,1,1), (4,0,2,6,2,0), (4,4,2,0,1,3), (4,8,2,0,1,1), (4,8,2,0,1,3), (4,12,2,0,1,1), (6,0,2,0,1,3), (6,6,2,0,1,3).
