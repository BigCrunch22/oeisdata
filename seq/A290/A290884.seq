%N A290884 Let S be the sequence generated by these rules: 0 is in S, and if z is in S, then z * (1+i) and (z-1) * (1+i) + 1 are in S (where i denotes the imaginary unit), and duplicates are deleted as they occur; a(n) = the real part of the n-th term of S.
%C A290884 See A290885 for the imaginary part of the n-th term of S.
%C A290884 See A290886 for the square of the norm of the n-th term of S.
%C A290884 This sequence is a variant of A290536.
%C A290884 The representation of the first terms of S in the complex plane has nice fractal features, and looks like a Dragon curve (see also Links section).
%C A290884 The building of this sequence is close to that of the Twindragon (see Wikipedia link).
%C A290884 The sequence S' built with the same rules but with the initial term S'(1) = 1 seems to be the complement of S; the set of elements of S is the image of the set of elements of S' with respect to the symmetry z -> 1 - z.
%C A290884 From _Rémy Sigrist_, Jul 10 2018: (Start)
%C A290884 For any n >= 0 with binary expansion Sum_{k=0..h} b_k * 2^k, let g(n) = Sum_{k=0..h} b_k * (1+i)^k (where i denotes the imaginary unit).
%C A290884 Apparently, g(n) = i * a(n+1) - A290885(n+1) for any n >= 0.
%C A290884 The function g has similarities with the function f defined in A316657.
