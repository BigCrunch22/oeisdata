%N A290463 Consider decimal fractions r = abc/def with b != 0, d != 0 such that r = ac/df, sorted first by def and then by abc; sequence gives the denominators def.
%C A290463 These are "fractions with anomalous cancellation" of a particular type. Here the fractions are of the form abc/def, where the denominator has exactly three digits, such that if the tens digits (b and e) are canceled from the numerator and denominator the value is unchanged.
%C A290463 The numerator may have 2 or 3 digits.
%C A290463 For the numerators see A290462.
