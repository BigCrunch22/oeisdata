%N A290885 Let S be the sequence generated by these rules: 0 is in S, and if z is in S, then z * (1+i) and (z-1) * (1+i) + 1 are in S (where i denotes the imaginary unit), and duplicates are deleted as they occur; a(n) = the imaginary part of the n-th term of S.
%C A290885 See A290884 for the real part of the n-th term of S, and additional comments.
%C A290885 See A290886 for the square of the norm of the n-th term of S.
