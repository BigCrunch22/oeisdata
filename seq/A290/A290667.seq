%N A290667 Number of asymmetric equicolorable (unrooted) trees with 2*n vertices.
%C A290667 Any tree with 2n vertices is a bipartite graph with s vertices in one part and t vertices in the other part, where s <= t and s + t = 2n. We count trees with s = t = n, and which are asymmetric, that is, their only automorphism is the identity automorphism. These are also called identity trees.

%e A290667 a(3) = 0 because there are six trees with 6 vertices, but only three of these have s = t = n = 3, and none of these three is asymmetric. The fourth term a(4) = 1 because there are nine trees with 8 vertices with s = t = n = 4 but only 1 is asymmetric, namely tree T46. See "Atlas of Graphs", page 65.
