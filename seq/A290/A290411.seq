%N A290411 Maximum length of a run of consecutive positive integers that are either squarefree or divisible by the square of at least one of the first n primes.
%C A290411 The length of a run of consecutive squarefree positive integers is limited to 3 because no multiple of 4 is squarefree; thus, a(0) <= 3.
%C A290411 But suppose we consider runs of consecutive positive integers that are either squarefree or divisible by 4. No such set of 18 numbers can exist, since it would include two multiples of 3^2 = 9, at most one of which would be divisible by 4, so a(1) <= 17.
%C A290411 No set of 75 consecutive positive integers can have every member squarefree or divisible by 4 or 9, since any such set would include three multiples of 5^2 = 25, at most two of which would be divisible by 4 or 9, so a(2) <= 74.
%C A290411 By a similar argument, a(3) <= 4*7^2 - 1 = 195.
%C A290411 However, it does not follow in general that a(n) <= (n+1)*prime(n+1)^2 - 1; e.g., a(4) = 675 > 605 = 5*11^2, and the five multiples of 121 in the interval [2070582452238, 2070582452912], i.e., 121*{17112251672..17112251676}, are also divisible by 4, 9, 49, 25, and 4, respectively.
%C A290411 For n = 0..4, the smallest positive k that begins a run of a(n) consecutive integers of which each is squarefree or divisible by the square of at least one of the first n primes is 1, 28, 28976, 64779, and 2070582452238, respectively.
%e A290411 1, 2, and 3 are all squarefree, and no four consecutive positive integers can be squarefree, so a(0) = 3.
%e A290411 Each of the 17 integers in {28, ..., 44} is either squarefree or divisible by 2^2 = 4, and no interval of more than 17 consecutive positive integers has this property, so a(1) = 17.
%e A290411 Each of the 74 consecutive positive integers in {28976, ..., 29049} is squarefree or divisible by 4 or 9, and no larger set has this property, so a(2) = 74.
