%N A290649 The largest number z less than or equal to 3n+1 such that binomial(z,n) is odd.
%C A290649 This sequence is related to and derived from a problem in algebraic topology which asks you to find the largest a+b such that (x+z)^a * (y+z)^b is nonzero mod 2 when x^{n+1}=y^{n+1}=z^{n+1}=0. See the paper at the url below for more information.

%F A290649 If n=2^e + d with 0<= d < 2^e, then a(n)=min(3* 2^e + a(d), 2^{e+2}-1). I can prove this, and also the following explicit formula. If n=A+B, where A==0 mod 2^{e+2}, and 2^e + 2^{e-1} <= B < 2^{e+1}, then a(n)=3A + 2^{e+2}-1. (This is saying that the highest adjacent 1's in the binary expansion of n are in positions e and e-1. If there are none, then a(n)=3n+1 if n is even, and 3n if n is odd.)
