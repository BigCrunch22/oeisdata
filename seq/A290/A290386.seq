%N A290386 Increasing sequence a(n)>a(n-1) where a(n)=smallest integer not yet in the sequence with no digits shared with the previous term a(n-1), no repeated digits, and no 0-digit allowed.
%C A290386 The fact that the sequence is increasing makes it finite.
%e A290386 12 follows 9 since 10 has the digit 0 and 11 has a repeated digit.
%e A290386 34 follows 12 since any number in between either shares a digit with 12, has a 0 (30), or a repeated digit (33).
