%N A290187 Minimum number of moves to rearrange a Tower of Hanoi puzzle with 3 colors. There are 3 rods with n discs in descending sizes. On the first rod there are n red discs, on the 2nd n blue discs and on the 3rd n white ones.
%C A290187 Like the known Tower of Hanoi you have 3 rods with n discs in descending sizes. But here on the first rod there are n red discs, on the 2nd n blue discs and on the 3rd n white ones.
%C A290187 The task is to rearrange the discs so that red ones go to rod 2, the blue ones to rod 3 and the white ones to rod 1. Sequence lists the number of minimum moves needed to rearrange the discs.
%C A290187 I have written a program to find the minimum moves, it might be improved for higher values.

%e A290187 For n=1 the moves are 23-12-32-31-23 (meaning to move a disc from rod 2 to 3, then 1 to 2, ...).
%e A290187 For n=2 the moves are 31-21-23-13-13-13-12-31-31-31-32-12-12-12-31-21-21-21-23-13-13-12-31.
