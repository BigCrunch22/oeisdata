%N A290541 Record gaps between numbers that are either prime or twice a prime.
%C A290541 Records in A290496.
%C A290541 The gap of 57 between 31397 and 31454 is due to the record prime gap between 31397 and 31469 being almost exactly twice the record prime gap between 15683 and 15727.
%F A290541 a(n) = A290489(n) - A290488(n).
%e A290541 a(3) = 6 because the next number that is a prime or twice a prime after 47 is 53, and that is a record gap of size 6.
