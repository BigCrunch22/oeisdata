%N A290183 a(n) is least p to label a node of height n in the rooted tree which has the primes (A000040) as labels for its nonroot nodes, and the parent of the node labeled p is the node labeled with the greatest prime less than p/2 (or the root if there is no such node).
%C A290183 The parent of the node labeled p is the adjacent node through which it is connected to the root.
%C A290183 The "tree of primes" defined above relates to many older sequences. The node labeled A055377(n) is parent of the node labeled n. The node labeled prime(k) has A102820(k) child nodes and unless it has no child nodes, these are labeled with the primes from A059786(k) to A059788(k+1). The leaf node labels are A080192. The nodes of depth m are those with labels in the interval [A055496(m), A055496(m+1)). The full tree may be defined using A000040 read as a table with row lengths given by A102820 prefixed by 2.
%C A290183 If the set of heights of nodes has a greatest finite value, k, this sequence is finite with k+1 contiguous defined terms.
%C A290183 That said, the author's initial assessment is that occurrence of height n nodes will have similarities to occurrence of least primes of prime k-tuples, namely: (1) labels of nodes of height n will occur almost as though at random intervals amongst the primes; (2) for any n, the apparent odds against a prime p being such a label will not be greater than polynomial in log(p); and thus (3) a(n) plausibly exists for all n.
%C A290183 Some initial empirical observation suggests nodes of height n+1 may occur something like 5 to 10 times less frequently than those of height n.
%C A290183 Terms a(1) to a(5) come from the subtree consisting of the node labeled 17 and its descendants, as depicted in the example section below. This implies 4 consecutive negative first differences, which may be rare later in the sequence.

%F A290183 a(n) = min (A055377^(n+1) \ A055377^(n+2)), where A055377^(i) denotes the image set of N after i applications of A055377. - clarified following suggestion by _Michel Marcus_, Nov 13 2018
%e A290183 The only prime between 2 * 331 = 662 and 2 * nextprime(331) = 2 * 337 = 674 is 673, so the node labeled 331 is parent only to the node labeled 673. There are no primes between 2 * 673 = 1346 and 2 * nextprime(673) = 2 * 677 = 1354, so the node labeled 673 is a leaf. Thus the node labeled 331 has height 1. It is the least such prime, so a(1) = 331.
