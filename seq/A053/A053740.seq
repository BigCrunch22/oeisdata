%N A053740 Number of prime triangle partitions of order n.
%C A053740 A triangle partition is prime if it does not contain a triangle partition of lower order.
%C A053740 The order of a triangle partition is the number of smaller triangles into which the initial triangle is divided. The sequence counts only topologically distinct partitions. - _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 14 2024

%e A053740 From _M. F. Hasler_, Feb 14 2024: (Start)
%e A053740 a(2) = 1 because a triangle can be divided into two smaller triangles in only one way, up to topological equivalence, namely by a straight line going through one of the vertices and a point on the opposite side.
%e A053740 a(3) = 1 counts the dissection of a triangle ABC into three smaller ones by three segments AD, BD, CD, where D is a point inside ABC. There are three other topologically inequivalent partitions of order 3, each using two segments, as follows: {AE, AF}, {AE, EG} and {AE, BH}, where E and F are two distinct points on BC, G is a point on AB, and H is a point on AE. It is easy to see that these aren't prime since removing the smaller triangle that has side AC leaves a triangle partition of order 2. (End)
