%N A053624 Highly composite odd numbers: odd numbers where d(n) increases to a record.
%C A053624 Also numbers k such that the number of partitions of k into consecutive integers is a record. For example, 45 = 22+23 = 14+15+16 = 7+8+9+10+11 = 5+6+7+8+9+10 = 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9, six such partitions, but all smaller terms have fewer such partitions (15 has four). See A000005 comments and A038547 formula. - _Rick L. Shepherd_, Apr 20 2008

%C A053624 A140864 is a subsequence. (End)
%C A053624 Positions of records in A001227, i.e., integers whose number of odd divisors sets a new record. - _Bernard Schott_, Jul 18 2022
%C A053624 Conjecture: all terms after the first three terms are congruent to 5 mod 10. - _Harvey P. Dale_, Jul 05 2023
%C A053624 From _Keith F. Lynch_, Jan 12 2024: (Start)
%C A053624 Dale's conjecture is correct.  a(n) can't be even, since then a(n)/2 would be a smaller number with the same number of odd divisors.  The respective powers of the successive odd primes can't increase, since if they did, swapping them would give a smaller number with the same number of divisors, e.g., 3^2 * 5^4 has the same number of divisors as 3^4 * 5^2, and the latter is smaller.  As such, every a(n) must be an odd multiple of 5, hence congruent to 5 mod 10, unless it's simply a power of 3.  But multiplying a power of 3 by 3 gives just one more divisor while multiplying a power of 3 by 5 doubles the number of divisors, so after a(n) = 9 all a(n) must be congruent to 5 mod 10, i.e., have a rightmost decimal digit of 5.
%C A053624 This has three equivalent definitions:
%C A053624 * Odd numbers with more divisors than any smaller odd number.
%C A053624 * Numbers with more odd divisors than any smaller number, i.e., record high values of A001227.
%C A053624 * Numbers with a greater excess of odd divisors over even divisors than any smaller number, i.e., record high values of A048272. (End)
