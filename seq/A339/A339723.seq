%N A339723 Start with a(1)=1. Thereafter, to get a(n), write a(n-1) in binary, write down all its run lengths, and concatenate them in binary, getting k. Then a(n) = k unless k is already in the sequence, in which case a(n) = smallest missing number.

%e A339723 for n=3, a(2) = 2 in binary is 10 with run length 1,1, concatenated is 11 which in base 10 is k=3. So a(3)=3.
%e A339723 For n=7 doing this gives 7 which is already in the sequence (at n=5) so we put 6 as it is the smallest number not already in the sequence.
%Y A339723 Cf. A175930 (concatenated run lengths).
