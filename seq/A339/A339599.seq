%N A339599 Quadratically perfect numbers: numbers k such that (sigma(k) - 2k)^2 = sigma(k).
%C A339599 Paul Lescot observed that if m is a perfect number and 2m - 1 is prime, then m * (2m - 1) belongs to this sequence.
%C A339599 Moreover, Lescot proved that an even integer k belongs to this sequences if and only if k = m * (2m - 1) for an even perfect number m = 2^(p-1) * (2^p - 1) and 2m - 1 is prime. Among all primes p in A000043 (Mersenne exponents) up to 23209, only p = 2 and 5, which give 66 and 491536 respectively, satisfy this condition.
%C A339599 An even term k in this sequence belongs to A256151 since k = m * (2m - 1) and sigma(k) is square.
%C A339599 Lescot also confirms that there exists no odd integer between 5 and 10^6 in this sequence and conjectures that there exists no further odd term in this sequence.
%C A339599 There exists no further term in this sequence in n <= 2^32.
%C A339599 Question: are there only four terms in this sequence?
