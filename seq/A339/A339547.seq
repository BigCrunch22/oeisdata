%e A339547 a(10) = 15: this is the number of non-reciprocal resistance values provided in Karnofsky's solution of the 10-resistors puzzle. The list of 15 resistances is: 95/106, 101/109, 98/103, 97/98, 103/101, 97/86, 110/91, 103/83, 130/101, 103/80, 115/89, 106/77, 109/77, 98/67, 101/67.
%e A339547 a(11) = 172: the corresponding resistances are provided in A338581/A338591.
%e A339547 a(12) = 1114: the corresponding resistances are provided in A338582/A338592.
