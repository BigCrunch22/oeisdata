%N A339460 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is the number of k-element equivalence classes of closed meanders with 2n points.
%C A339460 Two closed meanders s and t with 2n points are equivalent iff their corresponding permutations s(1) s(2) ... s(2n) and t(1) t(2) ... t(2n) have the same absolute difference sequence, i.e. |s(i+1) - s(i)| = |t(i+1) - t(i)| for all i = 1,2,..,2n, where s(1) = t(1) = s(2n+1) = t(2n+1) = 1.
