%N A339377 Number of triples (x, y, z) of natural numbers satisfying x+y = n and 2*x*y = z^2.
%C A339377 This sequence is inspired by the 4th problem proposed during the second day of the final round of the 18th Austrian Mathematical Olympiad in 1987. The problem asked to find all triples solutions (x, y, z) only for n = 1987 (see Link, Reference and last example).
%C A339377 Some properties:
%C A339377 -> Inequalities, 0 <= x, y <= n; 0 <= z <= floor(n*sqrt(2)/2)
%C A339377 -> z is even and (x,y) are not together even.
%C A339377 -> a(n) = 1 iff n = 0, and the only solution is (0,0,0).
%C A339377 -> for n >= 1, a(n) >= 2 because (0,n,0) and (n,0,0) are always solutions.
%C A339377 -> a(n) is even for n >= 1.
%C A339377 -> If n = 3k, then (k,2k,2k) and (2k,k,2k) are solutions.
%C A339377 -> If 2*(n-1) = m^2, then (1,n-1,m) and (n-1,1,m) are solutions (with n in A058331).
%C A339377 -> The formula for n>0 comes from (x+y=n and 2*x*y=z^2) <==> n^2 = |x-y|^2 + 2*z^2.

%F A339377 a(0)=A218799(0); then for n>=1, a(n)=2*A218799(n) (remark from _Hugo Pfoertner_, Dec 02 2020).
%e A339377 a(9) = 6 and these 6 solutions are: (0, 9, 0), (1, 8, 4), (3, 6, 6), (6, 3, 6), (8, 1, 4), (9, 0, 0).
%e A339377 a(1987) = 4 and these 4 solutions are: (0, 1987, 0), (529, 1458, 1242), (1458, 529, 1242), (1987, 0, 0); this is the answer to the Olympiad problem in link.
