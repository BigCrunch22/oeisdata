%N A339670 a(1) = 2, a(2) = 3; for n>2, a(n) = smallest number not already used that shares a prime factor with a(n-2) and has a prime factor not in a(n-1).
%C A339670 Inspired by A064413 and A336957. The terms show a similar pattern to A064413, and like that sequence they are likely a permutation of the positive integers.
%C A339670 See A339671 for a similar sequence where the prime factor rules are reversed.
%e A339670 a(4) = 4 as a(3) = 4 = 2*2 and a(2) = 2, thus a(4) must contain 2 as a prime factor but must also contain a prime factor other than 2. The lowest unused number matching these criteria is 2*3 = 6.
%e A339670 a(7) = 9 as a(6) = 10 = 2*5 and a(5) = 6 = 2*3, thus a(7) must contain 2 or 3 as a prime factor but must also contain a prime factor other than 2 and 5. The lowest unused number matching these criteria is 3*3 = 9.
