%N A339274 Number of times the n-th prime (=A000040(n)) occurs in A033933.
%C A339274 Each term in A033933 is either 1 or a prime number. Moreover it is known that each prime occurs only a finite number of times in A033933.
%C A339274 By excluding the terms that equal one from A033933, we observe the smallest value of A033933(n)/log(n!) in the range n = 3..2000 to be ~0.1552. From this it is believed that the primes less than 0.9*log(2001!)*0.1552 (~ 1846) will not occur anymore in the sequence A033933 for n > 2000; the applied factor 0.9 is a safety factor to be more or less sure that the prime numbers up to about 1846 will no longer occur in A033933.

%F A339274 It seems that Sum_{k = 1..n} a(k) ~ 0.7*A000040(n)/log(log(A000040(n))).
%e A339274 The prime number 13 occurs 2 times in A033933, and A000040(6) = 13, so a(6) = 2.
