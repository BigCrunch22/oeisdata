%N A339138 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct nonnegative terms such that the first digit d of a(n), for n > 1, is the sum of the two closest digits of d (they are the rightmost digit of a(n-1) and the next digit on the right of d).
%C A339138 The first two digits of a(n) cannot be in ascending order.
%p A339138 a(2) = 1 and 1 is the sum of 0 + 1 (closest digits to 1);
%p A339138 a(3) = 10 and 1 is the sum of 1 + 0 (closest digits to 1);
%p A339138 a(4) = 11 and the first 1 is the sum of 0 + 1 (closest digits to 1);
%p A339138 a(5) = 21 and 2 is the sum of 1 + 1 (closest digits to 2); etc.
%Y A339138 Cf. A339139 (where the last digit is involved, instead of the first digit).
