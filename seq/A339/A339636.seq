%N A339636 Counterexamples to a conjecture about integers representable as the quotient of two Cantor numbers (A005823).
%C A339636 Let C be the Cantor numbers (A005823), and let A be the set of integers congruent to 1 (mod 3) representable as the quotient of two nonzero elements of C (A339637). It is easy to see that if (3/2)*3^i < n < 2*3^i for some i, then n cannot be in A. Initial empirical data suggested that these are the only integers congruent to 1 (mod 3) not in A. However, there are "sporadic" counterexamples enumerated by this sequence entry, whose structure is not well understood.
%C A339636 A simple automaton-based (or breadth-first search) algorithm can establish in O(n) time whether n is in A or not.
%C A339636 Conjecture: every number of the form 23*3^(4k+3) - 20 is not representable. In addition to numbers already in the sequence, for k = 3 this gives 330024841, which is also not representable.
