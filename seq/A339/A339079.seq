%N A339079 a(n) is the least number which is coprime to its binary weight (A094387) with a gap n to the next term of A094387, or 0 if such a number does not exist.
%C A339079 a(15) > 6 * 10^12, if it exists.
%e A339079 a(1) = 1 since both 1 and 2 = 1 + 1 are coprime to their binary weight, and they are the least pair of consecutive numbers with this property.
%e A339079 a(2) = 5 since 5 and 7 = 5 + 2 are coprime to their binary weight, and 6 is not since gcd(6, A000120(6)) = 2, and they are the least pair with a difference 2 with this property.
