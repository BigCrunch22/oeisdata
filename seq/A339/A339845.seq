%N A339845 Number of distinct sorted degree sequences among all n-vertex loop-graphs without isolated vertices.
%C A339845 In the covering case, these degree sequences, sorted in decreasing order, are the same thing as loop-graphical partitions (A339656). An integer partition is loop-graphical if it comprises the multiset of vertex-degrees of some graph with loops, where a loop is an edge with two equal vertices.
%C A339845 The following are equivalent characteristics for any positive integer n:
%C A339845 (1) the prime indices of n can be partitioned into distinct pairs, i.e. into a set of loops and edges;
%C A339845 (2) n can be factored into distinct semiprimes;
%C A339845 (3) the prime signature of n is loop-graphical.

%e A339845   {{2,2},{3,3},{1,2},{1,3}}
%e A339845 all have degrees y = (3,3,2), so y is counted under a(3).
