%N A339892 Maximum number of fundamentally different graceful labelings for a simple graph of n nodes without isolated vertices.
%C A339892 The difference between "fundamentally different graceful labelings" of a graph and "graceful labelings" of a graph is that the latter is the former multiplied by twice the number of automorphisms. (The extra factor of 2 comes from complementation.)

%e A339892 The other six graphs with four vertices are either ungraceful (2K_1) or uniquely graceful (K_1,3, K_4, C_4, P_4) or have fewer than 5 (K_1,1,2 has 4).
%e A339892 For n=5 the "dart" has a(5)=26 fundamentally different labelings.
