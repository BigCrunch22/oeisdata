%N A339024 a(1) = 1, a(n) is the least m not already in the sequence whose binary expansion begins with the binary expansion of the binary weight of a(n-1).
%C A339024 We define binary weight wt(n) = A000120(n) as the number of 1s in n_2, the number n expressed in binary. Let w = wt(a(n-1)) the binary weight of the previous term, where w_2 is w expressed in binary, and let interval I(j) = 2^j <= n <= (2^(j+1)-1).'
%C A339024 Likely a permutation of the natural numbers.
%C A339024 The plot (n, a(n)) is organized into streaky clouds that pertains to a "family" M(i) <= m < M(i+1) whose binary expansion begins with an odd "prefix" m/2^v, where v is the 2-adic valuation of m. There are thus 2^v numbers in this range.
%C A339024 The numbers in this range accommodate the binary weights wt(a(n-1)) = w with 1 <= w <= ceiling(log_2 a(n-1)) such that w_2 appears in part or all of the binary expansion of the prefix m/2^v, and perhaps an additional bit in m after the prefix.
%C A339024 Small values of w, for instance w = 1, may appear in any family, but large w require the entire prefix and potentially more (if even).
%C A339024 The w that cannot be found in a particular family are found in a different family that has M(i+1) as its least member.
%C A339024 The families M(i) belong in turn to classes according to odd prefixes. Thus, for example, we may find w = 1, 2, 4, and 9 in class 9, since "1", "10", "100", and "1001" can be found in numbers m that begin, "1001...".
%C A339024 For w in interval I(j), we have values 1 <= k <= j - 1 distributed binomially.
%C A339024 Permutation of the natural numbers. We can always find w in a number m in family M(i) that pertains to a class C of numbers that in binary start with the binary expansion of an odd number c.
%C A339024 Numbers m that begin with numbers that are formed of left-trimmed bits of c exhaust the numbers in M(i) before moving to M(i+1) in the same class C.
%C A339024 When we have recordsetting odd w, a new class C opens up based on the binary expansion of a larger odd number c.
%C A339024 A permutation of the integers since n appears at or before index 2^n - 1, the first number with binary weight n. - _Michael S. Branicky_, Dec 16 2020

%e A339024 Let wt(n) = A000120(n).
%e A339024 a(2) = 2 since wt(a(1)) = wt(1) = 1, and we find "1" at the beginning of the binary expansion of the yet unused 2 = "10"_2.
%e A339024 a(3) = 3 since wt(2) = 1, we find "1" as first bit of yet unused 3 = "11"_2.
%e A339024 a(4) = 4 since wt(3) = 2 = "10"_2, we find "10" as first bits of yet unused 4 = "100"_2.
%e A339024 a(5) = 5 since wt(4) = 1, and yet unused 5 = "101"_2 starts with 1.
%e A339024 a(6) = 8 since wt(5) = 2 = "10"_2; we see that the yet unused 6 and 7 start with "11"_2, and it isn't until 8 that we have a number that when expressed in binary starts with "10"_2.
%e A339024 a(7) = 6 since wt(8) = 1, we can now apply the yet unused 6 = "110"_2 because it starts with 1, etc.
