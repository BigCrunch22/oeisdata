%N A339843 Number of distinct sorted degree sequences among all n-vertex half-loop-graphs without isolated vertices.
%C A339843 In the covering case, these degree sequences, sorted in decreasing order, are the same thing as half-loop-graphical partitions (A321729). An integer partition is half-loop-graphical if it comprises the multiset of vertex-degrees of some graph with half-loops, where a half-loop is an edge with one vertex.
%C A339843 The following are equivalent characteristics for any positive integer n:
%C A339843 (1) the prime indices of n can be partitioned into distinct singletons or strict pairs, i.e., into a set of half-loops or edges;
%C A339843 (2) n can be factored into distinct primes or squarefree semiprimes;
%C A339843 (3) the prime signature of n is half-loop-graphical.

%e A339843 For example, the half-loop-graphs

%e A339843   {{1},{2},{3},{1,2},{1,3}}
%e A339843 both have degrees y = (3,2,2), so y is counted under a(3).
