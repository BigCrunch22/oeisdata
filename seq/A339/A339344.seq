%N A339344 Lexicographically earliest sequence of odd primes such that the asymptotic density of the numbers which are divisible by at least one of these primes is 1/2.
%C A339344 Given a set of prime numbers P, finite or infinite, the set of numbers which are divisible by at least one of the primes in P has an asymptotic density Product_{p in P} (1 - 1/p). If P is finite, then this density is equal to 1/2 only when P = {2}. Otherwise, the density is 1/2 for infinitely many sets P. This sequence is the lexicographically earliest infinite sequence of such primes.
%C A339344 The first 5 terms are the Fermat primes (A019434).
%C A339344 a(10) = 7.455916... * 10^135 is too large to be included in the data section.
