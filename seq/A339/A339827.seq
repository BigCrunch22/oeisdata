%N A339827 a(n) = least k such that the first n-block in A339824 occurs in A339825 beginning at the k-th term.
%e A339827 The sequence begins with one 3, two 4's, six 8's, six 12's, ...  Conjecture: the sequence includes infinitely many distinct numbers, in which case, every finite block in A339824 occurs infinitely many times in A339825.
%e A339827 Let W denote the infinite Fibonacci word A003849.
%e A339827 A339824 = even bisection of W:  001100110001000100011...
%e A339827 A339825 =  odd bisection of W:  100010001100110011000...
%e A339827 Using offset 1 for A339824, block #1 of A339825 is 1, which first occurs in A339824 beginning at the 3rd term, so a(1) = 3;
%e A339827 block #4 of A339824 is 0011, which first occurs in A339824 beginning at the 8th term, so a(4) = 8.
