%N A339161 Decimal expansion of least positive x such that Gamma(-x) = x^2.
%C A339161 Motivated by a question about solutions to (x-1)! = x^2 in a mathematical discussion group. As can be seen from growth of the respective functions, the only solution in the positive integers is x = 1; (5-1)! ~ 5^2 is a near miss.
%C A339161 If (x-1)! is replaced by the Gamma function Gamma(x), then in addition to the positive non-integer solution x = 5.0367... (see A264785) there are non-integer solutions increasingly close to each negative integer: x = -1.5259... is the largest one (also the farthest from an integer), then come -1.806544..., -3.017901..., -3.997382..., -5.000333... etc. They are to the left of odd and to the right of even negative integers, and the reciprocals of the distances 1/(x[n]+n), rounded to nearest integers, go: -2, 5, -56, 382, -3002, ... (see A339167).
