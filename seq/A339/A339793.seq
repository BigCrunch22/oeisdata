%N A339793 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n > 2, a(n) is the smallest positive number not occurring earlier that is a multiple of s(a(n-1)), the sum of the proper divisors of a(n-1).
%C A339793 The sequence is possibly a permutation of the positive integers as when a(n-1) is prime a(n) will be the next smallest number that has not previously occurred. However this will depend on the likelihood of a(n) being a prime as n goes to infinity. For the first 478 terms the last prime is a(144) = 59, while a(478) = 19140499834691254267668, indicating prime values become increasingly rare, and could potentially have a finite number as n->infinity.
%C A339793 The sum of the proper divisors of n is given by A001065(n).
