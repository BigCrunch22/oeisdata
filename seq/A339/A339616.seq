%N A339616 The Judd Trump's "infinite plant" sequence: prime numbers become nonprime numbers by striking the cue ball 2 with a cue stick to the right (see the Comments section).
%C A339616 There is a non-snooker description of this sequence: first erase all spaces between terms; then move every comma 1 position to the left; the new sequence is now made by nonprimes only (with duplicates, sometimes); the starting sequence (this one) is the lexicographically earliest with this property that has no duplicates and no nonprimes.
%e A339616 Striking 2 to the right pushes 2 against 11;
%e A339616 the last digit of 11 is then pushed against 3 (leaving 21 behind - a nonprime);
%e A339616 the last digit of 3 is then pushed against 23 (leaving 1 behind - a nonprime);
%e A339616 the last digit of 23 is then pushed against 29 (leaving 32 behind - a nonprime);
%e A339616 the last digit of 29 is then pushed against 5 (leaving 32 behind - a nonprime);
%e A339616 the last digit of 5 is then pushed against 13 (leaving 9 behind - a nonprime);
%e A339616 etc.
%e A339616 This is the lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms with this property.
