%N A339806 Indices of vertex points of the upper convex hull of the squarefree number graph.
%C A339806 Denoting the number of squarefrees up to n by Q(n), we say (n, Q(n)) is on the upper convex hull of the squarefree number graph if for all integers m_1 < n and all integers m_2 > n, (n, Q(n)) is above the secant line from (m_1, Q(m_1)) to (m_2, Q(m_2)). To determine whether n is the index of a vertex in the upper convex hull, it suffices to only check the record maximum points of Q(m)-6*m/Pi^2.
%e A339806 3 is on the upper convex hull because Q(3) = 3 and the secant line from (1,1) or (2,2) to (n,Q(n)) for any n>3 passes below the point (3,Q(3)).
%Y A339806 Cf. A275390 (record values of |Q(m)-6*m/Pi^2|).
