%N A339959 Number of times the n-th prime (=A000040(n)) occurs in A033932.
%C A339959 Each term in A033932 is either 1 or a prime number. Moreover, it is known that each prime occurs only a finite number of times in A033932.
%C A339959 By excluding the terms that equal one from A033932, we observe the smallest value of A033933(n)/log(n!) in the range n = 2..4000 to be ~0.1399. From this it is believed that the primes less than 0.9*log(4001!)*0.1399 (~ 3676) will not occur anymore in the sequence A033932 for n > 4000; the applied factor 0.9 is a safety factor to be more or less sure that the prime numbers up to about 3676 will no longer occur in A033932 for n > 4000.

%F A339959 It seems that Sum_{k = 1..n} a(k) ~ 0.7*A000040(n)/log(log(A000040(n))).
%e A339959 The prime number 11 occurs 2 times in A033932, and A000040(5) = 11, so a(5) = 2.
