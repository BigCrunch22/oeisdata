%N A339671 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2; for n>2, a(n) = smallest number not already used that shares a prime factor with a(n-1) and has a prime factor not in a(n-2).
%C A339671 Inspired by A064413 and A336957. The terms show a similar pattern to A064413, and like that sequence they are likely a permutation of the positive integers. Many terms also match the values in A169837. For example a(17)=20 to a(115)=111 (shifted by an index of 1) are the same, but then differ again before more matches occurr.
%C A339671 See A339670 for a similar sequence where the prime factor rules are reversed.
%e A339671 a(4) = 6 as a(3) = 4 = 2*2 and a(2) = 2, thus a(4) must contain 2 as a prime factor but must also contain a prime factor other than 2. The lowest unused number matching these criteria is 2*3 = 6.
%e A339671 a(6) = 15 as a(5) = 3 and a(4) = 6 = 2*3, thus a(6) must contain 3 as a prime factor but must also contain a prime factor other than 2 and 3. The lowest unused number matching these criteria is 3*5 = 15. This is the first term that differs from A064413.
