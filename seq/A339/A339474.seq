%N A339474 Numbers at the start of a run of 2 or more consecutive primes that are Sophie Germain primes.
%C A339474 This sequence is similar to A128825, but also includes 2, and omits numbers like 20759 (see Example), which is a Sophie Germain prime in the interior of a run of more than two consecutive primes that are Sophie Germain primes.

%e A339474 2 is a Sophie Germain prime (since 2*2 + 1 = 5 is prime), 3 is a Sophie Germain prime (since 2*3 + 1 = 7 is prime), and 2 and 3 are consecutive primes, so 2 is a term of the sequence.
%e A339474 23 and 29 are consecutive primes, and both 23*2 + 1 = 47 and 29*2 + 1 = 59 are primes, so 23 is a term.
%e A339474 The three consecutive primes 20753, 20759, and 20771 are all Sophie Germain primes, and the primes immediately before 20753 and immediately after 20771 are not Sophie Germain primes, so {20753, 20759, 20771} forms a run of three consecutive primes that are Sophie Germain primes; 20753 is at the start of the run, so it is a term, but 20759 is not at the start of the run, so it is not a term.
