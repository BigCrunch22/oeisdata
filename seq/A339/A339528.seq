%N A339528 The number of n-faced polyhedra formed when an elongated dodecahedron is internally cut by all the planes defined by any three of its vertices.
%C A339528 For an elongated dodecahedron create all possible internal planes defined by connecting any three of its vertices. Use all the resulting planes to cut the polyhedron into individual smaller polyhedra. The sequence lists the number of resulting n-faced polyhedra, where 4 <= n <= 13.

%e A339528 The elongated dodecahedron has 18 vertices, 28 edges and 12 faces (8 rhombi and 4 hexagons). It is cut by 268 internal planes defined by any three of its vertices, resulting in the creation of 497096 polyhedra. No polyhedra with 12 faces or 14 or more faces are created.
