%N A339933 Number of partitions of n into two parts with the same sum of divisors.
%H A339933 <a href="/index/Par#part">Index entries for sequences related to partitions</a>
%F A339933 a(n) = Sum_{k=1..floor(n/2)} [sigma(k) = sigma(n-k)], where [ ] is the Iverson bracket and sigma(n) is the sum of divisors of n (A000203).
%e A339933 a(38) = 2; There are two partitions of 38 into two parts with the same sum of divisors, (23,15) and (19,19), since 1+23 = 24 = 1+3+5+15 and 1+19 = 20 = 1+19.
%t A339933 Table[Sum[KroneckerDelta[DivisorSigma[1, i], DivisorSigma[1, n - i]], {i, Floor[n/2]}], {n, 100}]
