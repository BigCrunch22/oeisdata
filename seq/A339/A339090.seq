%N A339090 GCD of friendly pairs.
%C A339090 The first 10000 friendly pairs (copied from the b-files of A050972 and A050973) all have either 2 or 3 (or both) as a common divisor and hence their GCD is divisible by 2 or 3. However this does not hold for all friendly pairs. GCD(3472, 544635) = 7. These two numbers belong to the club where sigma(x)/x = 16/7 (also 42 belongs to this club).
%F A339090 a(n) = gcd(A050972(n), A050973(n)).
%e A339090 The first friendly pair is (6, 28) and therefore a(1) = gcd(6, 28) = 2.
%Y A339090 Cf. A050972, A050973.
