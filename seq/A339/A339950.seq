%N A339950 Numbers k such that all k-sections of the infinite Fibonacci word A014675 have just two different run-lengths.
%C A339950 Equivalent definition: these are the numbers n such that all n-sections of the infinite Fibonacci word A003849 have just two run-lengths.
%C A339950 The distinct terms of the difference sequence of the first 40 terms are 6, 7, and 8.
%C A339950 Conjecture: a(n) = A189378(n-1)+1 for n >= 2. - _Don Reble_, Apr 06 2021.
%C A339950 "All n-sections" means all subsequences S(k) = (A014675(n*i+k); i = 0, 1, 2, ...), for k = 0, ..., n-1. "Run-lengths" means the numbers of consecutive equal terms in the sequence: see examples. - _M. F. Hasler_, Apr 07 2021

%e A339950 Let W = A014675, so that as a word, W = 21221212212212122121221221212212212122121221221...
%e A339950 The unique 1-section of W is W itself, which is a concatenation of runs 1, 2, and 22, so that a(1) = 2. The sequence A339949 shows that a(n) > 2 for n = 2,3,4,5,6. For n = 7, the n-section of W that starts with its first letter, 2, is 221221221221221221221221221221221221121..., in which the runs are 22, 1, 11, supporting the conjecture that a(2) = 7.
%e A339950 Some run-lengths may appear quite late. For example, when n = 68, the third run-length appears in the n-section S(k=0) only with the 2829th element, corresponding to the 192372-th element of the original sequence. - _M. F. Hasler_, Apr 07 2021
