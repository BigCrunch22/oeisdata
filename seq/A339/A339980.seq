%N A339980 Coreful Zumkeller numbers (A339979) whose set of coreful divisors can be partitioned into two disjoint sets of equal sum in a single way.
%C A339980 A coreful divisor d of a number k is a divisor with the same set of distinct prime factors as k, or rad(d) = rad(k), where rad(k) is the largest squarefree divisor of k (A007947).
%C A339980 The coreful perfect numbers (A307958) are a subsequence.
%e A339980 36 is a term since there is only one partition of its set of coreful divisors, {6, 12, 18, 36}, into 2 disjoint sets whose sums are equal: 6 + 12 + 18 = 36.
