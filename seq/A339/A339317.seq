%N A339317 Lexicographically earliest sequence of distinct positive terms such that a(n) is preceded by the a(n)-th digit of the sequence, for n > 1.
%C A339317 This sequence is a permutation of the numbers > 0.

%e A339317 a(1) = 1
%e A339317 a(2) = 3 is preceded by the 3rd digit of the sequence (this is the 1 of 10);
%e A339317 a(3) = 10 is preceded by the 10th digit of the sequence (this is the 3 of 30);
%e A339317 a(4) = 4 is preceded by the 4th digit of the sequence (this is the 0 of 10);
%e A339317 a(5) = 5 is preceded by the 5th digit of the sequence (this is the 4 of 4);
%e A339317 ...
%e A339317 a(9) = 30 because this is the smallest integer not leading to a contradiction [it must start with a 3 because of a(3) fixing the 10th digit of the sequence];  etc.
%Y A339317 Cf. A339206 (a variant of this sequence).
