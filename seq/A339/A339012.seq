%N A339012 Written in factorial base, n ends in a(n) consecutive non-0 digits.
%C A339012 Also, a(n) is the least p for which n mod (p+2)! < (p+1)!.  A small remainder like this means a 0 digit at position p in the factorial base representation of n, where the least significant digit is position p=0.  The least such p means only nonzero digits below.
%C A339012 Those n with a(n)=p are characterized by remainders n mod (p+2)!, per the formula below.  These remainders are terms of A227157 which is factorial base digits all nonzero.  A227157 can be taken by rows where row p lists the terms having p digits in factorial base.  Each digit ranges from 1 up to 1,2,3,... respectively so there are p! values in a row, and so the asymptotic density of terms p here is p!/(p+2)! = 1/((p+2)*(p+1)) = 1/A002378(p+1) = 1/2, 1/6, etc.
%C A339012 The smallest n with a(n)=p is the factorial base repunit n = 11..11 with p 1's = A007489(p).

%F A339012 a(n)=p iff n mod (p+2)! is a term in row p of A227157 (row p terms having p digits), including p=0 by reckoning an initial A227157(0) = 0 as no digits.
%F A339012 a(n)=0 iff n mod 2 = 0.
%F A339012 a(n)=1 iff n mod 6 = 1, which is A016921.
%F A339012 a(n)=2 iff n mod 24 = 3 or 5.
%e A339012 n = 10571 written in factorial base is 2,0,4,0,1,2,1.  It ends in 3 consecutive nonzero digits (1,2,1) so a(10571) = 3.  Remainder 10571 mod (3+2)! = 11 is in A227157 row 3.
