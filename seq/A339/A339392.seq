%N A339392 Numerators of the probability that when a stick is broken up at n-1 points independently and uniformly chosen at random along its length there exist 3 of the n pieces that can form a triangle.
%C A339392 For the corresponding probability that any triple of pieces can form a triangle, see A001791. The probabilities for these two cases were found by Kong et al. (2013).

%e A339392 For n = 1 or 2 the number of pieces is less than 3, so the probability is 0.
%e A339392 For n = 3, the stick is being broken into 3 pieces and the probability that they can form a triangle is 1/4, the solution to the classical broken stick problem (see, e.g., Gardner, 2001).
