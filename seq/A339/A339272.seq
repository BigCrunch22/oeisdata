%N A339272 a(n) is the smallest number k that can be partitioned into a set of n positive integers {e(1), e(2), ..., e(n)} where Sum_{i=1..n} e(i)*(e(i)-1) = k*(k-1)/2.
%C A339272 These numbers solve the problem of what is the required minimum number of socks of n colors such that a random drawing of two socks has a 50% chance of matching. In this version there may be a color with only one sock, and the number of socks of each color need not be distinct.
%C A339272 If the set solving a(n)=k has three 2's, then a(n+1)<=k, replacing them with one 3 and three 1's; this leads to many repeats in the data. Similar substitutions include {4, 5} for {1, 2, 6}, {3, 3, 4} for {1, 2, 2, 5}, and {3, 3} for {1, 1, 4}. - _Dean D. Ballard_ and _Michael S. Branicky_, Nov 30 2020
%e A339272 For n = 4, {1, 2, 2, 12} is the set with the smallest sum that has this property. With 1 sock of one color, 2 socks of a second color, 2 socks of a third color, and 12 socks of a fourth color, there is exactly a 50% chance that a random draw of two socks will produce a matching pair. (1*0 + 2*1 + 2*1 + 12*11) = (17*16) / 2.
