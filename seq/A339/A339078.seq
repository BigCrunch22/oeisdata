%N A339078 a(n) is the least number which is coprime to its digital sum (A339076) with a gap n to the next term of A339076, or 0 if such a number does not exist.
%C A339078 Cooper and Kennedy (1997) proved that there exist arbitrarily long gaps between consecutive numbers that are coprime to their digital sum.
%C A339078 a(22) > 6.7 * 10^12, if it exists, a(23) = 1500524609387, a(24) = 5222961488687.
%C A339078 a(30) <= 66166892131839499000000017947066278894975530188 (Cooper and Kennedy, 1997).

%e A339078 a(1) = 10 since both 10 and 11 = 10 + 1 are coprime to their digital sum, and they are the least pair of consecutive numbers with this property.
%e A339078 a(2) = 11 since 11 and 13 = 11 + 2 are coprime to their digital sum, 12 is not since gcd(12, 1+2) = 3, and they are the least pair with a difference 2 with this property.
