%N A339494 T(n, k) is the number of domino towers of n bricks with height at most 3 and k bricks in the base floor. Triangle read by rows, T(n, k) for 1 <= k <= n.
%C A339494 This is the third triangle in a sequence of triangles: The first is the unit triangle A023531; the second is the binomial triangle C(k, n-k) without the first column, triangle A030528. This triangle highlights the connection between the Pascal triangle and the Fibonacci numbers in the case m = 2. Similarly, the current triangle and its row sums generalizes this to the case m = 3 of the construction of Union(A333650(n, j), j=1..m), classified by the number of bricks in the base floor.
