%N A339546 Number of at least 3-connected planar triangulations on n vertices such that the minimum valence of any vertex in the mesh is maximized and the number of vertices with this minimum valence is minimized.
%C A339546 It is conjectured that for a polyhedron with maximum possible volume inscribed in a sphere the stated condition is necessary. All known polyhedra with conjecturally maximum volume satisfy this condition. For n <= 15 the given condition determines a unique mesh topology for each n, which coincides with the proved optimal solutions for n <= 8.
