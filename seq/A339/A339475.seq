%N A339475 Numbers at the start of a run of exactly 2 consecutive primes that are Sophie Germain primes.
%C A339475 Similar to A339474, but does not include numbers at the start of a run of 3 or more consecutive primes that are Sophie Germain primes.

%e A339475 23 is a term: 23 and 29 are consecutive primes, each is a Sophie Germain prime, and neither the prime before 23 (19)nor the one after 29 (31) is a Sophie Germain prime, so the length of the run is exactly 2.
%e A339475 2 is not a term: it is at the start of a run of 3 consecutive primes that are Sophie Germain primes, i.e., 2, 3, and 5.
%e A339475 Similarly, 20753 is not a term; it is at the start of a run of 3 consecutive primes that are Sophie Germain primes.
