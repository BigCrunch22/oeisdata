%N A339632 Number of partitions of 2n into two positive integer parts (s,t) such that s and t have the same number of decimal digits and s*t is semiprime.
%F A339632 a(n) = Sum_{k=1..n} [Omega(k*(2*n-k)) = 2] * [floor(log_10(k)) = floor(log_10(2*n-k))], where [ ] is the Iverson bracket and Omega is the number of prime factors of n with multiplicity (A001222).
%e A339632 a(18) = 0; 18 has 9 partitions into two positive integer parts, (17,1), (16,2), (15,3), (14,4), (13,5), (12,6), (11,7), (10,8), (9,9). There are no partitions whose parts have the same number of decimal digits and whose product is semiprime.
