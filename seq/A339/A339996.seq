%N A339996 Numbers whose square is rotationally ambigrammatic with no trailing zeros.
%C A339996 A rotationally ambigrammatic number (A045574) is one that can be rotated by 180 degrees resulting in a readable, most often new number. Such numbers, by definition, can only contain the digits 0, 1, 6, 8, 9.
%C A339996 If the number once rotated happens to be the same number it is a strobogrammatic number (A000787); such numbers form a subset of the ambigrammatic numbers.
%C A339996 Numbers (such as 10) whose square has trailing zeros have been excluded because the rotation of such a number by 180 degrees would result in a number with leading zeros. Typically this is not the way we write numbers.
%C A339996 The numbers 14 and 31 are interesting numbers in this sequence in that when their square is rotated 180 degrees, the square root results in the other number. I believe this is unique to only these two numbers.

%F A339996 a(n) = sqrt(A340164(n)).
%e A339996 13^2 = 169. A rotationally ambigrammatic number. Hence, 13 is a term.
%e A339996 15^2 = 225. Not rotationally ambigrammatic and hence 15 is not a term.
%e A339996 10^2 = 100. This number has trailing zeros, so under this definition of rotationally ambigrammatic, 10 is not a term.
