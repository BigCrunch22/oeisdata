%N A339250 List of dimensions for which there exist several non-isomorphic irreducible representations of E6.
%C A339250 Terms which would be repeated in A121737.
%C A339250 There are infinitely many terms in this sequence; see A181746.
%C A339250 By symmetry of the Dynkin diagram, with fundamental weights numbered as in Bourbaki there is a duality of highest weights [1,0,0,0,0,0] and [0,0,0,0,0,1]. Similarly, there is a duality of highest weights [0,0,0,0,1,0] and [0,0,1,0,0,0]. Note that E6 is the only exceptional Lie algebra with such a duality. However this duality is not responsible for all pairs of non-isomorphic irreducible E6 representations of equal dimension--see example.
%C A339250 There are 6 non-isomorphic irreducible E6 representations of dimension 7183313280, and 8 non-isomorphic irreducible E6 representations of dimension 7980534952482277785600. Both dimensions are minimal with respect to that property. I do not know if such dimensions exist for 9 or more irreducible representations.

%e A339250 With the fundamental weights numbered as in Bourbaki, the irreducible E6-modules with highest weights [1,0,0,0,0,0] and [0,0,0,0,0,1] both have dimension 77. The vectors [0,0,0,0,1,0], [0,0,1,0,0,0], [2,0,0,0,0,0], and [0,0,0,0,0,2] are the four highest weights which correspond to irreducible representations of dimension 351.
