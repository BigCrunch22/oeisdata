%N A339077 Numbers k such that k and k+1 are both coprime to their digital sum (A339076).
%C A339077 Cooper and Kennedy (1997) noted that this sequence is infinite since 10^k is a term for all k>=1. They also noted that there can be no more than 2 consecutive numbers that are coprime to their digital sum since if 3|k then 3|A007953(k).
