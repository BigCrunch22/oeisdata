%N A339468 The number of n-faced polyhedra formed when a truncated tetrahedron is internally cut by all the planes defined by any three of its vertices.
%C A339468 For a truncated tetrahedron create all possible internal planes defined by connecting any three of its vertices. Use all the resulting planes to cut the polyhedron into individual smaller polyhedra. The sequence lists the number of resulting n-faced polyhedra, where 4 <= n <= 12.

%e A339468 The truncated tetrahedron has 12 vertices, 18 edges and 4 faces (4 equilateral triangles and 4 hexagons). It is cut by 82 internal planes defined by any three of its vertices, resulting in the creation of 12999 polyhedra. No polyhedra with 10, 11, or 13 or more faces are created.
