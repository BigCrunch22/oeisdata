%N A226770 Let n+1 have proper divisors  1 < d_1,...,d_k < n+1; consider all proper divisors of n+d_1,...,n+d_k which did not appear earlier. Let them be d_{1,1}, d_{1,2},..., d_{k,1}, d_{k,2},..., d_{k,t}; then consider proper divisors of n+d_{1,1},...,n+d_{k,t} which did not appear earlier, repeat until no new divisor is introduced. a(n) is the total number of different divisors obtained.
%C A226770 a(n) = 0, iff n = p - 1, where p is prime; we conjecture that a(p) = p - 2 and, more general, for odd prime p and k>=1, a(p^k) = p^k - p^(k-1) - 1.
%C A226770 If n = p^2 - 1, where p^2 + p - 1 is prime (A053184), then a(n) = 1.
%C A226770 What one can say about other values of a(n)?

%e A226770 Let n=9; the proper divisors >1 of n + 1 are 2,5; consider n + 2 = 11 and n + 5 = 14. These numbers give only one "new" proper divisor (>1) 7;  the "new" proper divisors >1 of n + 7 = 16 are 4,8 and n + 4 = 13, n + 8 = 17 do not have proper divisors >1. The set of proper divisors of all considered sums is {2,5,7,4,8}. It contains 5 elements. Thus a(9) = 5.
