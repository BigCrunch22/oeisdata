%N A226142 The smallest positive integer k such that the symmetric group S_n is a product of k cyclic groups.
%C A226142 Since S_{n+1} is a product of a subgroup isomorphic to S_n and the cyclic group <(1,2,3,...,n+1)> we have a(n+1) <= a(n) + 1. On the other hand it is not clear that a(n) <= a(n+1) for all n. A lower bound is given by A226143(n) = ceiling(log(m)(n!)), m = A000793(n), a sequence that is not nondecreasing.
%C A226142 This sequence was suggested by a posting of _L. Edson Jeffery_ on the seqfans mailing list on May 24, 2013.
%C A226142 Cardinality of the smallest subset(s) X of S_n such that every permutation in S_n can be expressed as a product of some elements in X. - _Joerg Arndt_, Dec 13 2015

%e A226142 a(7) = 4 since a factorization of S_7 is given by C_1*C_2*C_3*C_4 where
%e A226142 C_1 = <(1,2,3,4)(5,6,7)>,
%e A226142 C_2 = <(1,4,6)(2,3,5,7)>,
%e A226142 C_3 = <(1,2,5,7)(3,4,6)>,
%e A226142 C_4 = <(1,3,5,6,7)(2,4)>,
%e A226142 and a brute force computation shows that S_7 is not a product of 3 or fewer cyclic subgroups.
