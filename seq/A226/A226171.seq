%N A226171 Smallest base in which n is not Niven (or zero if n is Niven in every base).
%C A226171 Niven numbers (in base b) are divisible by the sum of their digits (in base b).
%C A226171 Questions: are 1, 2, 4 and 6 the only zeros in this sequence? Where are the records or high water marks?
%C A226171 From _Bert Dobbelaere_, Oct 08 2018: (Start)
%C A226171 1,2,4,6 are the only numbers that are Niven in every base.
%C A226171 Proof: Suppose n is Niven in every base, then consider the base-b representations of n for (n/2) < b <= n. These are all 2-digit numbers with 1 as 1st digit and (n-b) as last digit. Then 1+n-b is a divisor of n for all b, meaning that all numbers between 1 up to n/2 are divisors of n. Clearly there are no such numbers larger than 6.
%C A226171 a(n) < 60 for n < 10^13.

%e A226171 The sum of digits of 24 in bases 1 through 14 are:  24, 2, 4, 3, 8, 4, 6, 3, 8, 6, 4, 2, 12, 11.  24 is divisible by all these numbers except the last one; therefore a(24) = 14.
