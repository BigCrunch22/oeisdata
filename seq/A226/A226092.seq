%N A226092 Fourth powers that become prime when their most significant (leftmost) decimal digit is removed.
%C A226092 This is to fourth powers A000583 as A226090 is to as cubes A000578, and as A225873 is to squares A000290.
%e A226092 a(1) = 7^4 = 2401, because removing the leftmost digit (4) leaves 401, which is prime.
%e A226092 a(2) = 23^4 = 279841, because removing the leftmost digit (2) leaves 79841, which is prime.
%e A226092 a(3) = 63^4 = 15752961, because removing the leftmost digit (1) leaves 5752961, which is prime.
%e A226092 a(10) = 119^4 = 200533921, because removing the leftmost digit (2) leaves 00533921 = 533921, which is prime.
