%N A226381 Numbers n such that the distance from n to the next prime is the same as the distance from n^2 to the next prime.
%C A226381 Numbers n such that (smallest prime > n)- n = (smallest prime > n^2)- n^2.
%C A226381 Primes in the sequence are: 2, 3, 7, 13, 31, 37, 61, 67, 97, 103, 131, 151, 163, 181, 193,...

%e A226381 1 is in the sequence because the distance from 1 to 2 is the same as the distance from 1^2 to 2.
%e A226381 2 is in the sequence because the distance from 2 to 3 is the same as the distance from 2^2 to 5.
%e A226381 3 is in the sequence because the distance from 3 to 5 is the same as the distance from 3^2 to 11.
