%N A226698 Central symmetric closed knight's tour on an 8x8 board, attributed to Euler. Position after n-th move.
%C A226698 a(n) is the position of the knight on the 8x8 board after the n-th move (a(0) gives the starting position) if one numerates the squares from left to right, top to bottom, from 1 to 64.
%C A226698 If the board is considered as an 8x8 matrix the square numbered N appears as element (n,m) = (floor((N-1)/8)+1, N - 8*floor((N-1)/8)), N = 1, ..., 64. Therefore, a(0) = 33, the knight's starting position is with N = 33: (5,1). The last position is with N = 27: (4,3).
%C A226698 a(n-1) is the inverse of A226697 read as a sequence: A226697(a(n-1)) = n, n=1, 2, ..., 64.
%C A226698 For the board see the example for A226697. Observe there the central symmetry with absolute difference constant 32.

%e A226698 a(1) = 50 because after the first move the knight is on the square N = 50, or considered as matrix position at square (7, 2). The path starts at square  a(0) = 33, or (5, 1). It ends after 63 moves on square a(63) = 27, or (4, 3). The next move can close the Hamiltonian path.
