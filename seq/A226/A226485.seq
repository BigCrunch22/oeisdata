%N A226485 Integer part of length of median to hypotenuse of primitive Pythagorean triangles sorted on hypotenuse.
%C A226485 The median to hypotenuse is equal to the circumradius.
%C A226485 The length of the median is sqrt((a^2)/2 + (b^2)/2 - (c^2)/4) where a,b,c are sides of the triangle. In case of Pythagorean triangles, m=h/2 were h is the hypotenuse.

%F A226485 a(n) = floor(A020882(n)/2).
%e A226485 a(1)=2 as it is the integer portion of the length of the median to hypotenuse of triangle having sides 3,4,5.
%e A226485 Similarly, a(5)=14 as it is the integer portion of the length of the median to hypotenuse of triangle having sides 20,21,29.
