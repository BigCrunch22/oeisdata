%N A226650 Numbers n such that the distance from 2^(2n) to the prev prime is the same as the distance from (2n)^2 to the prev prime.
%C A226650 Numbers n such that 2^(2n) - (largest prime < 2^(2n)) = (2n)^2 -(largest prime < (2n)^2).
%C A226650 Primes in the sequence are: 2, 5, 7,...
%e A226650 1 is in the sequence because the distance from 4 to 3 is the same as the distance from 4 to 3.
%e A226650 2 is in the sequence because the distance from 16 to 13 is the same as the distance from 16 to 13.
%e A226650 5 is in the sequence because the distance from 1024 to 1021 is the same as the distance from 100 to 97.
