%N A226224 The largest value of k in base n for which the sum of digits of k = sqrt(k).
%C A226224 There are no values of k in base n with more than 3 digits. Proof: such a value with d digits would need to meet the criterion d*(n-1)>=sqrt(n)^d which establishes an upper limit of 4 digits for 2<=n<=6 and 3 for n>6. Because there are no four digit values of k in bases 2 through 6, k has a maximum of three digits in all bases.
%C A226224 Because k must be a square, there are only sqrt(n)^3 possible values in any base.
%C A226224 From the above, it can be shown that for three-digit fixed points of the form xyz, x <= 6; also x<=4 for n>846. These theoretical upper limits are statistically unlikely, and in fact of the 86356 solutions in bases 2 to 10000, only 6.5% of them begin with 2, and none begin with 3 through 6.
%C A226224 a(n)=1 iff A226087(n)=1. Conjecture: this occurs exactly once -- in base 2.

%e A226224 For a(16) the solutions are the square numbers {1, 36=6^2, 100=10^2, 225=15^2, 441=21^2} because in base 16 they are written as {1, 24, 64, E1, 1B9} and 1 = 1, 6 = 2+4, 10 = 6+4, 15 = 14+1, and 21 = 1+11+9.
