%N A226665 Conjectured record-breaking maximal values, for ascending positive integers k, of the minimal elements of the primitive cycles of positive integers under iteration by the Collatz-like 3x+k function.
%C A226665 A cycle is called primitive if its elements are not a common multiple of the elements of another cycle.
%C A226665 The 3x+k function T_k is defined by T_k(x) = x/2 if x is even, (3x+k)/2 if x is odd, where k is odd.
%C A226665 For primitive cycles, GCD(k,6)=1.
%e A226665 a(1)=1 because {1,2}, with minimal element 1, is the only known '3x+1' cycle of positive integers.
%e A226665 k=5 is the next value of k>1 with GCD(k,6)=1. The minimal element in each of the five known primitive '3x+5' cycles of positive integers is 1, 19, 23, 187 and 347. 347>a(1) so a(2)=347.
%Y A226665 k = A226666(n).
