%N A226947 Number of runs of strictly increasing numbers of 2 X 2 squares in the list of partitions of an n X n square lattice into squares, considering only the list of parts, where partition sorting order is ascending with larger squares taking higher precedence.
%C A226947 The sequence was derived from the documents in the Links section.  The documents are first specified in the Links section of A034295.
%C A226947 a(n) = row length of A226948(n).

%e A226947 For n = 3, the partitions are:
%e A226947 Square side 1 2 3
%e A226947             9 0 0
%e A226947             5 1 0
%e A226947             0 0 1
%e A226947 So a(3) = 2 as there are 2 runs of 2 X 2 squares: (0,1) from the first 2 partitions and (0) from the third.
