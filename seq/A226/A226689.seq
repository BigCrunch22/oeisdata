%N A226689 Conjectured record-breaking numbers of odd elements, for ascending positive integers k, in primitive cycles of positive integers under iteration by the Collatz-like 3x-k function.
%C A226689 A cycle is called primitive if its elements are not a common multiple of the elements of another cycle.
%C A226689 The 3x-k function T_k is defined by T_k(x) = x/2 if x is even, (3x-k)/2 if x is odd.
%C A226689 For primitive cycles, GCD(k,6)=1.
%C A226689 For n<15, but probably not for all n, k = A226687(n) and the smallest integer in the T_k cycle associated with a(n) is A226688(n).
%Y A226689 Cf. A226626, A226673.
%K A226689 nonn
