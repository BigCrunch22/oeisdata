%N A010367 High-temperature spin-1/2 Ising model series for second derivative of susceptibility with respect to magnetic field for hyper-body-centered-cubic lattice.
%C A010367 Moore defines two four-dimensional lattices called hbcc ("hyper-body-centered-cubic") and hfcc. They have essentially the same arrangement of sites, up to a similarity transformation. (That set of sites forms the D_4 lattice.) However the sets of bonds are different: each site of hfcc is connected to all 24 of its nearest neighbors, while each site of hbcc is connected only to 16 of them, specifically those which have relative position vector (+-1, +-1, +-1, +-1), but not (+-2, 0, 0, 0) or its permutations. - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, Nov 26 2024
