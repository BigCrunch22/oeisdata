%N A010567 2n-step 3-dimensional closed paths on cubic lattice.
%C A010567 This sequence counts self-avoiding closed paths and agrees with A001413 except for n=1, for which the given value is "purely conventional" (although the convention is non-standard): it counts 6 two-step closed paths, all of which visit no node twice but use an edge twice, so whether they are "self-avoiding" is indeed a matter of agreement. Same considerations apply to the first terms of A010568-A010570. - _Andrey Zabolotskiy_, May 29 2018
