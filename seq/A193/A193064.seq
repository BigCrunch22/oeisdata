%N A193064 Primes p for which there is no prime q == 2 (mod 3) that is smaller than p and is a quadratic residue modulo p.
%C A193064 Gica proved that if p is a prime different from 2, 3, 5, 13, then a prime q < p exists which is a quadratic residue modulo p and q == 2 (mod 3). His paper has not yet been published, but see A192578 for a reference, link, and examples of a similar result.
