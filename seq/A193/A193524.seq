%N A193524 a(n)=Number of integer solutions of quartic elliptic curve y^2 = 5x^4 + 4n.
%C A193524 Quintic trinomial x^5-nx+m  is reducible into cubic and quadratic factors if and only a(n)<>0.
%C A193524 Particular case for n=1 x^5-x+m have 3 solutions for m<>0 see A179106. Rest two (5-3) giving m=0.
