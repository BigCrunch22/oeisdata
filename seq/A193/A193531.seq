%N A193531 Number of integer solutions to the quartic elliptic curve y^2 = 5*x^4 - 4*n.
%C A193531 The quintic x^5+n*x+m is reducible into cubic and quadratic factors if and only a(n) != 0.
%e A193531 We have following parametrization: (X^3 - d*X^2 + (d^2 - e)*X + (2*d*e - d^3))*(X^2 + d*X + e) =  -d^3*e + 2*d*e^2 + (-d^4 + 3*d^2*e - e^2)*X + X^5.
%e A193531 Solving the equation (-d^4 + 3*d^2*e - e^2) = n for e we have e=(3*d^2 +/-sqrt(5*d^4 - 4*n))/2. So 5*d^4 - 4*n must be a perfect square (then y^2=5*x^4-4*n has at least one integer solution).
