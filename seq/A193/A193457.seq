%N A193457 Paradigm shift sequence with procedure length p=5.
%C A193457 This sequence is the solution to the following problem: "Suppose you have the choice of using one of three production options: apply a simple action, bundle all existing actions (which requires p=5 steps), or apply the current bundled action. The first use of a novel bundle erases (or makes obsolete) all prior actions.  How many total actions (simple) can be applied in n time steps?"
%C A193457 1. This problem is structurally similar to the Copy and Paste Keyboard problem: Existing sequences (A178715 and A193286) should be regarded as Paradigm-Shift Sequences with Procedural Lengths p=1 and 2, respectively.
%C A193457 2. The optimal number of pastes per copy, as measured by the geometric growth rate (p+z root of z), is z = 6. [Non-integer maximum between 6 and 7.]
%C A193457 3. The function a(n) = maximum value of the product of the terms k_i, where Sum (k_i) = n+ 5 - 5*i_max
%C A193457 4. All solutions will be of the form a(n) = m^b * (m+1)^d

%F A193457 Recursive: for n>=80, a(n)=6*a(n-11)
%e A193457 For n=30, C=floor(38/11)=3, m=floor(35/3)-5 = 11-5 = 6, and R= (35 mod 3) = 2; therefore a(30) = 6^(3-2)*7^2 = 6*7^2 =294.
%e A193457 For n=13, use the general formula with C=2 (rather than C=1), with R = (18 mod 2) = 0, m=floor(18/2)-5=9-5=4; therefore a(13)=4^2*5^0=16.
%e A193457 For n=80, C = floor(88/11)=8, R=(88 mod 11) = 0, b = max(0,3)=3, and d=max(0,-3)=0; therefore a(80) = 5^3*6^(8-3)*7^0 = 5^3*6^5 = 972000
%Y A193457 A000792 (n>=1), A178715, A193286, A193455, A193456, and A193457 are paradigm shift sequences for p=0,1,...5 respectively.
