%N A079023 Let p and q be two prime numbers, not necessarily consecutive, such that q - p = 2n; then a(n) is the number of partitions of 2n into even numbers so that each partition corresponds to a consecutive prime difference pattern (k-tuple) and p <= A000230(n).
%C A079023 Partitions are counted with multiplicity and may overlap.
%e A079023 Only those partitions are counted that appear not later than prime A000230(n); n=7, d=14, A000230(7)=113; the number of solutions to p+14=q, with p and q both prime and p <= 113, is 11. These 11 (not necessarily distinct) partitions and their initial primes are as follows: 3[22424], 5[24242], 17[2462], 23[626], 29[2642], 47[662], 53[626], 59[2642], 83[68], 89[842], 113[14]=A000230(7).
