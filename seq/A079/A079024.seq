%N A079024 Let p and q be two prime numbers, not necessarily consecutive, such that q - p = 2n; a(n) is the number of distinct partitions of 2n into even numbers so that each partition corresponds to a consecutive prime difference pattern (k-tuple) and p<=A000230(n). Multiple occurrences of a partition are not counted.
%C A079024 In case of partitions enumerated in A079022-A079024 permutation if parts is relevant since may correspond to different possible consecutive prime-difference patterns.
%e A079024 Only those and distinct partitions are counted which appear not later than prime A000230(n); n=7, d=14, A000230(7)=113, number of solutions to p+14=q, - both p and q are primes and p<=113 - is 9. This 9 distinct partitions and their introducing primes are as follows:3[2244], 5[24242], 17[2462], 23[626], 29[2642], 47[662], 83[68], 89[842], 113[14]=A000230(7).
