%N A079020 Suppose p and q = p+20 are primes. Define the difference pattern of (p,q) to be the successive differences of the primes in the range p to q. There are 56 possible difference patterns, shown in the Comments line. Sequence gives smallest value of p for each difference pattern, sorted by magnitude.
%C A079020 The 56 difference patterns are [20], [2,18], [6,14], [8,12], [12,8], [14,6], [18,2], [2,4,14], [2,6,12], [2,10,8], [2,12,6], [2,16,2], [6,2,12], [6,6,8], [6,8,6], [6,12,2], [8,4,8], [8,6,6], [8,10,2], [12,2,6], [12,6,2], [14,4,2], [2,4,2,12], [2,4,6,8], [2,4,8,6], [2,4,12,2], [2,6,4,8], [2,6,6,6], [2,6,10,2], [2,10,2,6], [2,10,6,2], [2,12,4,2], [6,2,4,8], [6,2,6,6], [6,2,10,2], [6,6,2,6], [6,6,6,2], [6,8,4,2], [8,4,2,6], [8,4,6,2], [8,6,4,2], [12,2,4,2], [2,4,2,4,8], [2,4,2,10,2], [2,4,6,2,6], [2,4,6,6,2], [2,6,4,2,6], [2,6,4,6,2], [2,6,6,4,2], [2,10,2,4,2], [6,2,4,6,2], [6,2,6,4,2], [8,4,2,4,2], [2,4,2,4,6,2], [2,6,4,2,4,2], [2,2,4,2,4,2,4].
%C A079020 Certain patterns are singular, i.e. occur only once like [2,2,4,2,4,2,4]. Impossible patterns are [2,14,4] or [10,10] etc.
%e A079020 p=10091, q=10111 has difference pattern [2, 6, 4, 8] and {10091, 10093, 10099, 10103, 10111} is the corresponding consecutive prime 5-tuple.
