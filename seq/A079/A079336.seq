%F A079336 a(n+1)=0 if and only if (a(1), a(2), ..., a(n), 1), but not (a(1), a(2), ..., a(n), 0), has greater length of longest repeated segment than (a(1), a(2), ..., a(n)) has.
%e A079336 a(8)=1 because (0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0) has repeated segment (1,0,0) of length 3, whereas (0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1) has no repeated segment of length 3.
