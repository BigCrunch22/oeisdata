%N A079325 a(n) is taken to be the smallest positive integer greater than a(n-1) which is consistent with the condition "n is a member of the sequence if and only if a(n) is a member of A079000".

%e A079325 a(2) cannot be 2, which would imply that 2 is a member of A079000 (it is not); letting a(2)=3 creates no contradiction, since 3 is not a member of A079000 and the third term (4) is the next A079000 member in the sequence.
