%N A079937 Greedy frac multiples of Pi^2/6: a(1)=1, Sum_{n>=1} frac(a(n)*x) = 1 at x = Pi^2/6.
%C A079937 The n-th greedy frac multiple of x is the smallest integer that does not cause Sum_{k=1..n} frac(a(k)*x) to exceed unity; an infinite number of terms appear as the denominators of the convergents to the continued fraction of x.
%e A079937 a(4) = 45 since frac(1*x) + frac(2*x) + frac(14*x) + frac(45*x) < 1, while frac(1*x) + frac(2*x) + frac(14*x) + frac(k*x) > 1 for all k > 14 and k < 45.
