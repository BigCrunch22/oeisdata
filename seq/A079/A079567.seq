%N A079567 Number of unlabeled, connected graphs on n vertices which have no induced subgraph isomorphic to a P5, P5-bar or C5 and are not bipartite nor cobipartite and are primes.
%C A079567 P5 = path on five vertices. P5-bar = complement of P5. C5 = cycle on five vertices. Cobipartite means having a bipartite complement. G prime if G has no module (homogeneous set.)
