%N A079797 Products of two primes p and q such that (p*q)^2 + p^2 - q^2 and (p*q)^2 - p^2 + q^2 are both prime.
%C A079797 The two primes generated from p and q are sometimes called flip-flap twin primes. There is probably an infinity of them.
%e A079797 a(2) = 14 since (2*7)^2 + 2^2 - 7^2 = 151 and (2*7)^2 - 2^2 + 7^2 = 241 are both primes.
