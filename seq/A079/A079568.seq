%N A079568 Number of unlabeled, connected graphs on n nodes which have no induced subgraph isomorphic to a P5, P5-bar or C5 and are not bipartite nor cobipartite nor split and are primes.
%C A079568 P5 = path on five nodes. P5-bar = complement of P5. C5 = cycle on five nodes. Cobipartite means having a bipartite complement. G prime if G has no module (homogeneous set.) G split iff G and the complement of G are chordal.
