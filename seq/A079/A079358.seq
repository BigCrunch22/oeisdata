%N A079358 a(n) is taken to be the smallest positive integer greater than a(n-1) which is consistent with the condition "n is a member of the sequence if and only if a(n) is not a multiple of either 3 or 4.".
%C A079358 A generalization of A079000 that, like A079000 itself, is based on a class of numbers comprising exactly one-half of the integers.

%e A079358 a(3) cannot be 3 because that would imply that the third term is not a multiple of 3. 4 is the smallest possible value for a(3) that creates no contradiction; therefore a(3)=4 and the fourth term is the next member of the sequence that is not a multiple of 3 or 4.
%Y A079358 Cf. A079000.
