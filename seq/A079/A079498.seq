%N A079498 Numbers whose sum of digits in base b gives 0 (mod b), for b = 3.
%C A079498 In base 2 this gives the "Evil Numbers" (cf. A001969). One may conjecture that in base b the asymptotic slope will be b and asymptotic density 1/b for each result (mod b). Cases b=31 or b=61 gave considerable number of primes on the sequence.
%C A079498 Proof of this conjecture: in general, the sequence d with terms d(n) = sum of digits of n written in base b (mod b) is a fixed point of the generalized Thue-Morse morphism 0->01..b-1, 1->12..0, etc. See A053839 for the case b=4. It follows directly from this that all symbols have asymptotic density 1/b, and therefore that the positional sequences all have asymptotic slope b. - _Michel Dekking_, Apr 18 2019

%e A079498 83 is a term since 83 = (1,0,0,0,2)_3 and 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 3 == 0 (mod 3).

%Y A079498 Cf. A001969. See A053840 for base b=5. See A141803 for an array with all b.
