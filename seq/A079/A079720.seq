%N A079720 Incorrect duplicate of A062908.
%C A079720 Previous name was: Neve numbers: from ananym of even, like emirp is ananym of prime, non-palindromic even numbers whose reversal, R(n), is also even.

%F A079720 a(n) = 0 (mod 2) and R(n)= 0 (mod 2), but n does not equal R(n).
%e A079720 E.g. a(1) = 24 because R(24) = 42 = 0 (mod 2), while all x<10 are palindromic, all R(x) for 10<x<18 are odd, R(20) and R(22) are palindromic.
