%N A079409 Array T(m,n) (m>=0, n>=0) read by antidiagonals: T(0, 0) = 1, T(0, n) = 0 if n > 0, T(m, n) = T(m-1, n - T(m-1, n)) + T(m-1, n - T(m-1, n-1)) if m > 0.
%C A079409 This two-dimensional array is to Pascal's triangle as the Hofstadter Q-sequence A005185 is to Fibonacci's sequence.
%C A079409 Unlike the Hofstadter Q-sequence, it is very regular and admits a simple closed form: T(m, n) = 0 if n > m, T(m, n) = 1 if n <= m and m - n is even, T(m, n) = n + 1 if n <= m and m - n is odd.
%e A079409 For 0 <= m <= 6 and 0 <= n <= 6, the array looks like:
%e A079409 1,0,0,0,0,0,0
%e A079409 1,1,0,0,0,0,0
%e A079409 1,2,1,0,0,0,0
%e A079409 1,1,3,1,0,0,0
%e A079409 1,2,1,4,1,0,0
%e A079409 1,1,3,1,5,1,0
