%N A079900 a(n) = the smallest positive number which furnishes a "one-line proof" for primality of prime(n), the n-th prime; i.e., the smallest k which is relatively prime to p such that k*(p+k) is divisible by every prime less than sqrt(p), where p=prime(n).
%C A079900 A one-line proof looks like this: 101 = 2*3*3*7 - 5*5. For each prime Q up to the square-root of p(n), either the left product or the right product is divisible by Q, but not both. It follows that the difference is not divisible by any such Q and so is prime. The sequence gives the right (smaller) number.
%C A079900 The idea comes from seqfan postings by _Donald S. McDonald_ and _David W. Wilson_.

%e A079900 a(6)=2: The 6th prime is 13 and the equation 13 = 3*5 - 2 proves it.
