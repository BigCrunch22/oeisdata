%N A079852 a(1) = 1, a(2) = 2, a(3) = 3 and a(n) is the smallest number such that all a(i)*a(j)*a(k) are different.
%C A079852 Note that a(57) = 210 = 2*3*5*7, while 330 = 2*3*5*11 is not in the sequence. This demonstrates that this sequence is not determined by prime signature alone. - _Charles R Greathouse IV_, Oct 17 2015
