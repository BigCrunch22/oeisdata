%N A079101 A repetition-resistant sequence.
%C A079101 a(n) = 0 or 1, chosen so as to maximize the number of different subsequences that are formed.
%C A079101 a(n+1)=1 if and only if (a(1),a(2),...,a(n),0), but not (a(1),a(2),...,a(n),1), has greater length of longest repeated segment than (a(1),a(2),...,a(n)) has.
%C A079101 In Feb, 2003, Alejandro Dau solved Problem 3 on the Unsolved Problems and Rewards website, thus establishing that every binary word occurs infinitely many times in this sequence.
%C A079101 Klaus Sutmer remarks (Jun 26 2006) that this sequence is very similar to the Ehrenfeucht-Mycielski sequence A007061. Both sequences have every finite binary word as a factor; in fact, essentially the same proof works for both sequences.
%C A079101 Differs from A334941 for the first time at n = 70. - _Jeffrey Shallit_, Dec 14 2022

%e A079101 a(7)=1 because (0,1,0,0,0,1,0) has repeated segment (0,1,0) of length 3, whereas (0,1,0,0,0,1,1) has no repeated segment of length 3.
