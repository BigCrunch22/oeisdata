%N A079359 Iterate the process: "sum of terms of n-th run" on the Kolakoski sequence until all runs have length 1.
%C A079359 Is it enough to apply the process three times only to obtain all runs of length 1? Then all terms should have values among 1,4,6 or 8.
%e A079359 Kolakoski sequence begins 1,2,2,1,1,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,2, When process is applied once: 1,2+2,1+1,2,1,2+2,1,2+2, --> 1,4,2,2,1,4,1,4,...Twice: 1,4,2+2,1,4...->1,4,4,1,4 ... Three times -> 1,8,1,4...
