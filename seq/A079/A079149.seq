%N A079149 Primes p such that either p-1 or p+1 has at most 2 prime factors, counted with multiplicity; i.e., primes p such that either bigomega(p-1) <= 2 or bigomega(p+1) <= 2, where bigomega(n) = A001222(n).
%C A079149 There are only 2 primes such that both p-1 and p+1 have at most 2 prime factors - 3 and 5. Proof: If p > 5 then whichever of p-1 and p+1 is divisible by 4 has at least 3 prime factors.
%C A079149 Primes which are not the sum of two consecutive composite numbers. - _Juri-Stepan Gerasimov_, Nov 15 2009
