%N A079473 Number of prime graphs on n vertices. (G is prime iff G has no module. Modules are also called homogeneous sets.)
%C A079473 A set of vertices S is called a module if every vertex outside S either sees all vertices in S or none of them. S must be > 1 and < size of the graph.
%H A079473 F. Hüffner, <a href="https://github.com/falk-hueffner/tinygraph">tinygraph</a>, software for generating integer sequences based on graph properties, version 6e0a59d.
%e A079473 The smallest prime graph and only one on 4 vertices is the 4-path. The 4 graphs on 5 vertices are: P5, C5, House and Bull.
