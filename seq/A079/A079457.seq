%N A079457 Number of unlabeled and connected graphs which are weakly chordal. (G is weakly chordal iff there are no induced cycles of size 5 or more in G nor in its complement.)
%C A079457 Also known as the "weakly triangulated" graphs. Contains the chordal and cochordal graphs and is contained in the class of Perfect graphs.
