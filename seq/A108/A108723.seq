%N A108723 Triangle read by rows: T(n,k) is number of permutations of [n] with ascending runs consisting of consecutive integers and having k fixed points.
%C A108723 T(n,0)=A061547(n). Sum of row n is 2^(n-1) (n>=1).
%F A108723 T(n, 0)=(3/8)2^n + (1/24)(-2)^n - 2/3; T(n, n)=1; T(n, k)=2^(n-k-2) if k>0 and n-k is even; T(n, k)=0 if k>0 and n-k is odd or if k>n.
%e A108723 T(3,0)=2 because we have (23)(1) and (3)(12); T(3,1)=1 because we have (3)(2)(1); T(3,3)=1 because we have (123) (the ascending runs are shown between parentheses).
