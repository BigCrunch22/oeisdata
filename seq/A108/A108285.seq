%N A108285 Triangle read by rows, generated from (1, 2, 3, ...).
%C A108285 By diagonals (d=1,2,3,...) going to the left with (1,3,6,...) = d(1), these are sequences of the form (k-th term a(k) = d*a(k-1) + k). Example: 1, 7, 38, 194, ... (the 5th diagonal) = A014827, is generated by a(k) = 5*a(k-1) + k. Diagonal 2 = (1, 4, 11, 26, ...) = A000295; Diagonal 3 = (1, 5, 18, ...) = A000340; Diagonal 4 = (1, 6, 27, ...) = A014825.
%C A108285 Triangle A108243 is generated by analogous operations from (..., 3, 2, 1) instead of (1, 2, 3, ...).
%F A108285 n-th column = f(x), x = 1, 2, 3, ...; x^(n) + 2*x^(n-1) + 3*x^(n-2) + ... + (n+1).
%e A108285 4th column (offset) = 10, 26, 58, 112, ...= f(x), x = 1, 2, 3; x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 4.
