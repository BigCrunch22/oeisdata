%N A108881 Least positive k such that k * [RSA-2048]^n + 1 is prime, where RSA-2048 is the 617 decimal digit RSA challenge number.
%C A108881 Another term is a(16)=6766. All values in the sequence are Fermat and Lucas PRPs except for the first which was proved with ECM. The larger values won't be easily provable until RSA-2048 is factored, which has a prize of $200000 for its factorization.
