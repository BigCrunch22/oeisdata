%N A108960 n expressed in Fibonacci binary-like number system using only 1's and 2's.
%C A108960 We have, for instance, a(16)=12121 because 16 = 1*(5) + 2*(3) + 1*(2) + 2*(1) + 1*(1) = 1*F(5) + 2*F(4) + 1*F(3) + 2*F(2) + 1*F(1).
%C A108960 Comments from _R. J. Mathar_, Feb 12 2008 (Start) (i) The representation chosen here is that the leftmost digit of a(n) refers to the coefficient of F(1)=1, the second from the left to the coefficient of F(2)=1 etc.
%C A108960 (ii) If one would minimize the length of the representation, one would select a(8)=222 = 2*F(1)+2*F(2)+2*F(3)=2*1+2*1+2*2, with 3 digits, not a(8)=1211 =1*F(1)+2*F(2)+1*F(3)+1*F(4) with four digits.
%C A108960 (iii) If one would minimize the decimal value of a(n), one would get the sequence 1, 2, 12, 22, 121, 112, 122, 222, 1121, 1112 etc.
%C A108960 We are essentially dealing with the output of a web program which does not document which of the non-unique representations is actually chosen. (End)
