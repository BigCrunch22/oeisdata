%F A108053 From _Paolo Xausa_, May 11 2023: (Start)
%F A108053 a(n) = 0 if n <= 4.
%F A108053 For n > 4:
%F A108053 a(n) = 2 if n is odd or n = 6;
%F A108053 a(n) = 3 if n != 6 is even but not divisible by 6;
%F A108053 a(n) = 4 if n = 12;
%F A108053 a(n) = 5 if n != 12 is divisible by 6 but not 30;
%F A108053 a(n) = 7 if n is divisible by 30. (End)
%e A108053 In a 30-gon, there are non-center points where 7 diagonals meet, but no more than 7. Hence a(30) = 7.
