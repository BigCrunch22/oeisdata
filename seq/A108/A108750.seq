%N A108750 Even numbers n such that there exists a solution to lcm(r+s,t) = n-1, lcm(s,r+t) = n-2, r,s>0, t>1, r+s+t <= n.
%C A108750 The alternating groups A_n with n even can be generated by a 3-cycle x=(1,2,3) and an (n-1)-cycle y=(2,3,...n) whose product has cycle type 2 x (n-2). These are called standard generators of A_n. If we assume only that o(y)=n-1 and o(xy)=n-2, then for the values of n in the sequence, y could be the product of 2 cycles (cycle type (r+s).t) and xy can have cycle type s.(r+t). Thus the elements of the sequence give those alternating groups A_n which contain pairs of elements which look like standard generators if one only looks at their orders.
%e A108750 a(1)=58 because we can take r=11, s=8, t=3 giving lcm(19,3)=57, lcm(8,14)=56
