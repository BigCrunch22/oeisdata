%N A108023 a(1)=2; a(n) is the smallest prime such that a(n)-a(n-1) is a 6th power (>0).
%C A108023 Since a(5) is 6 mod 7, all entries after a(5) are congruent to a(5) mod 14^6
%e A108023 a(4)=131 which is 2 mod 3 so if 131 +k^6 is prime, k must be divisible by 6. 131+6^6 and 131+24^6 are divisible by 13, 131 +12^6 and 131+18^6 are divisible by 5, 131+30^6 is divisible by 41, 131+36^6 is prime.
