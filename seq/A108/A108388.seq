%N A108388 Transmutable primes: Primes with distinct digits d_i, i=1,m (2<=m<=4) such that simultaneously exchanging all occurrences of any one pair (d_i,d_j), i<>j results in a prime.
%C A108388 a(n) is a term iff a(n) is prime and binomial(m,2) 'transmutations' (see example) of a(n) are different primes. A083983 is the subsequence for m=2: one transmutation (The author of A083983, Amarnath Murthy, calls the result of such a digit-exchange a self-complement. {Because I didn't know until afterwards that this sequence was a generalization of A083983 and as this generalization always leaves some digits unchanged for m>2, I've chosen different terminology.}). A108389 ({1,3,7,9}) is the subsequence for m=4: six transmutations. Each a(n) corresponding to m=3 (depending upon its set of distinct digits) and having three transmutations is also a member of A108382 ({1,3,7}), A108383 ({1,3,9}), A108384 ({1,7,9}), or A108385 ({3,7,9}). The condition m>=2 only eliminates the repunit (A004022) and single-digit primes. The condition m<=4 is not a restriction because if there were more distinct digits, they would include even digits or the digit 5, in either case transmuting into a composite number. Some terms such as 1933 are reversible primes ("Emirps": A006567) and the reverse is also transmutable. The transmutable prime 3391933 has three distinct digits and is also a palindromic prime (A002385). The smallest transmutable prime having four distinct digits is A108389(0) = 133999337137 (12 digits).

%e A108388 179 is a term because it is prime and its three transmutations are all prime:
%e A108388 exchanging ('transmuting') 1 and 7: 179 ==> 719 (prime),
%e A108388 exchanging 1 and 9: 179 ==> 971 (prime) and
%e A108388 exchanging 7 and 9: 179 ==> 197 (prime).
%e A108388 (As 791 and 917 are not prime, 179 is not a term of A068652 or A003459 also.).
%e A108388 Similarly, 1317713 is transmutable:
%e A108388 exchanging all 1's and 3s: 1317713 ==> 3137731 (prime),
%e A108388 exchanging all 1's and 7s: 1317713 ==> 7371173 (prime) and
%e A108388 exchanging all 3s and 7s: 1317713 ==> 1713317 (prime).
