%N A108234 Minimum m such that n*2^m+k is prime, for k < 2^m. In other words, assuming you've read n out of a binary stream, a(n) is the minimum number of additional bits (appended to the least significant end of n) you must read before it is possible to obtain a prime.
%C A108234 Somewhat related to the Riesel problem, A040081, the minimum m such that n*2^m-1 is prime.

%e A108234 a(12) = 3 because 12 = 1100 in binary and 97 = 1100001 is the first prime that starts with 1100, needing 3 extra bits.
