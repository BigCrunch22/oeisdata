%N A108376 First "domino" sequence.
%C A108376 Take a standard set of 28 dominoes (with 0 to 6 spots) and arrange them in a 1 X 56 rectangle so that an increasing sequence of integers can be read (inserting the necessary commas). Form the sum of all the said integers: this sum cannot be less than 888. This is one of the five sequences of integers corresponding to such an arrangement. See A108377, A108378, A108379, A108392 for the others.
%e A108376 Sequence begins with dominoes [0:1] [2:3] [4:5] [6:1] [1:1] [2:1] [3:1] [4:1] [6:2]...
%Y A108376 The five domino sequences are A108376, A108377, A108378, A108379, A108392.
