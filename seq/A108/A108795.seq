%N A108795 Conjectured greatest number k such that C(2k,k) is not divisible by any odd prime to the n-th power.
%C A108795 Checked by Jack Brennen to 5.93*10^10 and in fact every number beyond 14384056005 was divisible by at least two odd-prime-fourth-powers. C(2*14384056005,14384056005) seems to be the last such number which is only divisible by a single odd-prime-fourth-power, being divisible by 5^9 but by no other prime more than 3 times.

%e A108795 a(1)=1 because for all k's>1 C(2k,k) is divisible by an odd prime.
%e A108795 a(2)=786 because it is the last entry in A059097, i.e., C(1572,786) has no prime factor squared.
