%N A108287 Consider the Diophantine equations x+y=a, x^2+y^2=b, x^3+y^3=c. There are three values of a for each pair b,c with b>0 and c>0. Sequence gives values of b.
%C A108287 From _Andrew Howroyd_, Mar 14 2023: (Start)
%C A108287 The following information was extracted from the Derive script and notes.
%C A108287 The values of x and y are not required to be integers or even real numbers.
%C A108287 Eliminating x and y from the equations gives:
%C A108287    a^3 - 3*a*b + 2*c = 0.
%C A108287 This is the Diophantine equation that is being solved. For a given b and c there will be three possibly complex roots. It is required to find those values of b and c where all three roots are integers.
%C A108287 The values for b are the integers of the form (d^2 + d*e + e^2)/3 where d and e are positive integers and d <= e. This sequence lists these values in order with repetition.
%C A108287 The corresponding values for c are d*e*(d+e)/2 given in A108940, and the three values for a are d, e and -(d+e).
