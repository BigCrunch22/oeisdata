%N A108710 Start to read the sequence digit by digit and erase the first "1" you encounter, then the first "2", the first "3", etc., until the first "0"; go on from there and erase again the first "1", the first "2", etc., until "0" -- and so on, cyclically until the end of the (infinite) sequence. Concatenate what is left. The result is the concatenation of all integers of the sequence.
%C A108710 Fractal-like sequence
%e A108710 Sequence starts: 1 12 13 24 153 627 4819 5031... Erasing cyclically digits 1 --> 0 gives: . 1. 1. 2. 1.3 .2. 4.1. 5.3. which is the pattern of the sequence itself.
