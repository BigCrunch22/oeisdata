%N A108662 Numbers whose sum of squares of digits is a prime.
%C A108662 If m is in the sequence, then so are 10*m and any anagram (even with adding zeros between digits) of m. E.g., 12 is a term, hence 21, 102, 120, 201, 10020 all are here.
%C A108662 A sequence of primitive terms is of interest. It starts with 11, 12, 14, 16, 23, 25, 27, 38, 45, 49, 56, 58, 78, 111, 113, 119, 126, 133, 137, 146, 159, 166, 168, 179, 199. Note that digits are in nondecreasing order. - _Zak Seidov_, Dec 31 2013
