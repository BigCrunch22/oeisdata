%N A108157 Odd numbers n such that there exists a solution to lcm(s,z-s) = n, lcm(t,z-t) = n-2 and 0 < s+t < z < n.
%C A108157 The alternating group on n letters for n>=5 odd can be generated by a 3-cycle x and an (n-2)-cycle y such that xy is an n-cycle. These are called standard generators. If we only know the orders of y and xy (and not their cycle shape) then this sequence gives values of n for which we may be misled into thinking that x and y are standard generators just by looking at their orders (y can be a permutation of shape (z-t)*t and xy can be a permutation of shape (z-s)*s).
%C A108157 Odd numbers n such that there exists a solution to lcm(r+s,t) = n-2, lcm(s,r+t) = n, 0< r,s,t and r+s+t <= n. - _Robert G. Wilson v_, Jun 11 2005
