%N A108579 Number of symmetry classes of 3 X 3 magic squares (with distinct positive entries) having magic sum 3n.
%C A108579 A magic square has distinct positive integers in its cells, whose sum is the same (the "magic sum") along any row, column, or main diagonal.
%C A108579 a(n) is given by a quasipolynomial of period 6.
%C A108579 It appears that A108579(n) is the number of ordered triples (w,x,y) with components all in {1,...,n} and w+n=2x+3y, as in the Mathematica section.  For related sequences, see A211422. - _Clark Kimberling_, Apr 15 2012
