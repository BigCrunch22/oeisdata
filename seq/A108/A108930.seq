%N A108930 A floretion-generated sequence calculated using the rules given for A108618 with initial seed x = + .25'i + .25'k + .25i' - .5j' + .75k' - .25'ij' - .25'ji' - .25'jk' + .25'kj' - .5e; version: basek.
%C A108930 "Version: basek" in the name field is a reference to the floretion k'. It means that in order to calculate a(n), the rule given for A108618: "a(n) is given by twice the coefficient of e (the unit) in y from step 4 inside the n-th loop." should be replaced by "a(n) is given by 4 times the coefficient of k' in y from step 4 inside the n-th loop." This sequence appears to be unbounded. Moreover, (a(n)) produces a "spiral" when plotted against sequences from the same batch (i.e. against versions: tes, ves etc.). Ray-traced plots similar to the one given in the link can be formed using this sequence (for example). (a(n)) appears to become more "predictable" with increasing n. For n in the range from 987 to 1000 we have: a(987) = -59, a(988) = 112, a(989) = -52, a(990) = -55, a(991) = 108, a(992) = -51, a(993) = -53, a(994) = 109, a(995) = -55, a(996) = -51, a(997) = 107, a(998) = -54, a(999) = -50, a(1000) = 109
