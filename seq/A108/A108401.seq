%N A108401 A Langford-like sequence.
%C A108401 Construction rules: 1) a(n) < a(n+1) 2) if you pick any digit "d" of the sequence, the closest identical one is at exactly "d" digits from it (jumping to the right or to the left).
%e A108401 Pick the leftmost "5" and jump 5 digits (to the right): you'll land on another "5".
%e A108401 Pick the third "6" (visible in 63) and jump 6 digits (to the right): you'll land on another "6" (161). [Jumping again 6 digits from there to the right would send you on another "6" (286), which is allowed].
%e A108401 Pick the first "0" (300) and jump 0 digits (to the right): you'll move to the next digit, which is a "0".
%e A108401 Note that the rule (2) forbids integers like "323" because if you pick one of those 3's the *closest* copy is at a "1" jump -- and not at a "3" jump, which is mandatory.
