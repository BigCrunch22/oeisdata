%N A108988 A (twin's digits) self-disappearing sequence.
%C A108988 Two identical digits forming a pair disappear instantly, even if they belong to two successive integers [112 -> 2], [111 -> 1], [13,37 --> 1,7].
%e A108988 This strictly increasing sequence begins with 1. The next integer must be the smallest one which makes disappear *all* the previous ones [thus after 1 put 10, leaving a single 0 after disappearance of the two 1's; now the smallest integer which makes disappear this 0 is 110 -- leaving nothing in the sequence; the next integer will be 111 -- because if a(n) erases all previous digits *and* all digits of a(n) itself, the next integer should be a(n)+1]
