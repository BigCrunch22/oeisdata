%N A108760 Irregular array: n-th row consists of nonnegative integers i less than n such that n divides i(i+1).
%C A108760 Row n starts with 0 and ends with n-1.
%C A108760 Row n of this irregular array can be viewed as the first row of an infinite matrix with elements a_{j,i} = T(n,i)+n*j. That matrix consists of all nonnegative integers i such that n divides i(i+1).
%C A108760 I use these matrices to generate subsequences of A012132, as you may see on page 9 of my referenced work.
