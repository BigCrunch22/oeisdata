%N A108216 Number of semiprimes between 10n and 10n + 9.
%C A108216 a(60) = a(82) = a(142) = 0. - _Jonathan Vos Post_, Jun 16 2005
%e A108216 a(0) = 3 because between 0 and 9 there are three semiprimes: 4, 6 and 9.
%e A108216 a(1) = 3 because between 10 and 19 there are three semiprimes: 10, 14 and 15.
