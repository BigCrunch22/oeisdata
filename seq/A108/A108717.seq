%N A108717 An erroneous sequence.
%C A108717 Old name was: A model of LQTL "possible world lines" as a balanced binary tree with four successors (S4S). Each path through the tree creates a unique "word" describing the linked nodes. Four iterations generate the sequence which is extensible. Qubits mapped to a balanced binary tree.
%C A108717 For this sequence qubits have been represented as 11, 12, 21, 22, rather than the more common 00, 01, 11, 10. With the latter encoding the sequence would be 00000000, 00000001, 00000101, 00000111, 00000101, 00010111, 00011111, 00011110.

See presentation materials, slide 14. Note that a(4) in this sequence entry has a typo: according to the slides, it should be 11121212, representing the bit sequence 00010101.
