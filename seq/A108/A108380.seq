%N A108380 Least number of distinct n-th roots of unity summing to the smallest possible nonzero magnitude.
%C A108380 Myerson writes about the unsolved problem of finding a good lower bound on the least magnitude as a function of n. Note that a(n)<n/2 for n>2 because the sum of all n-th roots of unity is 0.

%e A108380 a(8)=3 because the least nonzero magnitude is sqrt(2)-1, which is the sum of three 8th roots of unity.
%Y A108380 Cf. A103314 (number of subsets of the n-th roots of unity summing to zero).
