%N A108755 Number of finite simple groups possessing an irreducible representation of dimension n.
%C A108755 The sequence starts at 2 because all finite simple groups have an irreducible representation of dimension 1 (namely the trivial representation).
%H A108755 G. Hiss and G. Malle, <a href="http://www.lms.ac.uk/jcm/4/lms2000-014/">Low-dimensional representations of quasi-simple groups</a>, LMS J. Comput. Math. 4 (2001) 22-63, corrigenda in same J. 5 (2002) 95-126.
%e A108755 a(3)=2 because A_5 and L2(7) are the only finite simple groups to have irreducible representations of dimension 3.
%o A108755 (GAP) Simple := AllCharacterTableNames(IsSimple, true); list := List([1..16], x->0); for G in Simple do k := List(Irr(CharacterTable(G)), x->x[1]); for i in [1..16] do if i in k then list[i] := list[i] + 1; fi; od; od; # Note that we stop at 16 because currently GAP does not have the character table of A18 (which has a 17-dimensional representation)
