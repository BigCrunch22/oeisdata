%N A108711 Number of partitions of n with floor(2n/3) parts.
%C A108711 It would be interesting to know whether the sequence continues with runs of length 3 of terms of equal values.
%C A108711 The number of partitions of n with floor(2n/3) = A004523(n) parts equals the number of partitions of n with maximum part floor(2n/3). This leaves n-floor(2n/3) = ceiling(n/3) = A002264(n+2) as the sum of all the other parts, with no further restriction since floor(2n/3) >= ceiling(n/3) remains the largest part for any partition of the remainder, at least for n > 1. Since A002264 triplicates the integers, this sequence here triplicates the entries of A000041. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jul 31 2010, Feb 22 2012
%e A108711 The partitions of 6 are {{6},{5,1},{4,2},{4,1,1},{3,3},{3,2,1},{3,1,1,1},{2,2,2},{2,2,1,1},{2,1,1,1,1},{1,1,1,1,1,1}}, of which 2 have 4 parts. Thus a(6)=2.
