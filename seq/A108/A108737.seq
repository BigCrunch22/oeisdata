%N A108737 Start with S = {}. For m = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... let u be the binary expansion of m. If u is not a substring of S, append the minimal number of 0's and 1's to S to remedy this. Sequence gives S.
%e A108737 We construct S as follows, starting with S = {}.
%e A108737 0 is missing, so S = {0};
%e A108737 1 is missing, so S = {0,1};
%e A108737 10 is missing, so S = {0,1,0};
%e A108737 11 is missing, so S = {0,1,0,1,1};
%e A108737 100 is missing, so S = {0,1,0,1,1,0,0};
%e A108737 101 and 110 are visible, but 111 is missing, so S = {0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1}; etc.
