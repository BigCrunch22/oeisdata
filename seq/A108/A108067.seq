%N A108067 Integers in alphabetical order in U.S. English (another version of A004740).
%C A108067 The last term of this infinite sequence is 0. - _Lekraj Beedassy_, Mar 09 2006
%C A108067 The penultimate term using the accepted naming convention would be TWO VIGINITILLION TWO UNDECILLION TWO TRILLION TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWO. Because not all numbers have names, the sequence would not truly be infinite. - _Matthew Goers_, Jan 11 2012
%C A108067 The sequence does not count spaces and hyphens when alphabetizing. If spaces were counted, eight billion eight million would be after eight billion eight. - _Charles Coker_, Jul 29 2019
%C A108067 If spaces were counted, then eight billion eight hundred (and then many other terms, starting with eight billion eight hundred eight) would follow eight billion eight. These would all precede eight billion eight million (mentioned above). The current sequence's eight billion eighteen would not occur until after many more intervening terms. - _Michael S. Branicky_, Aug 17 2022 [clarified Oct 04 2023]
