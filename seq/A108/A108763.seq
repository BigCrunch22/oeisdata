%N A108763 If n-th prime is 8m+1, then a(n) = 8m+3. If n-th prime is 8m+3, then a(n) = 8m+5. If n-th prime is 8m+5, then a(n) = 8m+7. If n-th prime is 8m+7, then a(n) = 8m+1.
%C A108763 a(n) is asymptotically equal to prime(n). There are infinitely many a(n) > a(n) and infinitely many a(n+1) < a(n). There are arbitrarily large gaps between a(n) and a(n+1) for sufficiently large n. If Goldbach's conjecture is true, this sequence contains infinitely many primes. Conjecture: for any whole number k, there exists at least one a(n) with exactly k prime factors (for k = 3, for instance, 8*20 + 3 = 163 which is prime and the sequence includes 8*20 + 5 = 3 x 5 x 11).

%F A108763 a(n) = 8*quotient(n-th prime, 8) + mod(2 + n-th prime, 8) = 2 + n-th prime unless mod(n-th prime, 8) = 7 then -6 + n-th prime.
%e A108763 Prime(1) = 2, which is not of the form 8m+1, 8m+3, 8m+5, nor 8m+7, hence this sequence starts with a(2) = 5 because prime(2) = 8*0 + 3, so 8*0+5 = 5.
%e A108763 Prime(11) = 31 = 8*3 + 7, so a(11) = 8*3 + 1 = 25 = 5^2, which happens not to be a prime.
