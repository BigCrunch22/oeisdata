%N A108575 Numbers k such that the continued fraction for sqrt(k) is multiplicative.
%C A108575 m^2 - m < a(n) < m^2 for some m.
%e A108575 The continued fraction for sqrt(7) is c = (2, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 4, ...) = A010121. If we index starting at 0, so that c(0) = 2, c is multiplicative (the value at c(0) is immaterial). Hence 7 is in the sequence.
%Y A108575 Cf. A010121, A109054 (with squares included).
