%N A108214 Denominator of the O(x^2) term in the Maclaurin series of the square of the Jacobi polynomial P^{a,b}_n(z) about z=1-x for real positive x.
%C A108214 The sequence starts at n=2 because the n=1 and n=0 terms are not quadratic in x and the denominator of 0 is undefined.
%C A108214 This sequence arises out of my preliminary investigation into the square-summability of the Jacobi polynomials, i.e., does Sum_{n=0}^ infinity {P^{a,b}_n(z)}^2 exist?
