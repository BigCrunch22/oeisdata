%N A108322 "Binary prime squares": a(n) = n^2 written in base 2 and interpreted as a base-10 number, if that number is prime; a(n) = 0 otherwise.
%C A108322 Another definition: numbers having only digits 1 and 0, which, read in base 10 are primes and in base 2 are perfect squares.

%e A108322 a(5)=0 because 5^2 = 25 = 11001_2, and the decimal number 11001 is not prime.
%e A108322 a(29)=1101001001 because 29^2 = 841 = 1101001001_2, and the decimal number 1101001001 is prime.
